| 0:00:31| Meeting please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Miss Erica.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=31)|
| 0:00:37| The Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=37)|
| 0:01:07| So do we have any elected officials here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=67)|
| 0:01:22| Just a reminder that Knox County schools will be closed for winter break December 20th through the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| We hope for a well-deserved restful break for all their students families and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| Teachers will report back for the spring semester on Monday January 3rd and students will return to class on Tuesday January 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=93)|
| 0:01:42| And also Monday January 3rd will start our new schedule where we meet on Monday Wednesday of the same week for board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=102)|
| 0:01:52| Board members you received an email yesterday but I wanted to know publicly that legal reference updates and clarifications were made to policies J353, J357 and J390.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=112)|
| 0:02:05| And a cross-reference was added to policy J350 as requested by Miss Owen at last week's work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=125)|
| 0:02:13| For item 10C regarding our superintendent search a draft brochure and the interim report from TSBA is attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=133)|
| 0:02:21| And I would like to move that item to be considered prior to our consent agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| Are there any other requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| Mr. Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Thank you Madam Chair. Would it be possible to add a board form at this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| And Miss Henderson and Miss Babb are stuck in construction traffic but they will be here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=162)|
| 0:02:50| So do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| A motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Miss Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| All in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| And so Superintendent Thomas do we want to wait for the Hardin Valley recognition for Miss Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=185)|
| 0:03:14| It might be better if we could for Miss Henderson to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| She should be here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| Did you have a report? Anything else? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=201)|
| 0:03:36| So Miss Satterfield I guess we will move into the superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| Awesome. Well great. I thought we were going to be at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| Lucky for you Tammy. Is that okay for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| Awesome. So we have the last few weeks we have been collecting data with the survey results for the superintendent criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=228)|
| 0:03:57| and what the community wants to see in the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| We also had a series of community forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| We also had a student forum that Raymond gave us updates about at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| And so all of the data is compiled and Tammy is going to, Dr. Tammy Grissom from Tennessee School Board Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| is going to give us the update and board ideally we will be able to ask her questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=254)|
| 0:04:21| but the goal from today is that we will adopt the criteria and we also will have full understanding of the process moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=261)|
| 0:04:29| And so I would like for us to make sure that we get all of our questions out or anything that we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| And we do have a public forum on this. Do you want to do it now or do you want to do it later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| Right. And well actually now that Miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| I'm sorry Dr. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Well since Miss Henderson is here we do have some student recognition so maybe we could do that first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| and then we will get right back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Okay. Pause that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Thank you Madam Chair. It's always a pleasure and an honor to recognize our schools, our principals, our students and teachers for their accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=294)|
| 0:05:02| So I'd like to take a few minutes this evening to recognize one of our high schools for receiving national recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| and its ongoing commitment to inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Hardin Valley Academy is just one of over a dozen schools in the state designated as a Special Olympics Unified Champion School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=310)|
| 0:05:18| which promotes meaningful social inclusion and a sense of collaboration, engagement and respect for all members of the student body and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=318)|
| 0:05:26| Earlier this year the school received national banner recognition from the Special Olympics for its efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| This means the school has met ten national standards of excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| HVA is the first and only school in the state to be named a National Unified Champion School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| To celebrate this honor the school held a pep rally featuring an exhibition game by the unified basketball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| speakers from Hardin Valley Academy and Special Olympics Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| We're so proud of Hardin Valley Academy, its students and staff for earning this very deserving recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| Please join me in congratulating Hardin Valley Academy and Dr. Spees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| and if your group would come forward we'd like to present you with a certificate and get a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=365)|
| 0:06:35| Alright, we ready? Here we go. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=395)|
| 0:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=425)|
| 0:07:25| Alright, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=445)|
| 0:07:46| So just to update board member Henderson and Babb, we moved up the superintendent conversation so that we can, at the front of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=466)|
| 0:07:55| So that's what we're about to go into now. So yeah, going back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| So our community, but before we get with you Dr. Grissom, if we can start with our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| We have a public forum speaker. I know, it's okay, you know, we're here, we're going to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| Mr. McCoy, if you can come up. You have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=491)|
| 0:08:19| Good evening, Lance McCold, Knox County. Thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=499)|
| 0:08:27| First I want to say that I am going to talk about the NAACP recommendations for the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| but I'm not speaking for the NAACP. I'm doing what anybody could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| Look at what the NAACP has said and compare it with what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=519)|
| 0:08:47| I guess the first thing I want to do is say that it doesn't, I can't find any evidence in this proposed criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=527)|
| 0:08:57| or the document that the NAACP recommended criteria are reflected in this or considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| There's been very little time. This thing only dropped late yesterday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| So I might have missed it, but I don't see it either in the recommendations or the discussion in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| And if it's there and I act like it's not, my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| So one of the things that the NAACP recommended is that we should look for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=564)|
| 0:09:31| who have demonstrated the ability to implement Knox County's vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| which includes increasing student achievement, eliminating disparities, and creating a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=576)|
| 0:09:45| And that is not listed in the recommended criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| I do think that if, you know, our strategic plan and its priorities ought to be front and center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=591)|
| 0:10:02| I think that the criteria look to me to be inconsistent and weak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| In some places the proposed criteria use strong expression senses, a record of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| or has demonstrated for some criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| But for other criteria it uses weak things like has experience, has the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| Many people have ability and experience, but our students and our community deserve a superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| with a record of successes, not just ability and experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| So these criteria need to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| Some of the criteria in the TSBA recommendations appear to be TSBA opinions more than stakeholder comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=640)|
| 0:10:50| One of the ones that jumped out at me, and of course I had way too little time to really look at things exhaustively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| is one of the recommendations is that the candidate should have a record of working effectively with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| and keeping the board well informed, sharing credit for accomplishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| and enhancing reputation and effectiveness of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| I don't see anything, and I haven't heard anything where anybody was saying that they wanted the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| the superintendent to be there to enhance the reputation of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| And frankly I don't think that that's the superintendent's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| Their job is to run the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Thank you, Mr. McCoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| That was three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| So as board, as we continue to look over the criteria and what we're going to adopt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| the ultimate goal of this session today is for us to move forward with the criteria so we can get it out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| and start recruiting candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| And so whatever recommendation that you have or any changes, let's make them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| Just a point of order, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| I don't think we had a motion and a second on the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| I think we need to do that for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| Because it was discussion and possible action, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| Somebody could make the possible action, I guess, after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| I thought we had to make a motion to have the discussion, but maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| I mean, you all can have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| You all decided to move it up to the front of the pecking order anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| but Madam Chair is correct that if anybody wants to do any type of action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| then that would require a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Now, Dr. Tammy Grissom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| if you can please give us the report from what was shared from our community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| And thank you, members of the board and the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| I have placed it, or Terry did, rather, at your seats, and she also made copies as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| You got it emailed to you last night is this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| If we could just start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| I'm not going to obviously read all the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| but our job was to take the comments from the online surveys, which were we received 1,446 online surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=781)|
| 0:13:11| and it had lots of comments, and then we conducted the meetings last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| and so from all the information we gathered at the meetings is included in this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| and also your student representative, as you have noted, did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| Thank you very much for conducting the student forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Their report, as they wrote the report, we just put it as is at the end of our report so you can see exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| So thank you very much for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| The meetings were also, at each of the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| they were asked to complete a criteria preference ranking on 20-plus items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| and we're going to review that in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| That's where we get a lot of our proposed criteria, but we take the criteria, the comments that were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| So any comments that were given to us, they're reflected in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| If I were not given something, it's not in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| So we took our notes from the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| We took our comments from the online surveys, and then some participants at the meetings handed us comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=851)|
| 0:14:20| and then a lot of participants would write their comments on the back of the forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| They didn't want to speak during the meeting, but they made comments on the back of the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| So all of those are reflected in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| We conducted, if you'll go to page one, we list there the, we had seven, six meetings that we conducted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=873)|
| 0:14:41| and we conducted those in the same manner and asked, we asked three questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| They're on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| What are the good things going on that you'd like to see continue if a new superintendent coming in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| What programs or services that you'd like to see continued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Then we asked what problems or challenges a new superintendent will face coming into the new position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| and what personal characteristics that you'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| And if you'll look on page two, the most common responses to the question about what are the good things going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=905)|
| 0:15:14| and there were lots of comments, as you can see from this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| but some of the most common were project grad, restorative interventions, your office of school culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| CTE, caring teachers and staff, and relationships with community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| The most common responses to the question about challenges was the effects of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| teacher and staff shortages, disparities in education, inequalities among schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| recruitment of diverse staff, and a divided board of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| When asked about the personal characteristics, the most common responses were good listener,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| experience in the classroom, a strong leader, and someone that is focused on students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| Now let's jump to starting on page five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| That's an overview, and I know you all have had a chance to look at that yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| That's an overview of all comments from each of the meetings that we conducted in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| and then we also include all the comments that were made on the 1,400 online surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| And then if you go starting on page 20 is the exact report from the student forums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=986)|
| 0:16:38| and that's on pages 20 and I think through 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| And then if you'll look on page 29, these were the 21 things that we asked participants to rank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1004)|
| 0:16:53| these different criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| And you will see on this form we highlighted the top ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| So that's where we got a lot of our criteria was from the ranking of this chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| of these items, and from the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| So that is that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| And if we can flip back to page 28, based on the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| and then I have spoken with some of you individually, on page 28,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| this is the proposed criteria that we are presenting to the board for your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| You can adopt as is, you can change it all, whatever, but this is a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| So with that, Madam Chairman, I'm open for any discussion or questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| And Mr. Watson, or Ms. Babb, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Dr. Grissom, I have a question for you a little bit, and this is more just a procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| about the format, like, I mean, the way this is is as a brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| So I guess my question is, and this is where I don't know enough about how we seek out these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| Since it's being done as this kind of brochure type thing, is it mailed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| Because in my mind, in the way we're all digital and everything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| probably a digital flyer or something would be something people would see more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| Because when I did, like, read this online and everything, since it's formatted as a brochure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| it's very hard to read if you just read the digital version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| So I kind of did want to ask about that, why we're doing this kind of formatting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| which I know has nothing to do with the substance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| It's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| We can do whatever method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| We do email it out, but we do mail it sometimes to some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Like, we also gave people the opportunity, if they would like, for us to send any candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| that they think would be good candidates, we'll send a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| and we typically will put a brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| But it is no problem for us to revise the format and make it just a front and back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| more like a flyer for the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| So whatever you all want to do, we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| I think for anybody getting it digitally, I think when it's formatted as a brochure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| it's very hard to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| So that would just be my only recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| That has nothing to do with substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| No, it's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| My question, and then this maybe is another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| This is on the procedures and superintendent search process, which is on page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| Yes, I was going to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| You want us to wait on that, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| I'd kind of like to do the criteria, and then let's go to the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| But you can do it whatever method you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| I didn't know if we were getting to that later, so I have a question about that when we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Then probably the only thing, kind of, substance that I kind of wanted to address was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| and it's under the district part, and I just felt like it was sort of not real cohesive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| It's like the fourth paragraph down when we just talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| and the district has partnered with community organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| I just felt like that did not flow very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| And, I mean, I don't mind trying to write something better or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| but just even kind of like starting a paragraph with and, and I didn't know if we maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| and I kind of tried to reach out to some of our staff people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| maybe kind of even giving a little bit more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| which obviously we're limited in space and not doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| but just being like, you know, that we're partnering with mental health professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| You know, maybe putting a little bit more substance into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| Space should not be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| Honestly, this is a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| You all can have 20 criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| So any changes you want to make, Madam Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| I don't know what the most efficient way to do that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| but if some of you have several, I know Daniel has several changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| it might be better instead of us doing this at a board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| that perhaps maybe your changes to the brochure could be given to Terry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| and she can get with our staff and we can make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Would that, once we discuss and we all agree to the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| would that be a better process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| It's hard to edit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| So you're agreeing on the changes tonight and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| I think we need to agree on the criteria, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| the layout I can do at the office or if there's some editorial type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| I don't know if there's a lot of you that have changes, and if you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| did you bring them printed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| I know Daniel, we have his, and everyone has a copy of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| I don't mean to call you out, but I do have a copy of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I guess my, Madam Chairman, I guess my question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| whatever changes that we need to, we got to vote on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| We don't have to, but if we don't vote on it, then it delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| And so whatever changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| if we can lift them up on what that paragraph would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| and if the board can agree to that, then we can submit it to Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| But today's the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Is it possible, just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| is it possible to vote on the substance of the criteria and not the exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| I mean, we're basically developing a marketing piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| and we don't typically vote on marketing pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| So, I mean, can we vote on the substance and not the exact wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| Mr. DuPont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Yes, the board can do a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| The board can do, you know, either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| So if you wanted to vote on some specific language that perhaps is from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| Mr. Watson's edits, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| But on the other hand, if, as Ms. Babb says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| she would rather have a different format, you can say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| we're going to put it in a different format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| I mean, you know, so you can vote on concepts or specific language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| But whatever you vote on, if you're voting on a concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| just you all need to understand that there could be some tweaks in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| language, and then it will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| And thank you for saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| because I think that's the point of these ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Like number one is if you want the criterion to be effective listener,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| that's what number one is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| If you don't want that to be one, we need to mark that one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| But if you're okay with that being one of the criteria for this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| we can leave it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| If we need to tweak the sentence and verbs, that kind of thing, we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| But I think, you know, number two is a change agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| That's what number two is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Now, if we need to reword the sentence, obviously we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| But I think if we can agree on what the main items are is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| I think we could do that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| Can I make some general comments about just what I tried to intend to do as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| a whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| And then also I want to speak to the report, Dr. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Really appreciate all your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| I know you had very little and your team had very little time to turn this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| And I know you processed a lot of criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| And I know any time I've tried to generate themes from surveys and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| comments, I mean, it is a task to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| So I really appreciate all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| One thing, just with the report, I think we're going to possibly want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| end up publishing this online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Before we do that, I think it would be fairly simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| I wonder if, like, on the online survey and the other areas that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| numbers next to them, when somebody says, hey, this comment was made 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| times or whatever, if we could put those in order in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| frequency at which it was said, I think that will make it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| easier for people to process through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| I think that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| And then when I looked at the brochure and the criteria, based upon the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| feedback, and I did look at the letter from the NAACP, too, in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| estimation, most everything that the NAACP plus the other criteria or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| other comments that we had I think is fairly reflective in those ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| And I also don't know that we want to have much more than ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| So my intent in the edits was actually nothing substantive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| It was really about making it a little bit easier to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| The criteria themselves were written as incomplete sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| And so I think if we're sending this out to potential superintendents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| like they have all had periods with them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| We just need to remove the periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| A lot of the online, you have to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| I didn't want to reword.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| We put it in as it was typed in online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| No, no, I don't mean in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| I mean in the brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Oh, yeah, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| So in the brochure, yeah, I'm sure there's lots of comments in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| report that are not complete sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| I'm talking about in the brochure and the edits that I tried to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| So the only thing that I thought we needed to remove was under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| position, and it's actually word for word our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| And these words are actually reflective in other school board policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| across the state I looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| But it's actually not very meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| And I don't know that we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| And I talked to Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Grissom before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| That certificate of qualifications issued by the State Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Education doesn't even exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| So like to include that might mean that people disqualify themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| because they don't have something that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I would just remove that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| And then everything else that I tried to do was just to make a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| bit easier to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| And then in the district portion under the system facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| those were all duplicated in the paragraphs above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| I didn't think we needed to repeat them twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| So I used that section instead to list student demographics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| which if I'm a superintendent, potential superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| I would want those demographics listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| I just lifted that from our strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| which was probably not been edited in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| So those particular demographics probably need to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| So do you all have the red line version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Do you all have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| So I just got rid of the system facts section and put student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| demographics because I thought everything else in the system facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| was listed above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| And I felt like it was important to list KCS as the third largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| I think that's an important thing for folks to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| And the other minor fact that I added was that we are governed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| that the superintendent and the system is governed by a board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| nine board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| So I added that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| but everything else was just trying to make it easier to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| But I thought that the criteria was pretty reflective of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| comments that we got from, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| the NAACP and all the other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| Thank you for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| And I did want to mention about the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| I know all of you know this, but just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| in order to be a superintendent in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| all that is required by law is a bachelor's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| There's no longer any superintendent endorsement or certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| Ms. Shellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Since we just got this information yesterday and are trying to turn it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| around in one day, I think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| I think it's a poor practice for us to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| Looking at the calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| we have two business weeks before our next meeting and two holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| I would strongly suggest that we put this off and have a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| called meeting before our January 3rd meeting so that we can have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| time to actually consider this criteria and some time to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| Ms. Babb, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| I don't know who was sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Tammy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| thank you for all the work that you've put into getting all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| organized to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I agree with Daniel about the NAACP letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| I feel like that the points made are included in here in some form or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| I think that just the brochure itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| I like only having 10 criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| I feel like if you get more than that, it gets too wordy and just too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| So I think we need to make sure that we talk about and agree on which 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| criteria it should be, but I think we should limit it to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| And the system facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I see your point about listing the demographics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| but I really think that this is sufficient the way it's listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| I feel like if somebody's really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| really interested in our district that they're probably going to get on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| website and poke around and see what else they can learn about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| I feel like that it's, you know, I think you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| you can learn a lot just by glancing quickly at those system facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| So I guess I would like to hear what other board members think about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| because I'm certainly not opposed to doing it the way you've suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| but this is just so clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| I would just like to hear some other feedback from other board members on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| And then the other thing that I've noted is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| I think that, well, one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| I think we do need to make sure we add that we would definitely want a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| master's degree or let's talk about that criteria because that's not listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| So we probably need to discuss that. And then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| in looking at the 10 criteria and I'm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| I'm not even sure Tammy, if that would be part of the 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| or if it would be listed separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| It's typically listed under the position. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| And I think that's what Daniel was referring to under position in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| brochure, that second paragraph, we lifted that from your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| And so your policy, if you want to make a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| that's where I would suggest it go is the minimum qualifications under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| position section. Okay. All right. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| I would say maybe we need to just maybe walk through each criteria and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| sure that everybody likes these criteria and make sure, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| and then I'm fine with, if we decide on which criteria we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| and then the wording is finessed after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| I feel confident that that can be done and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| without us having to sit here and talk through every single word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| So I think it would be more efficient just to make sure we go through all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| criteria. And I think those are the points I had at the moment. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| Ms. Henderson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| I just want to say Daniel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| thank you so much for taking the time to go over this and present these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| changes. I agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| I agree with what you've said in your changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I actually liked the student demographics because it puts more emphasis on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| our students versus putting emphasis on the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| And so I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| I really liked that part and just want to thank you for these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| I really like everything that you put in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| Ms. Babb. Yeah, this is something minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| but I thought I'd bring it up because it's not addressed in the edits that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| Daniel made, but on the application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| I did found this a little bit confusing down below it says apply online and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| has our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| And then when it talks about a screening committee will review candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| qualifications matches qualifications, the boards stated criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| The only reason I think because y'all are a board TSBA and we're a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| I thought it would be good to clarify Knox County schools board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| I just thought that could be confusing since we're hiring TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| I'm assuming we mean Knox County schools board there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| but I did think that in that paragraph below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| that might be good to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| That was the only thing just because especially since TSBA is the one that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| doing it, I thought that could be a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| And that was just a very minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| But I also probably agree with Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| I mean, I think I kind of agree with what everybody's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| I don't think we need to nitty gritty on the words and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| I didn't get that deep down detail, but I would like almost just to go one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Can we agree on one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| I guess maybe first we need to decide Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| Owen's recommendation of if we put it off or if we're okay to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| And if we're okay to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| then I would like us to go basically through one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Do we all agree on one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| Do we not agree on one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Is there another one we do not necessarily getting into the exact wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| but the general concept to just go through those 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| And I'm going to go to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Are you, were you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| I'll come back to you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Now, do we want to go to deciding whether we're going to put it off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Or are we still talking about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| I think we should make that decision because if that's the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| then we can move on with the agenda for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| I will make the motion that we move forward with our timeline as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2033)|
| 0:34:01| have previously discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| So we have a motion by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| McMillan to proceed with the timeline we voted on and a second by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| So is there any discussion, further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| I would agree with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| McMillan, and I think Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| Grissom has driven here from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| And so it would be nice to have her input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| I don't think it's fair to ask her to come back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| It would be nice to have her input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| And I really think we need to have a discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| I'm not sure how we can move forward unless we talk about it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| we have all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| I think that the point we need where we are is we need to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| And that's what our plan is to do tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| So I think we should go forward, go through it and discuss this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| so that we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| So I don't know who's next on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| To the motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| If it were me, I would have slowed everything down, but I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| done it weeks and months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| And we've kind of talked about this several times in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| timeline as a board, and we've agreed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| So I don't I don't want us to agree and backtrack and agree and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| backtrack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| And so I would be for keeping on our timeline only because we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| discussed the issue and we've made a decision to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| And I don't think anybody's surprised that we're getting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| report tonight because we just did the we just did the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| last week and it would have been like a superhero effort to turn it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| around any quicker to get it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| I mean, we came to the meeting tonight planning to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| criteria again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| I would have slowed it down, but I would have done it weeks ago when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| we discussed it and we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| So I think we need to move forward with what we plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| I just want to be sure that it's in the record that we did our due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| diligence the last time we had a superintendent search and we spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| a lengthy, lengthy workshop going over criteria, determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| criteria, figuring out what we as a board wanted in our next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| And I'm not sure that we are meeting to the definition of due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| diligence the way we are doing this this time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2184)|
| 0:36:34| Yes, I will like to just just as the chair of the committee to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| also go on the record to say that this is the will of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| and the board has voted numerous times that we want to stick with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| the timeline and this is the timeline that's been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| I will make sure that we can that I reiterate that from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| beginning that I've been communicating to board members to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| with what you want to see in a superintendent from criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| because we knew that this point was going to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| So I had I came with the expectation that we as board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| are prepared for what we want in a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| I know what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| I'm prepared to go into the criteria and that's the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| that I have for other board members as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| No more discussion on the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| So we have a motion by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| MacMillan to proceed with the current timeline and a second by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| So all in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Any opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| So Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Satterfield do you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Criteria one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2265)|
| 0:37:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| So if we can look at the selection criteria one by one and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| anybody I guess the best format is to say if we if anybody has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| any opposition to that criteria let us know if not we'll we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| move on we'll adopt it and then we'll move on and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| take one final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| First criteria one who has demonstrated effective listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| abilities and who has a commitment to accessibility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| willingness to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Oh should I go by Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| This would be my one suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| You know I think you said it's opposition but I think it's if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| we go through it and you might do it but if there's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| major substantive you know you might want listening but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| something major not just wordsmithing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| You know go ahead and talk about that because I mean I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| that I haven't read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| I haven't had the ability to read his to say what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| And so I probably go by this and then somebody's got some major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| thoughts on a way of really crafting it a lot differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| Bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| So as you're lying on Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Mike I want to say so if I can be recognized this might not work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2337)|
| 0:39:07| but in reference to these things that are red line would it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2347)|
| 0:39:16| possible for us to just look through take a few minutes look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| through and we could even do it you know like take the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| three and if there's a word that somebody needs to change or feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| strongly about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| But it appears to me that in some instances I think let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2376)|
| 0:39:48| number four is not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| I don't see any red lines there but everything else including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| the last one over there where it talks about has demonstrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| the ability to work effectively with diverse student populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| and multicultural groups within the and then insert school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2407)|
| 0:40:15| and the broader community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Why is it necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| I mean everybody in the world that's looking at this would know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| we're talking about the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| It's not like we're talking about something you know some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| foreign like you know water system or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| It appears to me that somebody went somebody went through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| and just for the sake of creating fancy language for lack of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| better term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| I don't think any of this is necessary in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| I mean you could maybe you could change a word here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| But you know somebody that's going to apply for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| They're going to research it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| You know if you use a phrase like a visionary leader as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2469)|
| 0:41:18| to a highly qualified person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| Do you really think that's going to snap their attention and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| them to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| But anyway I just want to render my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| Miss Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| I would suggest for number one taking Mr. Watson's suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| with the exception of the word has and just begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| exceptional listening skills and continue with a commitment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| accessibility and an open door policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Miss Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| I think we have to figure out if we're going to vote on either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| just on the substance and maybe later vote on if we adopt the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| recommendations from Daniel from each criteria and not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| wordsmithing just so we can get through the selection criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| because each Daniel has recommendations for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| So how does the board feel on either voting to adopt Daniel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| recommendations or should we just look at the substance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| each criteria versus the wordsmith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| I think we can do both pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| I mean it's not going to take any longer to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Are we going to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| We're going to vote on each one as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| That is what the board chooses to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Somebody can make a motion to adopt that one and second and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| can vote on that individually if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| May I add something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| Is there of the 10 that's listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| Do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Does anyone have a problem with any of 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Would you like to remove one of the 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| Is there something that you don't like of the 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| I would like to remove number two because the wisdom to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| when change is necessary isn't measurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| So I think it's best to if something we want to remove if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| we make a motion to remove it and then we can vote as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| How does that sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| I think that's going to move it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| So why would you want to want to remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| Because how would you measure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| How do you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| How can you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| How can you say that someone has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| How do you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Does everything have to be measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Well how do they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| How did they show us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| So we're going to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| We need to make a motion to remove it and then have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| discussion about removing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| So are you making a motion to read to remove item T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Remove motion to remove item two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| And do we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| So that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| So no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| No second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| So that fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| Are there any others that anybody wants to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Let's maybe start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Can we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| I agree with what Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Miss Satterfield I think was going and that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| And also Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Grissom mentioned it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| So the first one is about being a good listener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| The second one is about being a change agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Like can we just go through the 10 and pull out the core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| concept and say do we like this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| Because I don't want us to get hung up in the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| I mean the reason I brought wording is because Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Satterfield emailed the board ahead of the meeting and asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| So I did what was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| And you know we changed the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| But there is some substance to each of these 10 things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| And I think if we can just highlight what the core concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| is and saying yay or nay that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| So Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| Grissom would you be so kind as to go through the 10 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| just say what that basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| And they're already are like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| If you'll go to page 29 to the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| We just simply added to what's listed on the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| If you go with what's just listed on the chart the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| that came out number one ability to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| You just want to say ability to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| That is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| I'm just telling you on these things people are just if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| you're applying for Knox County schools you're going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| down through here and go OK listen I do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| They're not going to look at the wordsmithing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| So what you are asking for is already done on page 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| If we just take the top 10 which that's what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| I just added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| That's ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| You know number one if your ability to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Number two was ability to initiate and adapt to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| Number three ability to generate support from community groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2788)|

| 0:46:33| Effective communication both oral and written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Successful classroom teaching experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Exhibit strong interpersonal communication skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Number seven was goal oriented committed to long range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Number eight exhibit strong analytical and problem solving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Number nine ability to work with and generate support from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| community groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Number nine ability to work with and generate support from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| entire board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| And number 10 demonstrate sensitivity toward cultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| And guys I think you really when we get into the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| interview process we're going to develop some sample questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| for you all that are going to be directly tied to the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| That's where you're going to get into the things of dressing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| you know when you're interviewing a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Tell us what you've done to make change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| How did you involve others when you made that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| You know we're going to help you with those questions to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| But for the criteria I think if you just use the words on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| 29 we will be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| This one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| I mean is it too simplistic just to use these instead of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| a sentence because I'm a bullet point person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| I mean I think in our society like bullet points are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| So this communicates clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Would y'all be opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| Using this criteria just as it's listed on page 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| So are you making a motion to make a motion to use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| Let me finish my motion Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| McMillan and then you can second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| I make a motion that's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| I make a motion to use the criteria as listed on page 29 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| the in the verbiage the way it is listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| Is that clear enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| So we have a motion by Miss Horn to use the top 10 of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| criteria listed on page 29 and as is in a second by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| So is there any discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Miss Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| I do think that in today's world people just want to especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| if they're looking at it for the first time they just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| go down through there and see what's expected what our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| And I think like Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Grissom said there's time for the other later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| But I mean it would also help with this bad wanting it done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| a platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I mean this is a whole section and a half that could have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| enunciated with things very simplistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| So I'm not opposed to it and I kind of like the idea actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| for reference point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Miss Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I mean it may be that when Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| Grissom goes back and looks at this it may be that the order of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| something may need to be tweaked a little bit just so that like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| thoughts are together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| I mean kind of just quickly looking at it it may not be but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| would anybody be opposed to if she sees something that needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| be tweaked just with an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Is anybody bothered by that because I I think I'll just list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| them as order because they're in rank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| I mean so that they're ranked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Yeah they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Number one item number eight got the overall ranking is number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| So that's how I list them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| So I'm not opposed to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| The reason I wouldn't support it is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| And Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Grissom tell me if this is what your intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| I recognize that those that list came from that chart and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| recognize that you put them in priority priority order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| But I also recognize that some of the additional language that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| you added was reflective of other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| And so if we if we only use the words in that chart then what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| we're saying is that's the only tool we're basing our criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| And Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Grissom I thought did a good job at a layup elaborating on some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| of those other community feedback and comments in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| And none of these are on three lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| I appreciate bullet points to none of these are complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| I just I would want our criteria to be a more a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| reflective and true to the overall comments that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| in our community meetings because I think we invested time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| and energy in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| And we had one public forum speaker that referenced the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| NAACP letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| This particular wording helps bring all of that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| Again I don't care if we wordsmith this and change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| actual wordings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| But to me the benefit of adding a little bit more to it was you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| brought in other thoughts and ideas beyond just those hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| criteria that were developed out of that one particular tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| And can I add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| I think that it's important if I am applying for your job I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| going to go look and read this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| And so I suggest that to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| If you you're going to put it on your Web site and we'll say to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| interested candidates you need to read the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| And so that that's another way they're going to see what each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| group said and get all comments by reading that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| And if I were the potential applicant I would want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| that what the board approved as the criteria is reflective of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| lot of what I'm seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| And I think if we strip out some of that content I think I might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| question as an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| I wonder how much they really listened to their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| I'm not saying that's our intent in doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| I know we're just trying to get the word shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| I just would appreciate us having an opportunity to involve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| more of those thoughts and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Do you have something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| I just wanted to ask a point of clarification for the for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| board's assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Miss Horne your your motion for page 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| Is it to include all of the criteria preference rankings or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| just those one through 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Just one through 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| I'm sorry I was not specific that the highlighted the top 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| are the highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| So I can make an amended motion if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3180)|
| 0:53:08| I think I said the top 10 when I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| But I don't know if that was what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Miss Coney do you mind reading what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3193)|
| 0:53:21| And I believe your motion Miss Horne was to use the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| as listed on page 29 in the verbiage the way it is listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| and then Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| McMillan seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| So I would like to amend my motion to note that it is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| highlighted items on page 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| Top 10 the top 10 one through 10 which are highlighted on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| So Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| So we have a motion and a second to an amended motion to adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| the top 10 as they are written on page 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| So more discussion on that Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| And I have to say I kind of go back for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| I got Miss Horne's things when I read these I like the short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| quick whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| But when I was reading the highlighted top 10 one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| things I was noticing missing was anything about development of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| staff which I think is so important in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| However if you look at number six in here it says has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| ability to unify as diverse groups builds and maintains a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| diverse staff with high morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| But if you just look at number six over here it doesn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| And so that that's where I kind of got what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| And then when I started really reading it listening to him I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| think we're missing some stuff when we just go by the bullets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| because I do think these how they've done it in here is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| was one of my big things is I like gosh if we just go by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| highlighted bullets like we're not talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| I think that's a huge job for our superintendent to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| our staff bring morale and our staff you know and I totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| don't see that in the 10 kind of highlighted on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| I mean I think it's a lot of comments and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| So that's where I probably would not then support it after I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| thought about it a little bit more and I probably like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| more in a little bit more in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| I'm not saying exactly this wording but a little bit better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| descriptors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Miss Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Did you have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| I appreciate board member Babb for bringing that perspective up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| because I did kind of change my perspective of what I said what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| the direction that I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| But because I was leaning more to the report will be listed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| the Web site and where we live and so any can't if we did agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| to go through the just what the criteria says on page 29| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| somebody applying for this role should do their due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| to be able to then speak in the interview to say this is how I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| I build maintain diverse you know in that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| However I do understand it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| It does give more information out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| So that changed my perspective when you shared that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| You know I think that's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Miss Babb because that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| That's not in here in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| So it may be that we could add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| I mean I'm not opposed to adding you know that to that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| So just kind of wanted to say that out there because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| definitely see your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| And I mean I'm really fine either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| I really you know it's fine to me either way we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| So can I make an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| So we all agree that on page 29 we agree to the top 10 in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| I just elaborated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| So if you're good with the top 10 on page 29 another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| But what I'm saying is those were the core concepts you agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| to in the brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| We just elaborated it and expanded on those concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| So what I'm hearing is you're probably OK with the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| that's listed in the brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Some of you may want to tweak a sentence or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| Once we get through the language I want to make a motion to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| a change to one of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| So I don't know that I won't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| But I want to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| I've got a motion that motion on the floor that we'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| move forward with first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Do you have more discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| I agree with Miss Satterfield's comments about the report being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| I think these things serve a slightly two different purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| In my mind the report is a collection of data that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| gathered about what our community values and a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| This brochure is a codification of that saying this is what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| board is expecting from the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| And so if I just have this report as a potential applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| all I would see is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Here's a lot of what this community thinks they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| I don't necessarily from this report alone have any sense of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| what the board who's going to be my employer actually wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| And so to me they serve two different functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| Both are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| And so I think we need to make sure that whatever is in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| brochure is us feeling really firm that this is what we as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| board want in this and that we're not relying on somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| just looking at this to try to get some sense of what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| We need to tell them very clearly what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| So anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| Miss Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| I didn't realize my thing was still on but I think that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3538)|
| 0:58:59| And so I definitely think it's important that we look through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| these and make sure that that these are our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| I think that's a really good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| And I'm really I'm fine with I'm really fine either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| I mean as far as whether we list these as bullet points because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| Miss Babbitt we do leave out a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| So I think that's a very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| So unless we're unless there's anybody that feels strongly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| this I'm willing to withdraw my motion so that we just go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| to looking at the how it's printed here and go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3568)|
| 0:59:35| I need Mr. McMillan's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| Mr. Duplo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Do I need Mr. McMillan to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| So I would draw my motion and let's just go back to discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| We'll turn it back over to the better bill to say I make up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| I make a motion that we adopt Daniel what board member Daniel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| Watson's recommendations for the wording of the search the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| selection criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| So we have a motion by Miss Satterfield to adopt the Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| Watson's changes to the wording in the selection criteria in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| second by Miss Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| Is there any discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| I would offer a friendly amendment that for the purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| of tonight we adopt this wording but we also allow somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| to copy edit it and to just make sure the grammar is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| So let me make sure I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| We we would according to your motion we would adopt all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3644)|
| 1:00:51| language in these 10 things that Daniel is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3651)|
| 1:01:03| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| So we have that motion by Miss Satterfield a second by Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| And Mr. Watson are you wanting to make a friendly amendment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| Yes just a friendly amendment that we would after approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| that the board would be comfortable letting a copy editor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| address any grammatical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Miss Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| We're discussing only the criteria the selected 10 criteria at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| So Miss Coatney could you read the motion that's on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3704)|

| 1:01:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| So Miss Satterfield made a motion to adopt Mr. Watson selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| criteria from the edited wording and the friendly amendment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3711)|

| 1:02:00| And it was seconded by Miss Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| So any more discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| Several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3733)|

| 1:02:31| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Miss Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| That's eight yes votes and one no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| So that motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| So Miss Satterfield if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| So I like to make a motion that we for criteria for criteria five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3759)|
| 1:02:59| where it is says experience as a teacher who understands the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3779)|

| 1:03:08| the instruction curriculum and educational program that meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| needs of diverse student bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| I would like to make the motion that we change teacher to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| kind of doesn't difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| Maybe I just won't use language here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| I would like to make a motion that we have a we have a criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| that we have successful experience as a director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3810)|

| 1:03:38| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Or replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| I want to replace because this criteria for five is specifically for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| successful classroom teaching experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| And when we were talking with Susan's recommendation that's how I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| formed the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| But now that we're back to the language I don't know where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| where it just says teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| So I would say and recommend experienced teacher as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| experience and director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| So as well as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| So not additional criteria but as well as experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| So how are we worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| My point is successful experience as a director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| I make the motion that we add in the criteria within the 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| criteria that successful experience as director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| So when you add that to the criteria I'm only looking now at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| candidates that have our superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| So that may you may want to make that a minimum then that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| if your minimum is that you're going to require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| It might not want to be a criteria you might want it to be a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| qualification that you must have successful superintendent experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3887)|
| 1:04:55| Did we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3895)|
| 1:05:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| So Miss Satterfield has made that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Do we have a second to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| Can we clarify the motion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| So yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Would you like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Is the word teacher in or out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| No the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| I would leave that one as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| I think you move it to the minimum add a number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Lord have mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| Can I second and make a friendly amendment at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| You can help clarify the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Look my goal is to put in experience director to make a friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| So in the paragraph that I'm suggesting that we strike under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| position the director of schools that part that's from our policy my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| friendly amendment would be that we would add a minimum qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| of a master degree and that either a minimum and also a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| qualification of prior superintendent experience or another way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| depending on how we feel about it is to say that prior superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| experience is preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| So I would defer to you miss Satterfield to determine if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| it to be preferred or required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| But I would put it in the position statement along with a master's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| So what Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| Grissom was saying for putting it under the minimum qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| So would you like to clarify that that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| So how actually how we actually read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| So my my friendly amendment to your motion would be in place of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| paragraph that says the director of school shall be a person dot dot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| dot is to say that the minimum requirements is that the super and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| that the candidate have a master's degree and either a preferred prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| experience as a superintendent or a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| And I'm leaving that up to you to decide if you'd like to recommend a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| minimum or preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4028)|
| 1:07:17| I accept the I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4037)|
| 1:07:31| I accept the friendly motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Can we have more discussion on deciding preferred or minimum chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4054)|
| 1:07:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| Before she.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| You can make a motion that you're going to use either preferred or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4065)|
| 1:07:56| minimum and then and then discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| Discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| I accept the friendly emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| The friendly amendment to the motion of using either preferred or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| minimum of super director schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| So just to clarify, we have moved on from the selection criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| Suddenly that's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| So we have adopted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| So now we are working on the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| And in this Satterfield with has made the motion and a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| by Mr. Watson to add the minimum qualification of a master degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4106)|
| 1:08:33| And we are discussing whether we want preferred or required past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4113)|
| 1:08:41| experience as a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| So discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| I do not know who was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| Miss Bowne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Start on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| I think they were all first, but I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| And I would like Dr. Grissom's opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| I would prefer to say preferred so that we don't eliminate somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| right out of the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| I'm okay with minimum, but I don't know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| Dr. Grissom, if you from your prior work with superintendent searches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| still like that one wording is better than another, would it eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| a great number to have a minimum and how do we determine that minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| or would it be better to just say preferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| Are we talking about just the superintendent's experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Adding the director having experience as director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| There's a big difference between saying superintendent experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| required and preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Preferred leaves it open for ones that don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| When you say superintendent required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| if I've got 100 candidates and only two have superintendent experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| I'm only looking at two when you say required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| I would think further into the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| If we said preferred, and I think we had the hours and hours of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| before about preferred masters or preferred doctorate or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| So I really like the preferred better because I think further into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| those candidates will separate themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| and I think we'll be able to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| I understand the importance with a system as large as ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| to have experience as a director of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| but I think preferred leaves us open to that, but it doesn't limit us to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| and I'm afraid when we start trying to put minimum requirements on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| that it's going to narrow our search in the beginning rather than the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4241)|
| 1:10:48| and I'd rather see it narrowed at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| That's my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| A majority of the boards have in their policy the minimum qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| of a master's degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| That's pretty common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| Now, a different point is the superintendent experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| I've not done any searches lately that have said superintendent experience required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| It's not to say you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| I'm just telling you that if you have superintendent experience required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| that's the first thing our screening committee, we're going to just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| if you don't have it, we'll set you aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| They won't even be considered because that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| Can I just ask a quick question in regards to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| So when you do say superintendent required, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| you might get applications from superintendents of districts that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| only have two or three schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| I guess what you're saying is disqualify someone who might be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| in central office or in a leadership role in a system that has 150 schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4313)|
| 1:12:01| which is a big difference, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| So I see what you're saying with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| I think when you say superintendent experience, if you say preferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| it's going to be, say I got down to this stack of candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| and they were all pretty equal on everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| but three of them have superintendent experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| I'm going to pick them because you said preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| So you're going to, they're going to rise to the top if they've got, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| if I'm trying to narrow it down to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| So I could be wrong in saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| but I just want us to note if we make it required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| that probably will prevent any current staff member at Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| from applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| I don't know that we have any other staff members in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| who have prior superintendent experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Don't hear me saying I'm going to default to hiring somebody from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| That's not what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| but I'm saying if we want to be open to looking at internal candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| if we say prior superintendent experience, again, I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| I don't know the histories of all of our staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| but I don't think any other current staff members have prior superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| I just want to point that out there for the board to take into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| consideration when they decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| Ms. Bass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| Yeah, I don't support required because I sort of look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| We just look even around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| There are some tiny little counties that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| we have principals that have more responsibility than those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| superintendents do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| And so I think, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| what we're looking at more and where I really look at is people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| coming from diverse backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| I mean, all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| you're knocking out somebody that comes from a big experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| a big system that's got a lot of experience with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| a lot of very diverse people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| and they would be knocked out over somebody from some tiny little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| community just because they have superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| So I do think it's too restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| I don't mind the preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| You know, I think obviously we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| we've got to have somebody with experience coming in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| We've got to have somebody really highly qualified coming in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| but I think the required is going to be too restrictive and could cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| some good people out and might make somebody rise to the top that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| really isn't fitting what we want just because of that one word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4459)|
| 1:14:27| Ms. Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| I could not support required either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| I would want to support preferred because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| basically because of all the comments that everybody's already said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| I was just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| I don't think that we've ever had anybody that was a superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4483)|
| 1:14:53| prior to being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Now, they may have been an assistant at a big system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| but that goes all the way back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Since I'm so old, I go all the way back to Mildred Dole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| And, you know, she was superintendent for something like 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| And I don't remember whether she was appointed by the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| or, I mean, quarterly court in that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| or whether she was straight out elected as far as the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| But since then, to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| the others have always been assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| Would you care to comment on that, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| You're pretty much right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| I think Dr. Lindsey might have been the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Oh, I forgot about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| I forgot about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| So do you want to accept his amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| or are we talking about the language of required versus preferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| You can restate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Yeah, I was going to restate the amendment with my changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| that I will accept from my amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Is that cool with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| Yeah, I'm going to tell my own changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| I make the motion that we add to the criteria minimum qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| of a master's degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| and a previous director of school experience is preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4585)|
| 1:16:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| So is preferred versus required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4597)|
| 1:16:47| So we're adopting the preferred, not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| And that's not going under criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| Want me to reiterate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| So I make the motion that we adopt the minimum qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| of a master's degree and director of schools preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4621)|
| 1:17:08| From a point of order, I think I made the original second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| so do I need to be the one to second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| I second that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| Mr. Chen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| Just for ease of understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| would it be possible to add preferred before that to make it easier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| What's the word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| May I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| I think we just need to make it simple under the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| We're just going to say master's degree required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| superintendent experience preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| I make the motion that under the position we say master's degree required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4668)|
| 1:17:54| superintendent experience preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| And Mr. Watson, your second is good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| So Ms. Coatney, will you restate the motion so we can just to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| everyone's clear on what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| Mr. Drinkwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Should we just, since we're working so much on clarity here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| should we put preferred but not required just to be sure that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4701)|
| 1:18:29| understands it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4709)|
| 1:18:41| Ms. Coatney will restate this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| The motion is to list under the position that a master's degree is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| and that superintendent experience is preferred but not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| Is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4752)|
| 1:19:19| And I want to lift up, I did move us to the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| and when we were still on selection criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| So is there anything from the selection criteria that anybody wants to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| or lift up before we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| We already did it, but I kind of moved us out of it by my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| So I want to come back to that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| I'm not making this in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| I just would say on number two, Daniel, by the way, let's back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| You did a really good job and I don't see a lot of changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| just it flows and the words are better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| But I really don't like, even in the face of opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| I know what he's trying to say there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| but I just feel like that's such a negative thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| It's number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| I would just like to strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| Do I have to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| We've already approved those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Yeah, you've already approved them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| I just think that's very negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4813)|
| 1:20:31| So moving on to the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| So moving on to the section titled the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| I think Mr. Watson had some proposed changes there that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| Is there a motion to approve that or adopt changes to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| or any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| Madam chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| I wonder if we should look at the system back section first because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| kind of may change what we adopt for the districts section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4868)|
| 1:21:16| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| I mean, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Maybe it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| I was just thinking that we could list, I guess my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| my thought was in saying that we may want to list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| The 9,000 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| Down under system facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| like we may want to take it out of the section that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| Watson has suggested and move it down to system facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| So it may be more beneficial to look at that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| So if I could make a motion to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| The system facts as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| but adding the 9,000 employees and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4916)|
| 1:22:03| And possibly even the third largest employer, but we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| we could talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| Can I ask a clarifying question before we ask for a second is download.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| If that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| So this horn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| the only reason why remove the system facts is because all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| except for the teacher number is already described in the description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| in the district description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| I just didn't think we needed to repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| So like the, the budget number is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| It's like it's twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| So I'm good with either section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| We put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| I just don't know that we need to take the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| And list those facts twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| Once in paragraph form and once in a bulleted list form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| So my only intent was to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| since they're already in the paragraph is let's use that space for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| something we didn't get to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| Like the student demographics, all my only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| my main suggestion is we don't put it in two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| I just think that's a waste of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| And it wasn't in two places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| but some folks had sent me some changes and I put in the changes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| edits and that's how you get multiple when people are sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| So the version we got though, did it in two places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| But I can say we, we can add both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| If we're any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| we can include the system facts and the student demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| And then, and if you want to take it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| I don't think it hurts to leave it in that paragraph form as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| but just don't think you have to, we've got space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| We'll make it work to put all that in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| So it may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| it may even be better to refine the district piece a little bit and just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| and leave the system facts and maybe even add the demographics as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| as you have here, you know, maybe that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| It's just kind of I think maybe what we ought to do is kind of decide what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| we want and then let,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| let Tammy format it so that it includes all the information that we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| see in there. Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| So are you in your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| Are you making a motion to add the student demographics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| Yeah, I think that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| but not specifically saying where to add them as long as they're in here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| only in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| I guess my motion would be to leave the system facts in a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| in a bullet point format as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| and then add the demographics that Mr. Watson has noted with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| with the correct demographics that we currently have. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| So do we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5073)|
| 1:24:40| Because we talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| we talk about the teachers and I just think it wouldn't be bad to put the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| demographic just two of our whole staff. I mean, I think it is kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| I mean we bring it up that we're a major employer, but I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| I think the teacher and I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| whether it's just one fact of that we've got this much staff or breaking it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| out, teachers and definitely unclassified. Cause I mean, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| I think it is kind of, it's a huge job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| Yes. I think it's all just depending on where we're formatting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| Like that's where I'm trying to look at too many different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| But I think in his new one, he's got it in the paragraph form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| whether it's in paragraph or bullets. Once again, I'm a bullet person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| As far as like numbers and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| I do think it's easier to read kind of where she's got it down as system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| facts. To me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| that's so much easier to read it there than when you've got it in paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| form. So I do, I personally like that. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| I just think it's an easier read as far as the bullets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| Okay. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| I agree with that. If I think listing those system facts as a bulleted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| uh, in the bulleted format is much easier to consume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| And that little bit of paragraph space we would lose by removing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| I wouldn't, again, I wouldn't keep them in both places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| I just don't think you need them is use that description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| that district description to be a little bit more inspirational,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| maybe elaborate more on our, um, on our, uh, strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| So like student achievement and creating a positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| positive culture was left off. I added it back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| but we could take that district description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| the few words that we'll lose by removing those system facts and just in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| within it, bullet pointing are the three areas of our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| So, so again, you had the district description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| remove the system facts that are already duplicated in the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| add the one about 9,000 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| cause it doesn't exist there already in the system facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| And then, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| use that safe space to elaborate a little bit on the strategic plan through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| some bullet points along with the student demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| Thank you. Um, I just, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| right. I'll second your motion. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| Thank you. And so my question, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| I don't know how system facts is like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| I feel like it's system facts and districts is the same thing. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| and so I think that system facts and I understand the bullet point and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| think that can be fine, but system facts out from when I'm reading this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| it feels like I'm reading, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| what is the district if it's not the system facts that's there. So I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| I support that. And I would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| so moving system facts all into under district and however that format looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| like. And then I would also like to see, um, the demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| So instead of system fact bullet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| maybe that just be demographics of our school system and that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| teachers and students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| but what's under the system facts now is describing the district in my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| Ms. Horn. Thank you, Madam chair. Okay. Maybe what we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| what if we did this? What if we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| what if we have Knox County schools as a diverse school system with urban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| suburban and rural schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| then have the paragraph Knox County schools or we are, whatever you want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| is committed to providing all students that paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| And we could add if there are pieces of the strategic plan that are missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| you could add it to that paragraph and then list all of the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| together so that you, you know, you're going to add the, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| I definitely want to make sure we add all of the employees like Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| Babs said, um, and whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5309)|
| 1:28:36| whatever else may be missing that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Watson had noted that have all of that under, under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| under system facts so that we have a paragraph and then the bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5321)|
| 1:28:48| That's kind of what sounds like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| sounds like maybe would be more efficient and get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| get kind of everything that we want. Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| I really liked that suggestion by Mrs. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| I think that would make it cohesive. I think it would flow well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| And I really liked Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Watson suggestion to highlight a little bit more of the strategic plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| didn't notice student achievement wasn't in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| So thank you for putting that in. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| so I really liked both of those suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| Ms. Satterfield, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| Okay. So we have a motion by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| Can you restate that motion? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| We might need clarification or can I just do a new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| a new one based on what we've talked about? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| So I think I would make that I would amend my motion to read Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| schools is a diverse school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| with urban, suburban and rural schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| Then including the paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| adding the piece about student achievement and then to system facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| we would want to make sure we list 9,000 employees and we can break out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| teacher piece. If, if you, if, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| the board would like to also listing in that system facts bullet point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| section that were the third largest district in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| and the strategic plan stuff. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| And making sure the strategic plan information is included with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| paragraph, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| And who's going to decide what that is? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| So we could use Mr. Watson's language where he's added those two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| So in Mr. Watson's document under the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| it's in that third paragraph. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| So taking Mr. Watson's third paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| Can you restate it one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| Ms. Coatney, did you get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| Do you want to restate what you have or do you want me to say it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| I'm happy to do either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| So to keep the paragraph that Knox County schools is a diverse school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| system, including urban, suburban and rural schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| and then adding the language from the strategic plan to hit the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| highlights of that and to list the facts and demographics to include the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| third largest district in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| And also if you could reflect in the motion regarding the strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5491)|
| 1:31:39| plan information that we're going to use Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| Watson's language from his document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| And then also I believe I said that let's include all our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5505)|
| 1:31:52| So 9,000 with over 9,000 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| And the student demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| And also adding the student demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| Not as written though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| Not as written, but the current updated student demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| I think that's everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| Did you get that Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| So do we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| So we have a motion by Ms. Horn, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| And again, for clarification, Ms. Coatney, if you will read that back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5545)|
| 1:32:38| So the motion is to keep paragraph one under the district section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| but to add that is included urban, suburban and rural schools to use Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5563)|
| 1:32:49| Watson's second paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| which highlights the strategic plan bullet points to include all of the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5573)|
| 1:33:02| and student demographics that are listed in to include the third largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| district in Tennessee that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| that we have over 9,000 employees and to also make sure the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| demographics are up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| So we have a motion by Ms. Horn and a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| Turn to the back and look at the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5612)|
| 1:33:41| So Mr. Watson discussion on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| Ms. Satterfield, I believe in an email that you sent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| You said the chamber was working on a new description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| For the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| Well, the only reason I ask is because I would make a motion that we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| approve with whatever they come with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| A little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| I'll just bring up a little bit was in reaction to we got the first brochure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| and it was a different description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| And that's when we were going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| I was going to be with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| And then we got this and this seemed a more accurate description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| I did get a brief little synopsis and I'm happy to share it and I can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| I didn't have as much problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| The first one we got was about Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| I mean, as much as I like Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| I think I think it was just it was a brief thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| So I think that's where we were like, OK, we're getting a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| But then we received this and it was edited and I felt like this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| a better description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| So I think that's a little bit of the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| I didn't even look at the first one because the second one came so close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| So I didn't realize it had already been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| So any more discussion on the section titled community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| Would anyone like to make a motion to adopt this section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| So a motion by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5707)|

| 1:35:13| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| Second by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5715)|

| 1:35:32| Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| Did you say that just for questioning, will we be removing the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Well, we ask for folks if they're coming, if they've got principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| endorsements, we'd like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| If they're coming from another state, what they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| So, no, this is really for our office, the application process, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| everything will be coming through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| And this is what we typically we ask this of all of our searches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| So really, the application process is really for our office purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| Well, I need more clarification a little bit, because if I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| candidate, so this will not be on the brochure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| So if I'm a candidate and I see this and I don't have a license, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| will be discouraged to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| But we don't need it for the state of Tennessee, given that it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| the bachelor's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| No, we're just saying if you have endorsements or certificates or in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| any other state licenses, share them with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| But we can take that out if you don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| I'm just trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| When I read this, I read that I need qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| It's no problem to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| I think if we want to, if they do have it, if we want to see it, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| think we can say, if you have any certificates or your license, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| submit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| And I get what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| The way it currently reads, it looks like it's kind of a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| But it does seem like if they have them, we want them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5817)|
| 1:37:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| You want to leave it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| We're going to research the folks anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| Ms. Satterfield, are you making a motion to Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| Can I just have some clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| So, basically, on number three, it says a copy of the candidate's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| Tennessee or other state's license and certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| So, basically, you're asking that they submit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| It'll be their teacher license or their professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| There's not a superintendent license per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| But, I mean, that's something that you're going to have to verify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| anyway to make sure that they meet our requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| How about if we change it to professional, any professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| licenses or certificates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| Submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| And I think that way it doesn't get into the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| And anything that they have that is a professional license or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| certificate, we're asking them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| I think that's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| I think they should submit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| And I think that's just a more general and doesn't get into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| confusion over our state stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| I think that's a great suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| So, are you making a motion to change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| I'll make a motion to say submit a copy of any professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| certificates, licenses, or endorsements, whatever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| phrases are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Yeah, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| Any applicable licenses, certificates, endorsements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5906)|
| 1:38:33| I don't know what the other educational type things are that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| So, we have, under the application process, a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5922)|
| 1:38:49| Ms. Babb to change number three to a copy of any applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| certificates or professional certificates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| Professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Help us with the wording here, Dr. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| I think she said any applicable professional licenses or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| And I don't know if endorsements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| I don't know what all the correct thing is for educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| That will cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| But I do want to bring up, because this is where I brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| up that last paragraph, or the second to last paragraph, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| it just says board, and I just want some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| I just think we ought to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Do we want to vote on this one first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Well, that's why I didn't know if we wanted to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| everything in this section or if we wanted to divide it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| Go ahead, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| Yeah, I just, in that paragraph, I think at least one time in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| front of the board, it just needs to say Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| just as a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| Yeah, I made that note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| So, I didn't know if we needed to vote on it at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| I would like to add additional language at the bottom where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| says Knox County Schools is an equal opportunity employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| I would also like to add candidates from groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| traditionally underrepresented in public schools leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| are encouraged to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| And it was an and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| You can do the grammar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6008)|

| 1:40:16| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| Is this a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6017)|

| 1:40:56| I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6058)|
| 1:40:58| So my wording, candidates from groups traditionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| underrepresented in public school leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| are encouraged to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| Is there clear wording from, is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| My only comment to Ms. Satterfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| would be, I think because you're adding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| this is why we don't want to put required superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| Because I think you're really trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| to have a wide net of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| And I think that's where preferred is a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| So we have a motion on the floor by Ms. Babb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| And Ms. Coatney, if you will be kind enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| to restate those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| So the motion is to change bullet point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| three under the application process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| to submit copies of any applicable professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| licenses or certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| To clarify that the board referred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| to in the first paragraph under the bullet points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| would include that this is the Knox County Board of Education's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| And then to also include the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| under Knox County Schools is an equal opportunity employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| that candidates from traditionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| underrepresented groups in public school leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| positions are encouraged to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6158)|
| 1:42:38| I think that concludes the review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| of the brochure and the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| Yeah, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| OK, so then let me stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6169)|
| 1:42:49| So our next, what's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| Only thing left is if you want to is page four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| if you want to decide on the procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| or if you want to talk about that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| No, we need to talk about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| Let's talk about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| Let's move to page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| So page four on procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| I know the biggest thing that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| was changing the three candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| So I make the motion that we open up recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| for the procedures with the first one being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| refer up to five candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6208)|
| 1:43:28| So a motion by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| Page four, item one, change three to five candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| Up to five candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| Up to five candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| And a seconded by Ms. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| Are we going to do this one at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6229)|
| 1:43:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Just a question about that, Dr. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| So if we change that to five candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| that we would want you to refer to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| so then can you walk us through what the process would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| Would we then look at the five candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| and decide if we want to interview all five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| Or would we be saying we want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| and if you have five you're recommending to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| that we would interview all five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| It's typically when you've hired us to screen and recommend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| you're going to interview those five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| But you can do what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| I'm just doing the legwork for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| But typically how our process works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| you hired us to screen, to narrow the candidates down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| So you've asked us to bring up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| And that would mean you would interview those five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| Can we just have some conversation around what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| you know, the reason for three versus five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| Can I make a, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| So Ms. Horne, I just want to make a clarifying statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| And Dr. Grissom, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| The second sentence in that says the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| may accept or reject any of the candidates recommended by TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| So that could happen prior to interview, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| We could get that list of five and say, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| don't want to interview that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| And so the reason I like the idea of five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| is I think it opens us up to more possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| And I still think there's flexibility in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| to not be forced to interview five if we don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| Well, you asked me what typically happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| Just most all of our searches, if you ask for five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| or if you ask for three, the board will interview those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| Have boards in the past, I brought them five and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| say, oh, we don't want to interview this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| Very rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| But you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6346)|
| 1:45:46| I mean, it's your decision what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| I just don't think you ought to get into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| if we're going to choose this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| and we tell everybody you're going to go through TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| they're going to screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| It's just when I bring you the five, then if somebody says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| oh, I want to add John Doe, and then somebody up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| says, I want to add, then you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| to get up to six or seven, eight candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| So I think that's why we put no new names may be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| You know, you agree up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| This is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| Any interested candidate applies through TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| OK, so well, just for some clarity, Mr. Duport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6385)|
| 1:46:32| we have had this discussion at past board meetings about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| If you could weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| I have a question for Dr. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| On the last sentence on number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| says new names may not be submitted by board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| Dr. Grissom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6408)|
| 1:46:49| So by that sentence, are you saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| let's say that TSBA provides the top five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| and the board members don't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| But let's say a board member wants to bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| number six on your list, and there's a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| and the board eventually votes to bring up number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| Are you saying that that's not allowed at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| We're talking about new names, folks that didn't even apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| I'm going to hand over all applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| That night, I bring you the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| If there's 50, I'm going to hand you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| the board chairman off 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| I'm saying no new names above that 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| You just can't say, oh, so and so, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| heard from Arkansas would be great, I want to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| I was hoping you would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| So I mean, we just need to make that clear in the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| that that's exactly what you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| So Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| Timmy, I think I'm the one that brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| the five in one of our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| because when we were just saying three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| I felt like if, say, they were, I always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| feel like in anything, there's usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| kind of a natural cutoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| And I just was thinking, if there are, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| four that are just superstars, I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| want y'all to be the ones that cut somebody out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| because we had decided on three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| And that's where I was like, that's where I sort of was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| troubled with, and like the five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| not necessarily that I think there need to be five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| but if there is a natural cutoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| and it is three that are great, then let's take the top three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| But if the cutoff is really that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| are four that seem to rise to the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| and so I don't know how to convey that to y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| And that was my intent, was not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| to say that we definitely have to have five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| but it could be up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| And I will say this, I will not bring you five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| if I don't feel good about five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| If we only feel good about three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| we're going to bring you three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| We may feel good about four, or we may only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| feel good about two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| I just didn't want to limit it by the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| and there might have to be, y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| have to choose to cut somebody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| I think the language, up to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| is good, that that gives me the not feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| like, I don't want to waste your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| and I don't want to waste a candidate's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| I don't want to interview five just for the sake of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| Miss Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| For clarification, if TSBA brought us three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| and there was still someone in that original list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| we could vote as a board to bring them back, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| Miss Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| And I was just thinking about, the board may accept or reject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| any of the candidates recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| I think we just have to remember that we do all this in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| So we have to be very mindful of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| I just want to go on record, if TSBA recommends candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| to us, I feel like we need to be prepared to interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| all of those candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Because I just think that's the fair thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| So would you agree, Dr. Grissom, with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6596)|
| 1:50:03| It makes me nervous to have a list of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| you give us a list of five, and we look at their resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| and we decide to knock one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| And we've done that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| That would bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6613)|
| 1:50:19| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| So we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| Miss Coatney, do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| The motion is to, for bullet point number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| under the procedures for TSBA, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| refer to up to five candidates for the board consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| And Mr. Dupler, is there, do we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| to change the wording to that second or third sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| in that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| Or are you good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| I would just perhaps suggest, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| where it says new names, perhaps insert their new names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| outside of the applicant pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6658)|
| 1:51:05| So does anyone want to take Mr. Dupler's suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| and make a friendly amendment to, or did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| I'll accept that friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| And Mr. Watson, you seconded that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| OK, Miss Coatney, if you will read that one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| So the motion is to include under bullet point number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| in procedures that TSBA will refer up to five candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| to the board for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| The board may accept or reject any of the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| recommended by TSBA, and new names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| outside of the applicant pool may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| be submitted by board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| So all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| And are there any other changes or any more discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| on procedures on page four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| I don't know who was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| OK, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| Dr. Grissom, before we get into any more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| of this list of procedures, can you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| give us a high level overview and talk about intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| and how this process is supposed to flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| I don't want to get into too many more details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| without getting the sense of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| you're trying to accomplish with the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| and how it should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| Once we get this brochure revised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| I'm assuming you want me to send it back to all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| all to the board for review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| We'll get that redesigned and laid out, sent back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| Once the board approves, we will send out the vacancy brochure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| to the various groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| It goes to a part of a national association of searchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| that includes all the states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| And we'll send it out through that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| We send it to current superintendents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| We send it to the TALS organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| We send it to the AIMS organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| We have a prospective superintendents academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| We'll send it to all those graduates from our academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| We also, this is totally up to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| but we can put it in AASA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| Not sure we get a lot from that, but if you choose to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| we can put it in that magazine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| I'll have to check with them on their deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| Can you say more about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| I'm not familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| American Association of School Administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| It's the national organization, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| for superintendents, principals, and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| And is there a cost to that, I would assume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| Yes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| And so I'll look into that and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| if we can get it in in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| Sometimes their deadlines don't work with our deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| But we're going to ask folks to get their applications turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| in to us by January the 21st to our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| so we'll have time to bring a screening committee together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| to screen all the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| And our job is to find the applicants that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| best meet the criteria that the board's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| And we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| And I will be back here with the finalists on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| back to the timeline, February the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| At that point, I'll present the finalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| This board, we talked about the 15th or the 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| but you all may want to look at that if you're going to do five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| You need to pretty much start looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| at five dates that would be good for you all to interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| We're going to suggest a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| not that you have to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| And I mentioned this in the community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| that each candidate comes and spends a day in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| Each candidate comes, and we'll do a sample schedule for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| They'll meet, much like we did with the community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| schedule, not all of those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| because you don't know where the candidate out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| But let them meet in the morning with central office principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| Let the candidate give a 10 minutes, here's who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| And then let people ask them questions for 50 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| So it's a one hour meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| Then do the same thing, have that same luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| with that group of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| Let the candidates give a 10 minute, here's who I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| 50 minutes for them to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| Afternoon, same thing with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| And then the actual interview with the board will be that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| Obviously, it's in a public setting, so everyone can observe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| We'll also provide you a form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| I think it's good for you to pass out at those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| and at the actual interview, a candidate reaction form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| So if I came to the luncheon and I liked a particular candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| I could make my notes and turn that into you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| just so you can get a feel of what people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| think about each candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| I've found that to be very useful to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| And then the board will have to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| once you decide on the interview dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| then you'll have to come back as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| and look at all your notes and decide and narrow it down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6952)|
| 1:55:58| we say, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| And that's part of the process on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| The process we suggest is you write your top two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| I think we put it under number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| You list your top two choices on a piece of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| and you sign your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| We cannot do secret ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| But every board member, write their top two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| on a piece of paper, sign their name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| turn it in for those to be read aloud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| and that's how you get your top candidate of who you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| to start negotiating with first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| Sometimes you may not work out if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| can't agree with the candidate on your terms or contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| But that's basically the process, abbreviated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| Is there specific parts of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| like, for instance, in number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| where it says the board will determine the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| to be asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| Do we need to go ahead and set out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| a schedule relative to the few board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| we have between now and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| We've obviously seen that this process tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| took a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| I promise you, I will send you all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| Now that I've got the criteria, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| will send you questions in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| so you'll have plenty of time to review them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| You can use them if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| You can add to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| You can make your own questions up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| But we'll provide you questions for each criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| and we'll give that to you well in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| So if we keep our current timetable of the interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| of the 15th through the 17th, or I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| think there was a comment last meeting to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| the 16th through the 18th because of a board member's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| conflict, then we would want to approve those at our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| at least by our regular meeting in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| So is there anything else between now and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| that would need to be approved that we need to be aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| You need to be looking at your superintendent's contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| if you want to make any changes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| I know you have your own board attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| but we've got a general counsel that we've got a sample| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| superintendent contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| It basically gives you everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| but the kitchen sink in it that you can pick and choose things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| But our staff is willing, as part of the service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| if you want us to look at your contract, just email it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| We'll be glad to review it and make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| because we're looking at it from the board's perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| and what's best for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| So if you want to send us your superintendent's contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| we'll be glad for our legal team to review it and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| our suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| But then you need to be deciding on a salary range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| If you're going to keep it the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| that's another item you need to be discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| And at what point would, so at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| we have a brochure and a basic process, at what point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| would a job description enter this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| and when would we need to approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| I would assume that a superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| would want to see a pretty fleshed out job description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| Or maybe is that not typical in this type of search?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7132)|
| 1:58:53| Most boards, the job description is a board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| Most all the policies that boards that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| most boards' policy manuals, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| have their job description is a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| So it typically would not be a separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| Do we have a job description?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| I don't know that you all have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| but it's typically in your job policy manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| So would you recommend in the absence of a policy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| reflects our job description, because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| seems like we don't have one, that we need to create one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| Yeah, we can send you a sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7161)|
| 1:59:21| So that probably would also need to be some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| So given the process, I mean, my assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| would be candidates would want to see that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| before they possibly get interviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| on the 15th through the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| So do we need to try to approve that at our January meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| a job description, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Is that what you would recommend, Dr. Dressen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| in terms of flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| What was the date of your next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| January 5th is the voting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| and our work session is January 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| If I might just add directly to Daniel's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| I think, well, I know the search committee would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| call a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| And so, Terry, if you could find time for all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| to meet before, sometime in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| to where we can discuss superintendent contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| questions, salary range, job description, and whatever else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| So we'll need to do a special call meeting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| Looking at number five in the search process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| will each board member's name be read along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| with their two recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Yes, because you can't have secret ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| So that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| Mr. Dupler, does that take care of open meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7233)|
| 2:00:39| Yes, I mean, as long as it's all brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| to the public in some form or fashion, yeah, that'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| This was my question about the, and it's on number five, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| where we don't rank our top two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| I mean, does it ever happen that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| it's the same two people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| I mean, what happens if, basically, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| everybody puts the same top two, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| not a differentiation if we're not ranking one and two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| You just have to re-vote, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| cast your vote again so you can get a top candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| OK, I just was wondering, I could see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| if we only put one down, but with putting two down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| I was just curious if it could end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| being having the same two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| It could, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| You have to re-vote, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| This is not really part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| Well, I guess it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| So the salary piece, when is that typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| like if there's a superintendent or somebody that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| going to apply to this, when do they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| become concerned about what the salary is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| So what is typical in that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| I kind of need to know now a salary range, because I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| sorry, most people are going to ask you what the salary is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| So I either need to tell them what the current salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| I mean, the salary of the current superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| or you all give me a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| I need one or the other, because that's always a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| And so I've already been talking and recruiting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| So for now, I've just been saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| I take it from the state list what you pay now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| So if you can get me that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| If it's going to be different, it'll be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7340)|
| 2:02:25| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| OK, so do you have more discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| OK, so do we want to address this first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| So we have one change, or two changes, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7356)|
| 2:02:43| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| Since we're talking about salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| you may or may not know this, Dr. Isken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| Do you happen to know what the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| salary of the superintendent in Tennessee is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| Not off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| I think I sent this to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| I sent them all these facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| It's probably Shelby County or Metro superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| I think they may be in the 300s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| But I don't have that off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| But I can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| Well, I just ordered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| Is it Shelby County where the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| is an attorney as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| No, not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| This current superintendent's not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7415)|
| 2:03:42| OK, yes, we voted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| So we talked about the salary document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| Yeah, so the salary document is attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| to the last month's meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| Yes, she sent a separate email called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| superintendent salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| And that is also attached to the documents from November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| So I'll make a motion that we share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| salary range for equivalent district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| size in this region for, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7456)|
| 2:04:25| for the director of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| Is that what you need, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| I'm making the motion to make the range for the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| of our district in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| Yeah, if that's what you all want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| or you want to tell me this is what we pay now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| and that's what you need to relay to interested candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| Or if the board chooses, you may want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| no, we'd like for you to say, here is our range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| So I don't want to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| Can I have a discussion about a motion, Gary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| I just want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| OK, I'm going to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| Do we want to do range or share with the current superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| I mean, that's public information anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| But I mean, it communicates differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| if a superintendent's salary is not what the range is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7506)|
| 2:05:12| And so what are we trying to communicate to our candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7512)|
| 2:05:23| Well, we're still discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| Do I need to read the salaries from these other districts that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| was attached to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| Or do we want to have her share what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| our current superintendent makes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| Where do we want to go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| Ms. Henderson, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| No, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7547)|
| 2:05:49| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7549)|
| 2:05:50| Dr. Grissom, what would be a preferred range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| Like, I'm sure you don't want to have like 100,000 to 400, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| So that's a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Yeah, so what's a sweet spot for the range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| You know, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| In terms of gap between high and low is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| Max, I guess, maybe 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| I don't know, 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7570)|
| 2:06:11| So maybe a $50,000 range in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| So our current pay, at least according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| to the documentation we received from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| I believe it came from Dr. Grissom, is $215,867.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7581)|
| 2:06:27| The highest is Davidson County at $285,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| They have about 81,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| And then the second highest is $230,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| Oh, I thought these were in order by, but they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| So Williamson County is actually the highest at $290,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| It's just at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| I thought it was in salary range order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| Oh, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| It's alphabetical order, and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| thinking it was in salary order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| Yeah, so Shelby at $320,000, Williamson County at $290,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| Davidson at $285,000, Hamilton at $230,000, and Knox at $215,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| So we're the fifth highest right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| And we have the third largest district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7625)|
| 2:07:09| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| Ms. Zeldin, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| I would be very concerned about giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| the range that includes Shelby County and Metro Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7638)|
| 2:07:23| especially if we haven't voted on that salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| Because if we give someone an unrealistic expectation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7652)|
| 2:07:33| Yeah, that's a significant difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| Ms. Satterfield, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| No, that's a, I was going to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| So I guess I'll, Daniel, you, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| I make the motion that we agree to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7666)|
| 2:07:52| the current superintendent's salary as the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| point for superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7676)|
| 2:07:59| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7682)|
| 2:08:02| So we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| and a second by Ms. Henderson to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| the current superintendent's salary with our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| as a data point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| So I'll, more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7697)|
| 2:08:17| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| I was just going to make a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| that we use that number, that hard number that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| but also make it clear that it's negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| I don't want the assumption to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| that this will be the next superintendent's pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| but that's the starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| I'm confused, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| I got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| It's negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| And do you want to tell me what salary it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| Or, you know what, Terri can tell me tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| I'll get that from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| I'm going to agree with us being the fifth lowest right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| I would hate for people to self-select themselves out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| because maybe they're already at a higher salary and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| So I definitely want it to be, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| I definitely agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| I kind of wanted to maybe put a range in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| but if everybody wants to do the point at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| I think it just needs to be very clear that it's negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| I'll make sure to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7752)|
| 2:09:12| Yeah, I think it should be noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| that when we hired Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| he specifically wanted a lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| he was very modest and wanted a lower salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| than what we would have offered had we hired somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| So that's one reason why there's a disparity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7766)|
| 2:09:31| in the number, that ours is so low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| So I think we need to be, I guess I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| a little concerned, I was thinking a range also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| Ms. Babb, because of that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| I'm concerned that if somebody is looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| and there's a low salary that they may not apply, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7786)|
| 2:09:52| Ms. Bounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| Well, I just think negotiable in the way Tammy words it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| will take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| And again, I don't want to set real high expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| and we have to look at the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| And since there's an institutional history there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| we had, some people felt like way overpaid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| our previous superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| especially with his golden balloon parachute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| So as Susan so aptly noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| the superintendent came in at a much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| and I guess you and I negotiated that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| but he was very modest and wanted what was best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| for Knox County and did not want an exorbitant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| But I think if we just put negotiable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| that they will understand that we won't be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7838)|
| 2:10:42| And I'm not gonna print this anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| That's just my verbal when I have conversations with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| Okay, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7847)|
| 2:10:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| And if we'll make sure that we give Dr. Grissom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| the accurate number, because I think 215 is an old number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| I don't think that's the most current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| And it also doesn't include the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| any other expense or travel and other expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| And I think our previous superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| I think was probably around 240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| So, that's quite a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| And that included the salary and travel and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| So let's just make sure that we give you the correct number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7875)|
| 2:11:21| So, Ms. Feltney, will you restate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7886)|
| 2:11:42| So, Ms. Satterfield made a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| that the information to be shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| would be the current salary as a data point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| And with the friendly amendment to make it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| that that number is negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| And that was seconded by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| So we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| and a second by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7924)|
| 2:12:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| So, does that conclude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| Dr. Grissom, is there anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| we need to look at and talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| So we just want to say thank you so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| for taking us through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| Thank you, board members, for sticking through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| and toughening it out tonight to get us on one accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| I appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| But now that we have an adopted criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| we can start recruiting candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| So I want everyone to hear me loud and clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| that Knox County's Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| has not selected our next leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| And that we look forward to receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| a large, diverse pool of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| The next steps in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| we will have a special call meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| to discuss the superintendent contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| questions, salary rank, or we did salary range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7970)|
| 2:12:53| and the job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| So look out for an email for Terry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| to identify the best time for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| And we will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| I think Ms. Babb has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7983)|
| 2:13:05| I wanted to point out, on our schedule right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| we have, we start the interviews on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| And the reason we had talked about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| is actually day, I don't think it's called day on the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| but whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| The Legal and Legislative Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| It's actually the 14th and 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| where we can all spend Valentine's Day together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| in Nashville, and that's sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| But, you know, A, I'm sure y'all are tied up with the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-211208?start=8003)|
