| 0:00:30| Welcome to the Knox County Audit Committee meeting on January 28th, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=30)|
| 0:00:39| Kim, could you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=39)|
| 0:00:44| Jim Morrison. Here. Matthew Warren. Here. Hugh Nystrom. Here. John Schoonmaker. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=44)|
| 0:00:51| Randy Smith. All members are present. Commissioner Schoonmaker, could you lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=51)|
| 0:00:57| us in the Pledge of Allegiance, please, sir? Would everyone please rise and face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=57)|
| 0:01:03| our nation's flag? I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=63)|
| 0:01:11| and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=71)|
| 0:01:27| I believe all y'all have a copy of the minutes from last month's meeting. Do I have a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=87)|
| 0:01:42| So, it's been approved and seconded, so it is approved and we will move on to the first item on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=102)|
| 0:01:54| which is our auditors. Ted Hotz is up. All right. Thank you. Would you want us just to stay here and present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=114)|
| 0:02:05| Do I need to come up to the podium? You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=125)|
| 0:02:11| Do I need to be there for the camera? For the camera. Okay. I will come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=131)|
| 0:02:18| For the public. Looking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=138)|
| 0:02:33| Okay, here we are. There are three documents that I want to go over today. One will be what we call the governance letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| basically roughly a 10 to 15 page document, a standalone document which you have a copy of that's stapled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=161)|
| 0:02:49| We will go over the CAFR, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. We'll not go into it anywhere near as much detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=169)|
| 0:02:56| as went over in the Finance Committee, but still feel like since the Audit Committee meeting we should go over it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| And as well, many of you did hear that at the Finance Committee meeting, but you've also had a few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| roughly a week to digest that, and if more questions came up in that time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| certainly now would be another good time to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| And we also have what we consider our compliance report, which is roughly a 35 page document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| which goes over compliance with grants and laws and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| So, I want to start with the letter, which starts a report to the Mayor, County Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| and Audit Committee on the outside. It's the stapled version and it's called the governance letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| You flip a few pages through and you come to what's labeled on the bottom as page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| It might be sheet four, but it's basically page one at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| And it starts the required communications section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| Basically, what this letter is designed to do is exactly what's said in the bottom of that top paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| It summarizes our responsibilities regarding the basic financial statement audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| as well as observations arising from the audit that are significant and relevant to your responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=245)|
| 0:04:14| The financial and related compliance reporting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| In a smaller entity, this is really a boilerplate letter and it doesn't necessarily say that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| And for a larger entity like Knox County, actually there's a fair amount of content in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| It starts the first, kind of focused really on the areas on the left-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| goes over what our responsibilities with regard to the financial statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| and basically to present them in accordance with auditing standards in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=279)|
| 0:04:48| and present them in compliance with governmental gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| It mentions the contract that signed at the beginning that started this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| and also mentions there are other entities that get merged into the county similar to a consolidation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| basically component units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| The overview of the planned scope and timing of the financial statement audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| This was discussed in the similar letter that we had in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| although that was probably three or four pages at that point in time, references that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| Accounting policies and practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| We are required to report if there were any accounting practices that the county followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| that were not considered the preferable method, and there were none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| So we state in here, management has selected the preferable accounting practice in all instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| On the next page, page two, we talk about adoption of or change in accounting policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| The big one adopted this year was GASB 75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| which covers basically OPEB or other post-employment benefits other than pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| and that was adopted this year, and it created a prior period adjustment with the adoption of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| because we had to calculate a liability based on this standard as of the beginning of the audit year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| So it wasn't a prior period adjustment from a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| It was a prior period adjustment because we adopted a new principle, which was required by GASB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| So basis of accounting followed standard modified accrual for governmental funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| and for accrual for proprietary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| Audit adjustments, we'll talk about them in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| They're summarized in Exhibit B, which is attached to this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| Just like uncorrected misstatements are in Exhibit C, which we'll talk about in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| No disagreements with management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| Second to last item on the left-hand side is significant issues discussed with management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| We do mention that we had several accounting and financial reported related issues during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| Really, that's just normal discussions during the course of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| but we have a lot of discussions with Chris Caldwell and his team and other departments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| Just do the normal course of the size of the entity and just the complexity of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=428)|
| 0:07:15| But nothing unusual resulted from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| It's really just a matter of having good communication on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| On the third page, we talk about report communicating any deficiencies in internal control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| and basically that's the compliance report that I'll talk about shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| Material written communication between our firm and management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| We reference Exhibit D, which is the representation letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Representation letter is what management represents to us as the audit firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| in their capacity as management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Page four starts summary of significant accounting estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| While we as auditors and accountants like to think of ourselves as exact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| there are a lot of estimates in larger, complex entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| As you go down the left-hand side, it shows the estimates that we used during the course of the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=487)|
| 0:08:15| and also listed here the accounting policy management's estimation process and basis for our conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=495)|
| 0:08:23| These estimates include fair value investment securities, allowance for uncollectible property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| depreciation of capital assets, self-insurance, health care and workers' comp claims and general liabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| interest rate swaps, net pension liabilities or assets of defined benefit plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| and the new one, GASB 75, implemented this year, net other post-employment benefits, liabilities of OPEB plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=522)|
| 0:08:53| On page seven lists a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| Seven and eight basically lists a summary of recorded audit adjustments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| and we're going to talk about this more in finding number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| We can refer back to this at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| but I want to come back to this really in conjunction with finding number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| Exhibit C, which is listed on page nine, lists items that really came up late in the engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=552)|
| 0:09:22| we did not want to record at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| They are under, particularly net, are under our materiality level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Think about how large the county is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| But we are required, even if they are not significant enough that we need to record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| we are required to inform the governance, you as the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| and the finance committee for that reason, what they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| So here is a list of what we passed on that was meaningful enough to disclose to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=589)|
| 0:09:58| And then Exhibit D is the management representation letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| Again, that is what management represents to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| And that takes the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| You will notice on the very last page, page 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| lists everyone who has signed the representation letter from the county and from the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| including which periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| For instance, Mayor Burchett signed for his period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| and Mayor Jacobs signed for anything that he would be aware of after that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| And as well, we had representatives from the schools or from the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| that signed for items that pertained to them, not pertaining to the whole entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| but pertaining to the schools or the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| Any questions on the governance letter so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| On the uncorrected misstatements, were you, I don't know that those get discussed further on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| but was everybody in agreement with these, management in agreement with these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Then for the CAFRs, what I want to talk about next, the big document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| You have the big red booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| If you have it online, good, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| Really, to start out with, like I said, I'm going to go over this fairly quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| because it's already been discussed at the Finance Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| but I do want you to feel free to ask any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| On Roman numeral page 15 through 17, which is in the introductory section tab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=700)|
| 0:11:51| actually I take that back, it's in the first page after the financial section tab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| is our independent auditor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Unlike a commercial entity where you can get an auditor's report on one page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| governments are different, they're special, they like us to say an awful lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| so it takes three pages to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| But really, on page 16, the second page in here, you'll see a caption labeled opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=731)|
| 0:12:20| and basically we say that the financial statements referred to above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| are fairly stated in all material respects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| So, in other words, you do have a clean opinion on the Knox County report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| Right after that, beginning on page 18, is your management's discussion and analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| and as Chris Caldwell said at the Finance Committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| this is a good place to go for a quick synopsis of the county operations for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| There's a financial highlight section that begins it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| and I like the charts that really start on page 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| and go for a few pages in there, really, and particularly through page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| You look at those, it kind of gives you a summary of your governmental perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=786)|
| 0:13:14| your fund balance perspective, and really looking at your proprietary funds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| So it's a good summary of your operations on all accounting basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| The basic financial statements, and really what I consider the core of the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| and what I look at, would spend the most time on, really begins on page 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| which obviously we're well into the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| but it's right after the basic financial statements tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| Page 1 is the statement of net position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| This is as if four accrual bases really is used for all activities of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| There's a column for governmental activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| There's a column for business-type activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| and most of the county is really centered in the governmental activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| And then there's separate columns for your component units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| your key one being the Knox County Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| which is in the fourth column to the right, and then non-major component units as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| and then a total reporting unit column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| There's also a statement of activities, which is your income statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| which is on page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| What I like to point out there is in the first column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| it goes all the way down to the bottom, the governmental activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| The third line from the top is your change in net position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| So from a governmental perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| you had an increase in fund balance of $25 million during the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| so a healthy fund balance increase on a four accrual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| On page 3 is your balance sheet for governmental funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| and your fund balances are at a healthy level in general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| I'll talk about the capital projects fund in the next report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| On page 5 is your summary of governmental funds by fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| general capital projects, debt service, and other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| And in that first column, you'll notice that general fund had an increase of $5.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| in the net change in fund balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| So from a budgetary perspective, which is what this page 5 represents, a budgetary basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=925)|
| 0:15:33| it was the general fund had a positive year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| The report goes on and on, and I could talk about a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| I really, again, focus on these pages in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| The notes follow after that, and there's a lot of reading that starts on page 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| and runs through page 140, so a lot of detail in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| Really, it talks about accounting policies here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| a lot of schedules regarding details of key assets, whether it's receivables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| including property taxes, or capital assets, or long-term debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| a lot of details about that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| We have required supplementary information, which begins on page 141,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| and for the most part, this is information about your pension plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| that you have interest in and your OPEB responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| other post-employment benefits, really health-related post-retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| And then beginning in the supplemental section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| which is beginning on page 158 right after the supplemental section tab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| a lot of good detail information on your individual funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| particularly your general fund starts off there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| but you can look at the detail of all your funds really in this section here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| The following tab gives all the detail for the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| and that begins on page 241, and then you have statistical section after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| So a lot of detail, although the summary of the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| is in the basic financial statement section and the MD&A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| but certainly when you want to look at the detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| take a look at the supplemental section for how the individual funds did during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| But financially, as Chris had noted earlier, it was a solid year for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| and any reserves are in healthy position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Hey, Ted, on the first couple of pages, the negative net position on the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| I think I know the explanation, but could you go over that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Yeah, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Let me just pull that up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1067)|
| 0:17:56| And you're referring to on pages one and two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Basically, that's a result of picking up all of the debt that the county is responsible for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1081)|
| 0:18:13| including its portion of any responsibility for the schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| So it's slowly but surely coming to a positive number, and we're not too far away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1098)|
| 0:18:28| So it includes responsibility for all debt that's in the county name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1108)|
| 0:18:38| So it's a factor of the long-term debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| And you say that's being paid down, that's coming down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| John, you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| I didn't remember it being negative in prior years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| It has been, and it was also impacted by the OPEB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| What it is is the county issues all the debt for all school buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| and all the assets, the school building assets are on the Board of Education column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| but none of the debt, and the county has all the debt and none of the buildings for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| And it's basically a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| That's because of state statute and state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| And that's not just unique to Tennessee, although it is part of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Same thing happened in North Carolina and other states as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| But as John says, it's because the county has to report all the debt, including the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1169)|
| 0:19:37| I've gone over a lot of documents, and sometimes I tend to get these confused, which numbers I saw where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| I know I saw a couple of issues with the bonds and some of the ones that were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| I guess we actually got the funding in late, three weeks late or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| Is that reflected anywhere in these statements, the impact of the bond or issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Well, it's reflected in a way that your capital improvements funds from the schools and from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| show a deficit at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| And that deficit was replenished once the bonds were issued in July of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1212)|
| 0:20:22| So it was really a temporary negative status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| I'm just looking at the funds, though, the fund balances on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1230)|
| 0:20:38| I see the capital projects improvement column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| That's where they got, I guess, the $13 million on page three, down at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| Yes, and for the schools, it would be shown on page 243.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1250)|
| 0:21:03| I'm not as well versed on those pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| Okay, that's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Anybody else have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Whichever is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Next, we'll go through the compliance report, which is the thinner booklet that you have of roughly 35 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1276)|
| 0:21:29| And it's labeled in the front schedules of expenditures of federal awards and state financial assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| and reports as required by government auditing standards and the uniform guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Uniform guidance basically is the new single audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| On page one is the compliance report on internal control over financial reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| and compliance in other matters based on the audit of financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| So it goes over internal control over financial reporting and compliance in other matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1314)|
| 0:22:01| And it does reference the first three findings following that bucket of internal control over financial reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1321)|
| 0:22:10| The second report begins on page three, and it's a report on compliance for each major program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1330)|
| 0:22:21| Major programs would be grant programs, federal grant programs that we selected to test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1341)|
| 0:22:29| and any findings related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| And we did have two findings, which were findings four and five, which are referenced in this report as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| I'm not going to really talk about them within the body of these two letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| I'm going to talk about them more so when we get to the findings section itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| Page six starts the schedule expenditures of federal awards, and it goes to page 14, I believe, for federal awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1366)|
| 0:22:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| At the bottom of page, and this includes both county federal awards and Board of Education federal awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1379)|
| 0:23:08| you'll notice that the total federal awards to the county and the Board of Education totaled over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| the bottom of page 14 on the right, totaled over $63 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| So significant funds from the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| Most of them to the school, as you'll see, the federal awards to the county Board of Education totaled $55 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| so $8 million to the county government as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| And from this schedule, we select our programs to test, and we tested three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1417)|
| 0:23:45| Well, I guess first of all, pages 15 through 17 show state financial assistance, which is provided as information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1425)|
| 0:23:54| We have a few generic notes to this schedule on pages 18 and 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1434)|
| 0:24:03| On page 20 starts the schedule of findings and question costs, and this is a summary that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1443)|
| 0:24:12| Good thing we had no material weaknesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| so I think it's been a couple of years since we've had no material weaknesses in our findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| so we had no material weaknesses this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| We had significant deficiencies identified, and the box check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| the third box under there, noncompliance material to financial statements noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| was because we had a compliance issue in finding number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| The federal awards, again, no material weaknesses, but we had two significant deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1479)|
| 0:24:47| You'll see the major programs listed that we tested were the Title I Special Education Cluster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, so those are the three grants that we tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| There's a dollar threshold that determines a Type A and Type B program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| Type A means it's a larger dollar and more likely to be selected to testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| That threshold's roughly $1.9 million, where basically it's 3% of your total federal expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| For smaller entities, it's a cut and dry $750,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| but it actually is the larger of the $750,000 or 3% of your total federal expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| So in most cases, you see $750,000, but for a large entity like Knox County, you use a 3% threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| The first finding is on page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| Ted, on the bottom of that page you were just on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| so we're not going to be qualified as a low-risk audit team next year, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1546)|
| 0:25:54| That was for this year, that you were not for this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| and have not gone through the assessment process for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| You're not automatically kicked out because you don't have a material weakness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| Do you go two years back for the material weakness or one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| I think that's true, you do go two years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| I think 16 had one and maybe 17 had one too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| We need to double check to see whether we labeled 17 as a material weakness or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| That would be the initial threshold for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| If 17's findings had a material weakness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| then we would automatically still be high-risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| The difference in high-risk and low-risk really dictates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| the minimum percentage of federal expenditures that we need to test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| If you're low-risk, you can test 20% or more as long as you meet all other testing requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1604)|
| 0:26:53| If it's high-risk, you have to test 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| Just as information, we tested 46% of federal expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| in the three grants that we tested this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| I'll proceed with finding number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| This deals with financial statement classification and review, 2018-01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1632)|
| 0:27:21| In the condition, basically, we noted certain items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| capital asset contributions of $3.4 million and $4.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| that were classified as operating grants and contributions instead of capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| That was one matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| We also noticed that state grants were classified as federal grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| The good news about this is these were reclassification issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| They were not adjustments from the standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| These did not affect the bottom line, did not affect total revenues or total expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| but they were significant in dollar amount that we felt like we needed to report them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| As well, this follows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| Last year, we had the issue with sick pay liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| where we had a significant adjustment that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| The good news here is that there's not an adjustment to reclassification this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| It's still something that we want to continue to have as a focal point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| that we want to continue just to focus on review of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1707)|
| 0:28:37| Recommendations down below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| just to continue to have a more thorough review of the financial statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| and management's response is below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| With that said, I still want to point out these are findings that we had during the course of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1730)|
| 0:28:59| Considering that we're out here for months and months doing testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| we're not going to have a perfect system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| Our focus is to come up with constructive ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| Some result in findings, some do not, that the county assesses and responds to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| Ideally, you have a finding in one year that's not a finding in the next year because they took care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| County has been very good about, and the schools for that matter too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| have been very good about taking ownership of findings and responding to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| and cleaning those areas up within the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| As Chris pointed out during the course of the finance committee meeting, Chris Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1781)|
| 0:29:49| the county is responsible for preparing the CAFR, this big book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| They prepare almost all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Our part is the audit report, the three opinion pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| There's a lot of detail in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| We do a thorough review and we're looking at it for weeks because there's a lot of detail in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| and we have a lot of suggestions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Still should be proud of the county finance department for taking ownership of the CAFR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| and everything they do for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| As part of our review, we did have some significant reclassifications this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| that we're pointing out in this finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| I think to follow up on that, somewhere at the beginning of the CAFR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| they got their certificate for the achievement and excellence for financial reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| So that follows right along with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| And that's in large part to their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Nothing else to go to number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| On your page 2223, so does the finance department or the trustees office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| do they need additional personnel at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Yes, that's going into finding number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| timeliness of general ledger receiving and bank account reconciliations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| There's a challenge of having the right number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| or right number of hours dedicated to that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| and Chris probably, the county can probably speak a little better to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| We noticed in there, the condition part is what we noticed during the course of the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| The second bullet point there, after criteria, there's a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| During the audit, we noted the following, the matter with the receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| and the matter with the bank accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| Part of our recommendation in A, under recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| is the county finance department should consider assigning additional personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| to post receipts to the general ledger in order to ensure all receipts are posted in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| We did have a challenge with that in our test period of November 17 to March of 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1930)|
| 0:32:20| Finding number two really is focused on the condition and the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| Management has their response, which is on page 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| which also kind of addresses that in the beginning of the second paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| It says on page 23, it says prior to commencement of the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| the finance department had increased the number of personnel and hours devoted to the posting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| So they had shifted and had addressed that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| And the beginning of the third paragraph says the trustee's office is working with county finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| to identify and receive revenue posted in the undistributed holdings account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| to the general ledger in a reasonable time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| That ends up being a bucket for unknown, which delays the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| So that ties in a little bit to the first paragraph where they talk about sometimes finance has to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| to get some of the information they need to be able to post it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=1999)|
| 0:33:28| They're related, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| Any more questions on two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Anybody else want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| Three is financing of capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| In many of these, I've kind of skipped over the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| but the criteria is important here since this is a noncompliance matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| The second sentence in the criteria is management should monitor funds available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| and the timing of capital expenditures to ensure adequate short-term or long-term financing is in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| to prevent expenditures from exceeding available funds and creating fund balance deficits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| In this regard, state law, Tennessee code annotated section 811104 contains requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| governing the payment of public obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| So basically in the cause and effect, the county spent cash to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| or construct capital assets prior to the issuing of the general obligation bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| or other short-term debt to provide financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| So it's really a matter of chicken and egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| The funding needs to be completely in place before a capital project starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| And that situation is what led to the negative fund balances in the two-capital project fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2091)|
| 0:34:59| Interestingly enough, and we both talked to David Sturter at the state about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2099)|
| 0:35:07| having a negative fund balance in itself is not against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| I guess if it was for a long period of time, there are actually provisions in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| where there is a state exception to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| But in this case, it really was just the indication of the financing of the capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2121)|
| 0:35:31| and the process as opposed to anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| And the negative fund balances kind of showed that there was something out on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2134)|
| 0:35:42| And as stated in the management's response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| they have explained what happened and also explained what procedures are going to follow going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| So we believe this to be something that will be fixed completely going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| All right, sir. Number four, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| Number four gets into federal award findings and with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| So this basically are federal grant findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| This deals with requests for reimbursement for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| It identifies the programs affected, child nutrition cluster, Title I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2184)|
| 0:36:33| IDEA, and 21st Century Community Learning Centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| Basically, the two issues are in the two paragraphs in the condition and context section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| We noted that monthly requests for reimbursements for certain programs were prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| without review and approval by the respective program director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| And then the second was we noticed two payments during the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| where federal reimbursements of $15,000 in total were held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| in the trustee bank accounts for three months before being forwarded to the cafeteria funds bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| The second part is fairly small in dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| Why it's included, though, is this was an issue the year before where it was nearly $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| And I think this is just some residual that happened earlier in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| Really, I think as of this point in time, that second part has been completely addressed and resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| But since it had a carryover effect from the prior year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| we had to report that amount even though it's relatively small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| And both in the management response that's on page 26| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| and in the corrective action plan that's on page 31, the schools have addressed this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2267)|
| 0:37:55| I was curious about the response to item four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2275)|
| 0:38:07| I guess it's the last two sentences in that first paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| So the finance department will request the state of Tennessee to add the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| And then if it's not granted or they don't add it, I guess is what you mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| then the finance group will take internal measures to make sure that the approval is received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| Is that what that's saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| I think, well, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| There's an electronic process that they follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| And if there's not a change in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| then it's going to have to be an internal process that covers the approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| I guess we're good on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Then on number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| this deals with equipment management for the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| The programs where it affected are listed, Title I, special education grants, IDEA, and we have Title I and IDEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2360)|
| 0:39:32| And the condition in context lists basically the four exceptions noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| And again, this dealing with equipment management, record keeping of capital assets, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2378)|
| 0:39:48| So the four exceptions are listed in the condition, dealing with property records, reconciliations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| documentation on inventories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| So really those are the matters that were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2402)|
| 0:40:11| And we have listed recommendations in the recommendations section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2411)|
| 0:40:19| Dealing management should update equipment listings, include the items required by uniform guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| Management should perform the required biennial inventory of all equipment every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| And management should consider the need for implementing an organization-wide equipment inventory system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| to better account for board equipment and to minimize the diversity in practice between departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| So from a response standpoint, you really need to focus on the corrective action plan, which is on page 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2442)|
| 0:40:55| I agree. I knew I was missing something because when I was seeing the management's response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| I thought I'd read something not so much different than the corrective action plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| Typically not. But the corrective action plan is really what you should focus on for item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| The board will review the procedures related to equipment management, including updating the equipment list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| describe the required items, reconcile the inventory list, and perform the biennial inventories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| And they'll have ongoing discussions regarding implementation of a comprehensive asset management software system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| to address equipment management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| Basically, the ongoing discussions are they've got to assess and try to find one that's cost-effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| So this one involves mostly the schools, this last one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| The last two deal with grant programs of the schools, federal grant programs, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| Does the schools, do they want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| Have they already instituted a software system for their inventory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| They're looking at a software system that will cover all of their equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Okay, so it's still in process, nothing's in place at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Correct, it's still in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| And a lot of that really comes down to finding one that will satisfy the federal requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| at a cost that's responsible for the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| One quick question on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| It seems like, reading it here, this one may have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| they mentioned that there was turnover in the position responsible for tracking this particular inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Just, this is more of a statement of opinion, and the school board, or the school folks maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| is this more a reflection of not having a person in this position or turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| or do you think the systems, are they going to make that big a difference on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| It just, it left out to me that when you see one of these and they mention turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| sometimes I wonder how much of it is, was our system in place wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| or did we just have turnover and then not train the person up correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| I think it's a combination of the turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| and just being new to what responsibilities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| and then not having the ideal system to be able to track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2593)|
| 0:43:25| Well, I like the approach and attitude of the folks with the schools in fixing these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| and what little bit I've gotten exposure I've gotten to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| I've got a lot of confidence that they take care of these issues whenever they're pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| and they've got a good group on board there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| And I want to reiterate something I said earlier in the governance letter section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| We have, as auditors, our audit management team, which includes Larry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| and who's not here today because he has a state board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| and he hates to miss an audit committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| It kind of crushes Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| We wish he was able to be here, but he had to be in Nashville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| But John Sutton and Gary Mitchell there do an awful lot for us to get us through the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| But we have regular meetings, our team has regular meetings with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| including Chris Caldwell and Melanie Welk and Perry Benshoof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| And Chris Simons has been with the schools, has been in all of our meetings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| So there's a lot of collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| And as auditors, we really appreciate the collaboration that we get with both the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| and the schools in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| Any other questions for Ted, or do you have anything else there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| Three reports, but I'm certainly open for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| And, you know, if anybody from, if Chris with the county or anyone from the schools wants to comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2698)|
| 0:45:07| they're more than welcome to if there's anything they want to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| It looks like they're okay with where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Thanks, Ted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Next we'll do internal audit update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| We had, since it was such a short time period, we had a, do I need to be up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| I'm being told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| I don't know, I assume we're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| Since it was, since we just met in December, we have some activity, but not a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| Most of our activity is starting new projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Since we had a lot of closures on the last audit committee meeting, we started several new projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| Hotline, we only had one new case come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| We closed three, so that leaves us with four left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| The one new case was a referral, so if you look at the Hotline type of project chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2760)|
| 0:46:08| pie chart that I sent you, that one was just referred out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| so it had very little impact on our audit staff this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2770)|
| 0:46:18| We completed things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| We have to look at our office procedures periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| I've redone those in our templates to make sure we're in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| Forensic center fees, we talked about last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| We've closed that and started the control risk evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| That's already in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Current projects, PPU should be issued in draft this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| It's already partially written, and it's waiting my review, or it's mostly written as waiting my review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| so it should go out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Things we started new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| Payments in lieu of taxes and tax incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| Susan's going to be leading that project, and Garrick is going to be working with her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| so that audit has been initiated, and the planning is in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| The planning meetings are starting to take place in the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| The objective of that audit, the objectives will be to look at controls that are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| to ensure adherence to the terms of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| So when we're giving contracts to these entities and giving them tax abatements and tax incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2835)|
| 0:47:24| are they fulfilling their requirements to receive those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| So we'll be looking at those, and if there's any violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| and we have controls in place to resolve those, what are we doing about those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| We also kicked off sheriff's office inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| That will be on the property, the seized and found property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| So the objectives of that will be to look at if the seized and found property in the custody of the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| is properly accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| That has been kicked off, and the planning meetings are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| And then we did kick off also a travel audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| That would be to evaluate the employee travel expenses for compliance with Knox County's travel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| So it would look at any organization that follows Knox County's travel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| So we have worked with finance to identify who's self-reporting that they're following it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| and then Zach also went and followed up with the various other entities just to verify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| are you or are you not really following this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| So that should cover the majority of the travel under the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| So I believe you're saying there are some people who don't have to follow the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| It's my understanding the elected officials can create their own travel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| So you can adopt Knox County Finance's travel policy, or you can create your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| So right now we're just going to look at those under Knox County's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| If there's other entities that are large and following their own policy, we would do a separate audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| This should get the majority of, I believe, the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Schools follows it, Knox County Mayor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| So this would be a large chunk of the travel expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| And maybe this is off base just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| but I'm curious if we've had instances in the past where people did not follow Knox County and came up with their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| Was it very similar? Do we know what the situation was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| In my experience, and Chris may be able to talk more about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| I've not done an audit that didn't follow Knox County's travel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| So any entity that we've audited that we've looked at associated travel, they've all followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Well, I'm really asking are there any groups that have their own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Christina?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2975)|
| 0:49:43| I think CAC may have their own. We do their accounting for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| The big difference that I know that if you fall under the mayor, what we do is we have a pre-approval travel form to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=2989)|
| 0:50:00| And if it's out of state, then we get that signed off by the chief of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| If you're an elected official, then you don't have to get that signed off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3004)|
| 0:50:12| But we did go through a process this year with the auditors to where myself, as the finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| should sign off on elected officials' travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| That way there's a second person signing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| It's not a pre-approval per se, but it is a sign off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| Commissioner Smith, do you have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| This falls under the employee handbook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| and if every elected official's office is given the opportunity to either adopt the county handbook or write their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3036)|
| 0:50:45| and I believe the law department might be the only one that's written their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| The law department has its own, but it has adopted the travel policy of the county, so we're right in line with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3052)|
| 0:51:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| So probably everybody is under the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| I think the big difference would be the pre-approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| Now, the only thing that would be different is if we're under a federal grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| or a state grant that has different reimbursement rates, but that would be separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| Okay, so I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| That's not really a big issue, the large exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| We also, like I said, kicked off the control risk evaluation program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| so Garrick has been hard at work at that, already met with Forensic Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| and has already gone through their controls walkthrough to help identify where the areas are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| So that field work is way in progress, and he and I are going to meet and iron out what deliverables we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| what do we want to give back to them, and what information you all might want from those processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3106)|
| 0:51:54| And then really the most of what I believe we would talk about today is the impending question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3114)|
| 0:52:03| what do we do about hotline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Our hotline contract is up June 30th, so we've renewed it as many times as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| So our options for the hotline are to put an RFP out and get a new hotline administered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| So right now our hotline is administered through a third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| They operate the website, they handle all the IT, everything in accordance with that website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3142)|
| 0:52:31| You can report online or by phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| If you call in, their operator talks to you and walks you through and enters the information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| They then forward the information to us, pass it off to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| We do everything after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| So they're basically the intake, the triage of the hotline process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| We have renewed as many times as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| Our current contract with them is a little under $10,000 a year for them to administer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| So we have a couple of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| We can do another RFP, which we'd want to start soon, so we could do it so that it would be in place by July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3183)|
| 0:53:13| Our other option is I've been looking, because we've had so many problems with auto audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| I was exploring other work paper systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| There is another work paper system called ACL, which is Audit Command Language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| It's actually written for auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| And they have a GRC system, which is Government Risk and Compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| Theirs has a hotline module already included in it, but it would only be web-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| It wouldn't have a call-in option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| So it would be a fully web-based where you can customize exactly the information you want people to enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| You can route it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| It's a very customizable program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| We would have complete control over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| Even in the county, if it was needed to go to certain people, we could automatically route to those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3232)|
| 0:54:00| The system is about $25,000 a year for the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| So right now, with auto audit and the current hotline vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| which I don't know what the RFP would bring back and what the price would be for a new hotline vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| we're paying about $12,000 to $15,000 a year, depending on if we have to buy a new auto audit license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3254)|
| 0:54:22| So the difference between the two systems would be the hotline platform is included and it's a web-based system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3262)|
| 0:54:31| So we wouldn't have any responsibility for administering the IT component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| which right now we have to do the server maintenance and a lot of the IT components on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| So those are our two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| So I just wanted to talk about the audit committee, your input, where should we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| because we can do the audit work paper package separate or we could do it with a module or we could just do an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| I just wanted to get some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| Those are kind of our two big administrative budget items that we would love to include on this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| I've got maybe a dumb question, and I don't see anybody from our IT department here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| but that process of submitting a complaint or an issue through a hotline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| is that something that we've ever looked at someone from our IT department possibly developing in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| No, we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| I mean, do we even know if that's something that they, if Zach's got the bandwidth or if that's something that they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| They developed a GIMS, so I'm sure they can develop some sort of database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| It would be a web form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| I'm coming up behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| I wonder if you want to provide some insight on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| I know from an IT standpoint, they're more directing things that are outside, out of the box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| not developing our own but going more towards things that are supported out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| So that takes the risk off of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| And so if there's things that are out there that she's interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| they would push her more in that direction than us doing it in-house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| because when we do that, then any issues that we have are on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| So it kind of reduces our risk by having a third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Almost the whole principle of audits in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| so you outsource this to a third party so that they can be that independent collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| Are there many vendors in this space that we would even give a heads-up to on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| I'm guessing you probably Googled hotline vendors, but are there very many vendors in this space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3388)|
| 0:56:35| It really depends on, I know we have ours and there's two or three others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| but I don't know how many we would get, how many vendors would come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| and what their pricing would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| And I don't know how many they got the first time because we took the program over before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| or after they already had established the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| So we just got it in 2017, so we didn't get to participate in the last RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Would it be worth reaching out to some of the other larger counties in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| and asking them who they use as a resource for this type of a program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3430)|
| 0:57:19| And then who the vendor is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| Yeah, and probably the state because I think the state, they have their hotline too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| and they may cover it for some of the counties that aren't municipalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| that aren't big enough to have their own audit hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| Andrea, I know we've discussed your current program on the audit or whatever it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3457)|
| 0:57:46| and I understand there's always been a problem with sometimes saving, sometimes not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| but are there other disadvantages to the system that you see that the new software has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| and does the new potential software have some type of exposure throughout the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| of internal audit groups that use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| So there's quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| This particular software is used more on a state and federal level than it is on the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| So the state of Tennessee has a contract with this company to use their software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| and that's where you actually piggybacked on theirs to get our analytics software on theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| It is a web-based software, so I think one of the risks, it's a cloud-based system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| so the risk is you don't control the cloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| Someone else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| I've talked to them about that, and I believe they told me they do a statement of controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| like an audit that they will give you that they've been audited on their controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| The thing that goes with that cloud system means that it's available anywhere, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3530)|
| 0:58:59| Like I could pull it up on my phone right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| So it's really accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| So I think that's one of the cons is it's not in control of our servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| We don't actually have control over the protection, the controls, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| The things that I really liked about the software is it's very form-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| So auto audit is very Word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| I have to import these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| This gives me, like, a form I fill out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I can customize that, and then I can push a button and send it to the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| without duplicating what I've already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| There's a lot of push-pull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| Another really good thing that I liked about it, it's very visual dashboard-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| It tells you right where you are, how much you've had an audit complete, what's not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| It has some good statistics that I would have to calculate manually that it does automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| I can look at an audit project and clearly see how much is done in it right when I open the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| So that auto audit doesn't give me those visual cues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| I have to kind of look through it and calculate how much is complete versus how much isn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| where this actually gives you, like, a dashboard of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| The other thing that I really liked about it was that everything is contained in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| If we do an audit request right now, I go through my email, I email someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| So, for instance, like the audit notifications, that comes out of my personal email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| or Susan's personal email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| We can send it directly out of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| Any responses are included in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| It's all contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| We don't have to worry about moving documents back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| And from the standpoint of a lot of our work is protected, it never gets on the email system at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| It's only in ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| We can do a chat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| So that system allows you to do a chat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| So if you ask multiple questions, they can upload their documents right in that chat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| It goes as part of the audit record immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| You don't have to do anything to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| And one of the other nice things we can't do right now is I cannot bookmark in a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| So when I want to refer to a specific place, I have to say you can go to this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| and then try to describe where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| ACL will let you actually point specifically to exactly what you're talking about in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| Those are some of the things that I thought were improved efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| So I don't know if there would be hiccups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| And, of course, when you're talking to the salespeople, they're telling you all the wonderful things in the demo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| So it looked like a very usable system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| It would change the way we did our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| It would become less Microsoft Office-driven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| more driven to actually entering the information in the system than pulling from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| So you would write your report as you go, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| and then push that information from your summary work paper directly into the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| Your template would be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| The reporting, the referencing would be so much faster because it would be a push-pull type system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| Commissioner Nystrom has a question, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Well, actually, I've already spoken, and go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| Yeah, I was just going to voice one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| I mean, I've worked with ACL before and had great experiences with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| If I caught the numbers right, is it only another $2,000 to $5,000 on top of the hotline for auto audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3744)|
| 1:02:32| Was it $12,000 to $15,000 all-inclusive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| $12,000 to $15,000 is hotline plus our auto audit fees annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| So ACL would be about $25,000 a year but would include the hotline module.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| So we wouldn't have a separate contract for the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| It would all just be in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| We wouldn't have to pay someone to administer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| And a lot of their fees, since it is cloud-based, the server, it's more expensive because I'm not installing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| Right now, I'm the troubleshooter for auto audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| So IT has to do all the testing, and if they send out an upgrade or a patch, IT has to test it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3784)|
| 1:03:13| and I have to test it, and then I have to download it to every system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| So it's taking that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| So there's some inherent cost that really isn't quantified in that invoiced cost that is added into auto audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3798)|
| 1:03:26| And I don't know if there's a way to quantify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| I mean, I know from what I've heard from you and then the experience that I've had with the different softwares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| that there is a pretty substantial level of efficiency, it sounds like, that could be gained by something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| So to the extent that there is a way to kind of quantify the amount of time you're talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| I think it would be real useful to see how much more efficiency there might be able to get from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| Yeah, they gave us some statistics, and I think it was like a 40% improved efficiency rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| that was reported by shops that had converted to this particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| And I can see why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| When they demoed the program, it forces you to streamline your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| The way that it works, it kind of forces you to do your work different, to process it different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| which is not a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| Well, I wonder if we do an RFQ or an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| You could mention different options in it, but I mean, just moving quickly on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| have you heard of Red Flag Reporting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| I think that's the hotline company that provides Davidson County with their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| Just frankly, I went to the internal audit department for Davidson County and found them in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| Just as we begin to do some research, that appears to be a good vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| if they're handling Davidson County's bandwidth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| What more specifically, at this point in the budget cycle, do you need from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| I mean, I guess it's kind of always been an ongoing cost of around $10,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| but we don't know exactly what we're going to get back for the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| You said we renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Did we begin with a five-year contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| How have our contracts been, with two years or auto renewals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| There are four with the option to renew for four more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| I think our last one was a four-year option to renew annually for up to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| So we're at the end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| So we've been eight years is what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Yeah, we researched it, and this year was our last renewal when we renewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| For budget-wise, I guess we just need to decide what we want to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| It's kind of a gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| If we do an RFP, I don't know what they're going to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| I don't know how close to what we were paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| or if it will be more depending on the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| If it's an RFP, I definitely want to make sure that we put in an estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| for contract services versus a flat amount for more of an ACL software package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3958)|
| 1:06:08| But we probably need to decide and put it out there soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| If we decide to do an RFP, we probably need to go ahead and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| When is the timeline on it finally ending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| I mean, is this calendar year or fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| It ends June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| It's a fiscal year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| So, yeah, we do need to kind of get this into budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| because it would probably, having gone through a handful of really deep dive contract renewals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3990)|
| 1:06:39| I don't think this will be as bad as looking for a new investment company that we did at the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| But I'm guessing it would take at least a month or two to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| you hire them by May to give them two months or so to ramp up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| So you'd probably want to have the month of April to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| You'd probably want to have it posted sometime in March, I would guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Is that a timeline that you're thinking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| If we make a decision, I'd like to move it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| If we want to interview, do presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| So it sounds like either way, for sure, we're going to have to do this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| So we'll take your lead on probably the timeline on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| It's just a matter of how much money you're going to want to put in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| I mean, is it going to be $15,000 a year for the next four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| Yeah, that one's a hard one since we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| Now, we approve the final budgets probably by the time you post this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| but then the budgets will get approved probably after you've had responses to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| And I'm 100% confident you guys will work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| I wonder if that's the right approach, is we put this out for bid, budget season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| yeah, we're probably not going to approve the final, final budget until end of May, early June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| That might mean that this gives you a chance to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| and you can bring back to us the options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| and then we can probably try to help include that in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Just to kind of follow up on the budget question, so for this, for FY20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| have you submitted anything to the finance department for what your department needs at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| No, it's due like in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Two weeks or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Yeah, we've been working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| We've already started the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| These are kind of the numbers that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| What do I put in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| Do I ask for something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Do I put a placeholder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| Which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| We can put a placeholder, and then as the RFP comes in, we can actually give them an actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| Yeah, would you prefer to have one resource for just the, not only the hotline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| but also like what ACL does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| Would you like to have that all as one, so it's one call to get the result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| Yeah, I would love that package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| I think it, I really liked what they, I didn't expect to like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| I thought it was going to be a huge, like oversell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| but I really enjoyed like the way that it worked and the visual aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| I'm open to, I mean, auto audit, knock on wood, has been okay right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| We haven't had any huge hiccups in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| But, you know, we had talked about looking at other vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| and that's one of the better vendors out there that has a hotline included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| So once they told me that, I was like, well, that would be really nice to just kind of include it all in one system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| All the hotline stuff would automatically come into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| It would all be in one encapsulated program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| It wouldn't be coming from multiple sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| So that, it also is very customizable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| I think that, Navix doesn't seem to be right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| and I don't know if that's something we could ask another vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| So when we're talking about these classes of what's the cause or what's the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| I can't assign that in the Navix system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| I can't run a report out of their system with the things that we might want to know about their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| And ACLs, there's a possibility I can customize that system to meet the needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| the reporting needs a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| Well, why don't, temporarily, why don't you include in your budget the $25,000 expenditure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4198)|
| 1:10:07| and then we'll see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| At least you've got it requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| Agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| And I don't know if that's something we need to recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| or if Chris, if that's okay for her to put that in her budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| I think that was a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| Or forget it, one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4227)|
| 1:10:38| I think she needs to put that in her budget then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| Agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| To just see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Do we need a motion or a vote or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Mr. Smith, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| Commissioner Smith, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| I know this is state law that requires us to have this audit line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| but how many prosecutions or ethics complaints have we been able to file through this procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| Since I've had it, we've had no prosecutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| Do we need a motion for a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| It's agreed that go ahead and put it in your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| and then we'll go through the procurement process, interviews, whatever we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| And then keep as posted as how that's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| By year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| And that concludes my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| The next item is just if there's any other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| I don't believe we have anybody for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| The date for the next meeting, I don't really have a preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| We could probably be a good update financially from Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| Chris, I know you all got one last week through December, I think, financial update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| Ted, I don't know what you'd have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| In other words, I'm trying to say is do we do two months or three months from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| Do it in March or April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| We will not have a report next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4335)|
| 1:12:23| If we need something earlier, you can always call a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| So I don't have, what is your all's meeting date in April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| Probably the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| It's Earth Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| And that's April 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| That would be the Monday after Easter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| That would be Easter Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| I don't know the county holiday schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| I wonder if we would be shipping that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| That's the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| Is that a county holiday, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| The 19th is the county holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| So yeah, we've got a good Friday, but I think they'll be back at work on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| Are they going to have their meeting that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| When I reviewed our commission schedule when the calendar was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| that was the day that we were going to be meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| So we've got pension at 3, beer board at 4, commission at 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| zoning's at 7 on the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| You could do 130 again like this meeting because it just kind of flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| All right, the last item, and I think we'll go through this quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| We talked some at our last meeting about the new public, the Tennessee Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| they call it 9-3-4-0-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| about where we could consider having a confidential non-public executive session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| where we would take a vote now if we so choose, and then we would adjourn this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| go to this confidential meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| So I guess the easiest way I see this is, does anybody see the need to have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| And if not, we'll just pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| And I don't know if that needs to go through the formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4454)|
| 1:14:24| We should probably vote to or not to have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| Do we need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| I can say I'll make a motion for us not to have an executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| Go ahead and vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| To Mr. Skidmark, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| So this would be forever and ever, but what if we ended up needing one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| Not every meeting will ask the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Well, the only reason I'm putting it on here is because the way I read the statute is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| you have to have it on your agenda to be able to go to that meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| Okay, but you could add it any time you wanted then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| If there's an emergency and you needed to have an executive session, he could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| but by having it on our agenda, if we have, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| a more routine matter that requires an executive session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| we'll have it ready to go every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| And somebody had to ask a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| This is my suggestion, just to put it on here and have it and use it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4528)|
| 1:15:36| It's typical what comes out of Nashville has vagueness, ambiguity in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| How much money did it cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Everybody that's had anything to say about this so far has been correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| There are very few things that can go into executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| It's tied in, this statute is tied in with the Open Records Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| of which there are 350-plus exceptions to what's in Open Records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| And it says anything that's subject to Open Records is subject to executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| Generally speaking, with the county commission, it's much more limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| You can only get an executive session with regard to pending or threatened litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4576)|
| 1:16:25| That's it, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| This is much broader than that, but there are two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Number one, you need an agenda item, but you've got to specify what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| Not to the point that the confidentiality is removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| but if, for instance, you want to deal with something that Andrea comes up with on the fraud hotline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| of course that's confidential under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| So you would say agenda item, and you've got to itemize what you're going to go into session on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| So you'd say fraud hotline issues, just very generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| If it's with regard to litigation, then you would say with regard to pending litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| and that's why it's kind of a weird thing to put on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| In the list of the five items, what I tried to do in today's agenda is list three of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4630)|
| 1:17:18| that were potentially going to be discussed here, whether it's audit findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| Hotline, I think, is the fifth one, if I remember right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| So I tried to at least, I didn't list all five of them as a reason to have the executive session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| Whether or not that has anything to do with what you're saying in changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| If you want a boilerplate, I would suggest that you itemize these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| I think the better thing is to hold off, and if the chairman, if Andrea goes to the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| or the law office goes to the chairman and says we really need to put this on as pending litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| or fraud hotline or this other matter under 405 where a party has requested anonymity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4678)|
| 1:18:10| you need to say that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| So I don't know that you need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| Unless there's going to be something, my preference would be not to put a boilerplate in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| but get the information of the chairman so he can put it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| But that's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| However you want to do it is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| I think it would meet the requirement of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| And again, I listed, I just said which of those five there you're looking at we would consider going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| If we had to adjust that, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| But if you're going to do the boilerplate, I would itemize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| other than just saying under the statute subdivision this, this, and this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| I would put the itemization that's in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| We can consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| Is there any other comment or thoughts about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| So we're not having that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| There was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| Is that the call of the chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| Because we have no business before us that warrants an executive session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| so that would be the chair's call not to convene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| We do not need a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| I think you all already did the motion and second, so it can be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Consider my motion withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| So there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| If there's nothing else, do we have a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| Good evening, and welcome to the January meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| Thank you, everyone, who has made the time to be with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| To begin tonight's meeting, I'm going to ask Commissioner Charles Busler to lead us in a devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4788)|
| 1:19:56| I'll then get the roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| When you do a devotional, you have to do some definitions, and so I looked up devotional or devotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4802)|
| 1:20:10| and, you know, it can mean a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| It can mean a 1960s musical group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| It can be a town in North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| It can be a Bible study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| It can be some sort of philanthropy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| But most of the time we do it as a short Christian study or a lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| So I took it at that point that we go with one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| and I use this term devotion to use a term to describe friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4833)|
| 1:20:42| And friendship is one of God's greatest gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| It's one of his greatest gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| To be a friend requires truth, faithfulness, and respect, things that you must give before you can get a true friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4851)|
| 1:21:00| A person can accomplish a lot by oneself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| but the feeling of accomplishment is much greater when you can share it with a friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| Trials and trouble are easier to deal with or handle with a friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| and a friend is a true friend that will give you correction and advice when you need correction and advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| and will help you through that problem and will not abandon you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| So in the definition of devotion, I say it's truth, it's trust, accomplishments, truth, relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4890)|
| 1:21:40| and to me that is the purpose of this lesson is to say devotion is that and that of a true friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4900)|
| 1:21:48| So let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| God, we thank you for this time of trying to do the business of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| Give us leading hand and point us in the direction we should be going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4916)|
| 1:22:03| Help us to make the correct decisions and help us to understand what it means to be a friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| not only to one another but to our public and people that we not truly understand but want to meet in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4929)|
| 1:22:17| Help us to understand these truths that you send to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| In all this we pray in your son's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| Madam Clerk, could you call roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4946)|
| 1:22:40| Actually, yeah, let's do roll first because I was waiting for Michelle to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| Go ahead, call the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4967)|

| 1:23:11| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Commissioner Smith, would you lead us in the pledge of allegiance to the flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| And give the proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=4997)|
| 1:23:41| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| As we begin tonight's meeting, I've noticed a handful of elected officials have joined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| us and other dignitaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| I'm also going to be very intentional in recognizing, and on behalf of the thousands of school children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5032)|
| 1:24:00| in Knox County, I would like to thank and recognize Superintendent Bob Thomas because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5040)|
| 1:24:08| school has been canceled tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| On behalf of all the parents who are looking for child care, they would probably prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| to rescind that recognition, but anyhow, if you're watching at home, kids, you may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| just found out that Knox County Schools has been canceled tomorrow for a matter of safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| purposes because of the potential risk of winter weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| For those of you who are first joining us at this, I also want to thank and recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| Mayor Glenn Jacobs, who is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| I saw Criminal Court Clerk Mike Hammond earlier, I see Mike Hammond in the back, and I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5086)|
| 1:24:53| Sheriff Tom Spangler, so Sheriff Spangler, thank you for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Is there any other elected officials or folks that I have missed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| Janice Tocher, where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| From MPC, thank you for joining us, and we have Vice Mayor Louise Pavlin from the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| of Farragut, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| At this point, we move into the public forum part of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| I'm going to make a couple of minor modifications to this, if this pleases this body, kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| similar to what we did last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| I have one person who signed up on public forum to speak to Keith Lyon on deputy pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5129)|
| 1:25:36| raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| I also have a handful of folks who have signed up to speak to item 35 on tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5137)|
| 1:25:45| What I'd like to do is ask all those who have signed up to speak to item 35, we will invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5145)|
| 1:25:53| you to speak to that subject and make you part of that discussion when we get to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| item on the agenda, rather than doing it right now and then moving into the agenda and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| coming back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| I think that would be the most valuable for you and for this body as they deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| I'm looking in the audience and I seem to be seeing nodding heads, and I see that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| So, what I'd like to do right now is find out also, Mayor Jacobs, I think you may want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5173)|
| 1:26:21| to speak to item 35 as well, and we'll handle all of that when we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| I have our deputy, Keith Lyon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| So, Keith, would you like to speak to the subject of deputy pay raises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| You've got five minutes, and when you get to the podium, please formally state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Keith Lyon, President of Fraternal Order of Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5200)|
| 1:26:53| Pretty soon, the sheriff will be coming to you with the budget, and he's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| asking for raises for our officers on the streets and our correction officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| I implore you to give this some serious thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| It also will help with recruitment and retention, and also it's a step towards competing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Just so you understand, law enforcement recruitment is down 75 percent, not just here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| but across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| And Knox County hires from the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| People don't just sign up for their communities and join up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| The reason why they're down, it's a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| Number one is pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| People are getting a college education these days and spending $40,000, and when they look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| at law enforcement salaries, they understand, hey, I'm starting out with less than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| I paid for a college education, and given today's environment, it's not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5263)|
| 1:27:50| So what does a police agency have to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| They have to raise the salaries a bit to attract more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| It's a very small pool that Knox County has to hire from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| Like I said, it's 75 percent down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| And also to retain those people that Knox County hires and trains and also enjoys the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| reputation of having one of the most professional areas of law enforcement in the entire country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| There's people from all over the country that come to Knox County to see two agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| to see how they handle everything from a parking ticket to ride control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| That's quite a reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| Knox County has been operating understaffed for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| It's hard to get new people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| Knox County also loses an average of one to five officers to each Knoxville City Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| class because the benefits and the pay is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5320)|
| 1:28:48| To understand what Knox County is competing with, this past year in 2017, 14 law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| agencies across the country have understood how the job market affects law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| It's a matter of supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| When the supply is low like it is now, you have to raise the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| Fourteen agencies posted a starting salary of $40,000 and $50,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| It's hard to compete with those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| Lateral entry program for most agencies in Texas is $72,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| That's people with 12 years of experience or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| In Atlanta, they just passed a resolution offering a 33 percent across-the-board pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| raise for their police officers to be phased in over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| It's kind of hard to compete with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| It is a job competition and Knox County needs to take a step up and go to bat for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| A lot of them are working right now, you know, none of them work 40 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| Constantly, officers are being held over and also they have to come in on their days off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| without pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| Normal books, they get comp time, but when you're understaffed, there isn't time to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| So basically, you're still left with zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| Knoxville and Knox County can't continue to live on this reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| To give you an idea how bad this has affected recruitment in Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| back in 1992, the average number of applicants to both academies was around 2,500 apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5420)|
| 1:30:28| Now, today's date, less than 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| That's got to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5432)|
| 1:30:39| And also, consider mine too, the cost of living has gone up considerably in 10 years, 46 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5439)|
| 1:30:47| cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| The same stuff that you buy in the stores these days are 46 percent higher than they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| was 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| That's a heck of a drain on an officer's pocket, especially when they've not gotten a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| raise in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| Please keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| Knoxville and Knox County needs to be able to train these officers and keep these officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| Knoxville and Knox County both, if you get your academy certificate here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| you can get a job for better benefits just about anywhere in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| We need to stop spending money and training these officers just for them to go enjoy a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| career somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| Just keep that in mind when the budget comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| The next item on our agenda is, I'm sorry, yes, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| I just wanted to ask Keith Leonard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| You've got a question from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| So my number one, thank you, and thank you for your presentation, my number one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| is how long has the pay structure been like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| And number two, being what I've been around law enforcement my entire life, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| that I've noticed is the way the percentages are structured, whenever we give them, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| majority of these percentages go to chiefs, captains, and things like that, and you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| got people that are kind of your officers, your corrections, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5533)|
| 1:32:20| Maybe if we could look into something, maybe look into our rules and guidelines to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| if there's something that we could talk with with Sheriff Spangler, and maybe go over some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| things before budget gets here, if we could have a, maybe sit down with you as well, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| do you know how long it's been since the pay scale's been structured that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| I don't have an exact number on the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| The salary has been about the same without significant increases for at least eight to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| What's the step increase for the city that they have every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| Two and a half percent cost of living raise each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| Does the county have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| Thank you, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Commissioner Carringer would also like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| It's really more of a comment, but thank you so much for coming, and just making everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| aware if they're not aware of it, but I want to say that when you said they're called in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| and they get compensated for their time, but every time those officers come in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| go on duty, they're putting their lives at risk, and they might get a day off for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| but let's hope that they get that day to take off, but what they're putting their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5610)|
| 1:33:37| out there for and doing for us, we need, as Knox County, we need to invest in our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5617)|
| 1:33:45| We need to recruit the best of the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| We have a great training academy, and we lose officers, and I don't blame them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| I don't blame them for going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| Everybody wants to be able to better themselves every possible way that they can, and feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5639)|
| 1:34:07| appreciated and feel wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| So we need, when we bring in these men and women into our academy, Knox County needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5649)|
| 1:34:16| to invest in them, and keep them in Knox County, and not lose them to Oak Ridge, to Brunt County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5656)|
| 1:34:25| to Maryville, and all these other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| So thank you so much to all the men and women, and I don't know how we would survive without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5668)|
| 1:34:35| you all giving your lives, and for your families, that it's a tough job, and it's very emotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5675)|
| 1:34:44| and it's very stressful, and it's a physical job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| So thank you very much for looking out for your fellow officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| Also, too, when these officers are assigned comp time, keep in mind, too, the agency is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5697)|
| 1:34:58| Nine times out of ten, if it's four or five hours, they're going to lose those hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| There's not going to be time to take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| And also, any time a SWAT, the SWAT team is called in, the negotiator unit, anybody, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| an investigator that's called in on their time off, they're not getting paid overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| They're getting paid comp time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| And chances are, they lose that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| Are there any other questions or comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| Okay, the next item on our agenda is item D, which is honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| We do have an honorary resolution before us, however, that item is going to be deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| to February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| So when we formalize our agenda next, that will be moved into the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5741)|
| 1:35:48| Next item on our agenda is approval of the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| Do I have a motion to approve last month's minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| Okay, a motion has been made by Commissioner Carringer and seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5766)|

| 1:36:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| We're now at the part of our agenda where we actually set and finalize the agenda to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| get the work of commission done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| Following up from our work session last week, when we, for folks who are in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| and for folks who are watching at home, what happens at the county commission work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| is we do spend a lot of time trying to formalize and set our agenda so we can be productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| at this actual meeting where we formally vote on topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| A number of items for both the education calendar as well as the general government calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| have been put on consent and we will vote on all of those items with one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| So at a point in tonight's meeting, the county clerk's office will be reading those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| into the minutes just to get them done and we will be formalizing the agenda just on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| the items that we need to actually complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| So with that said, are there any additions to the agenda for tonight, Mr. Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5824)|
| 1:37:12| If it pleases the commission, I'd like to move item 35 to the front of the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| That way all the folks that are here for that can speak at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5843)|
| 1:37:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| We also have, I know I've got, Chris, were you about to approach the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| Go ahead and approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| I've got Rob Ross here in reference to, I think it's item 17 and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5855)|
| 1:37:44| Or 27, I think, and 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| So he's here on his own time, so if we could move him up so if there's any questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| the billings that were discussed at the work session, that could help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| And Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Time permitting, I'd like to add a discussion item just to update the commission on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| bills that have been filed in the Tennessee General Assembly so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Would you please make a note of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| We have two items that have been requested to be moved to the top of the agenda and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5899)|
| 1:38:27| chair is favorable to both of those ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| That's item 27, which it's also got item 28 with it, which was related to paying bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5911)|
| 1:38:39| pertaining to the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| I know there were questions at the work session, just either comments or questions about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| Arnett, Draper, and Hagood bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| I forwarded to commission an email with the details and invited Mr. Frost to come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| So if it pleases this body, I'd like to move that one to the top of the agenda, followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| by item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| I think that one should be, 27 and 28 should be a little bit briefer and 35 I know is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5943)|
| 1:39:10| to require some longer discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| Does that please this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| All in favor of also, we are going to defer, the formal ads are items 35 and 37 as voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5956)|
| 1:39:26| on at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| 37 came from the finance committee, which was a brief update on the, I believe I call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| it the voluntary separation program for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| The finance committee asked for some more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| We also have items 30 and 46, which are going to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| 46 is in the zoning part of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| We also will need to set a public hearing for zoning item 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5989)|
| 1:39:57| That's in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| What I'd like to do is when we get to the zoning meeting is we will vote at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| to set the public hearing for a date in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6001)|
| 1:40:08| Commissioner Carringer, I see your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| Yes, I wanted to check with Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| We have a resolution for wear red for women, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| So Evelyn and the mayor and I would like to add a resolution because we always do it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6018)|
| 1:40:27| the first day of February, but because of the weather and several commissioners going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| to be at Pellissippi if the weather is okay that morning, we'd like to add our resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| on for February being wear red for women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| Thank you commissioners, all of y'all that got the little memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| It looks like everybody did well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| So just to clarify the resolution, you'd like to have the February commission meeting, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| the work session, be a go red for women meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| Is that to confirm your intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| Yes, Commissioner Gill, we're already wearing some red tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| I'll clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6066)|

| 1:41:14| And the mayor has put together a resolution while we are all here tonight to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| February 1st, and the month of February is the American Heart Association month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| But the date is actually February 1st, and we want to do the resolution with a photo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| so we need to have it added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| Okay, all right, so we will add to the agenda to pass a resolution proclaiming February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6093)|
| 1:41:41| is go red for women month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6101)|

| 1:43:21| On page 7, this is item number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| Did we do Education Consent a while ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| Are we going to do Education Consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| Well, I'd like to get, I know we've got Bob Frost here and we've also got, yeah, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6216)|
| 1:43:43| going to go ahead and do that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Read number 27, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee approving the payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| of attorney fees to counsel representing the individual and class defendants in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| amount of $97,500, the mediator fee in the amount of $3,150, court costs in the estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6237)|
| 1:44:06| amount of $2,251, and Knox County's outside counsel, Arnett Draper and Hagood LLP in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6246)|
| 1:44:15| amount of $48,895.20, all related to the lawsuit styled Knox County, Tennessee v.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| Knox County Retirement and Pension Board at Al Knox County Chancellory Court, docket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| number 195629-1 from account number, this is resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6267)|
| 1:44:34| Okay, could I have a motion for approval on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| I have a motion from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| We will not be able to vote on this because there's a blank, but in order to have discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| we need to have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| Was that Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| Okay, so we have a motion for approval by Commissioner Carringer and a second by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| Is there discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6299)|
| 1:45:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| Chris, if you could come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| I guess really the only discussion we need to have is line item, I guess, and we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6314)|
| 1:45:26| a line item transfer that was deferred from previous month in regard to legal fees, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| I guess it really doesn't matter, but I don't want to leave the law director out to dry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| on his other outside lawsuits that are going on, and I believe Davidson and Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6336)|
| 1:45:44| we have some stuff going on there, so I don't want to leave that account out in the dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| So what is your suggestion, Chris, or what is the easiest method for finance to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6349)|
| 1:45:57| I guess what I would recommend would be something like the following, and then I'll defer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6357)|
| 1:46:04| if you all have any questions for Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| I don't want to keep him longer than he and his partner has to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6366)|
| 1:46:12| I think if you take Resolution 27, I would, if it were me, I would divide it into two parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6372)|
| 1:46:19| and I would charge the 97-5, the 31-50, and the 22-51 to our general liability account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6379)|
| 1:46:30| which is 266-0030, and that's the org, the object is 5515-00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6390)|
| 1:46:37| That is an account that is for general liability settlements, so anytime there's a settlement of a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6397)|
| 1:46:47| that's where that gets charged, and so I would charge that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| The law director would instruct Mr. Hauser to add that in origami,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6412)|
| 1:46:58| and we would just pay that from there, and that's an account that we monitor throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| It's an account that is not budgeted by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| It's an internal service fund, and so we can help to rectify that if there are any issues in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| Then I would take the 48-895-20, which is the amount for Arnett, Draper, and Haygood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6434)|
| 1:47:22| and I would charge that to 266-0040-533-100, which is outside legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6442)|
| 1:47:31| That's the account to where once next month we move that to the general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| We've had that discussion, and we've held it for a while, so we would move that to the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| and at that point, you may want, if you want to go ahead and not constrain that budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6461)|
| 1:47:49| because of the cases that are coming up, we could estimate and appropriate at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| whether it be from fund balance or excess revenues, or wait until it gets close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| That's your discretion, but either way, I think we do have some excess currently in sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6480)|
| 1:48:07| that we could estimate and appropriate for that piece, and the other piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| we would just put that set in internal service funds and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| I think from the standpoint of where things should be charged by the categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| that's the correct approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| You definitely have general liability set aside as cases are settled in the 266-0030| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6505)|
| 1:48:34| and the outside legal fees, which would be for what the commission approved for Arnett, Draper, and Haygood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6514)|
| 1:48:41| That's what the other account is used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| Is that okay with the maker of the motion, Carson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| Are the seconds okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| Okay, the chair, we have two lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| I see Commissioner Biggs and Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| I'm not sure, Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| So just to clarify, in layman's terms, how much was pushed over from Buzz's line item transfer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6541)|
| 1:49:13| So the line item transfer that's been in question has not been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| and so that would move the entire amount from 266 to 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| So that's not been done yet, and so this is just charging out to where those currently are budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| and so this commission has to take action on getting that according to the charter over to 101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6570)|
| 1:49:38| but we have deferred that until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| So do we know, and we have no idea what the litigation is going to cost from Nashville and Chattanooga, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| I think his point was to that last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| There's two big cases that are pending that I believe are federal cases, because I know about those a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6593)|
| 1:50:00| and so I believe he doesn't want to be handcuffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| and so the point being is when we move those over to 101, that would be the time to estimate and appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6605)|
| 1:50:12| What has the law director already paid for his outside legal counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| In that fund currently, excuse me, in that account currently, I think the total expenses are about $180,000, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6617)|
| 1:50:27| Jill could probably give me the exact penny, but I think it's about right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| and so that's what's in 266-0040, which we will transfer the budget and then have to transfer the expenses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6632)|
| 1:50:40| All right, I'll come back in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| Mr. Caldwell, when the commission back in, I guess it was November, agreed to hire a law firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6648)|
| 1:50:57| was it your understanding that we would need three attorneys to represent Knox County at a settlement hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6657)|
| 1:51:05| So I believe what we did is when this commission approved the law firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6665)|
| 1:51:12| we sat down with them to go over what their best course of action was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| and so they each went forward with a reduced rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| and thought it was best to give the majority of the work, I think, to the lower paid of the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| and then do that work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| But I think they would tell you, and I don't want to speak for Rob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| I think he would tell you that the volume of the work is what led to the number of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6694)|
| 1:51:43| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| Commissioner is Rob Frost, my office address is 800 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| I'm happy to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| Thank you all for taking this up early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| I'm a mentor in the Tennessee Promise Program, and I have mentor training at 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6715)|
| 1:52:01| What commission approved Commissioner Skinmaker, and I realize you all have passed a lot since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| was the hourly rate for three attorneys in the firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| Paul Wehmeyer in my office is the junior attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6731)|
| 1:52:16| and we're here as a courtesy to commission today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| But we always believe, no matter who the client is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| that if we have someone in our office that can charge at a lower rate and do an adequate job on the file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6745)|
| 1:52:34| we ask that person to step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| So Mr. Wehmeyer was definitely involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| He had a good number of hours on this going over issues that he was able to handle economically for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6760)|
| 1:52:50| Okay, so he got the 42 hours, Mr. Mater got 42 hours and change, and you got the 49 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6770)|
| 1:53:01| If that's what's reflected in our statement, then yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| Okay, so the two most expensive attorneys got the most hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6785)|
| 1:53:11| Well, Mr. Wehmeyer, there was not a reason for Mr. Wehmeyer to attend the mediation in the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| So there was additional time that Mr. Mater and I had because we attended the mediation, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6797)|
| 1:53:32| Are you good, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| I just want to make a point about the way I want to vote here, too, on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| Since this board decided not to follow some of the ruling that Judge Weaver did on July 20th that was filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6824)|
| 1:53:55| and went ahead and did without really thinking about it, causing us to have to go out and get a lawyer to represent us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6835)|
| 1:54:04| since the law director was duly elected by the people to represent us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| and you know my feeling about this settlement, and I'm not going to litigate it anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6848)|
| 1:54:15| and I do believe that this commission did break some of the charters that we held and swore to it we'd uphold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6855)|
| 1:54:28| That's my belief, that's my study, but that July 20th resolution that was filed and given to the litigants was very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6868)|
| 1:54:39| and we just disregarded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| So, therefore, my vote on this is going to be no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| and I just want to let the taxpayers know that this $97,000 and some of these, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6886)|
| 1:54:54| the ones we're paying for Haygood and all like that could have been done away with if we had waited for the November 12th ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6894)|
| 1:55:03| So, I wish I could stand with the rest of y'all, but I can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6903)|
| 1:55:10| because if y'all decided to do something on your own that costs the taxpayers more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6910)|
| 1:55:18| and, well, anyway, it's y'all's decision. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| And then I know we'll want to clarify the motion specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| Commissioner Bussler, that's a matter of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| There are some of us that felt that the best way moving forward was to pause and try to find common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6940)|
| 1:55:49| I believe we had to hire outside counsel to mitigate and go over the billing because our law director was conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6949)|
| 1:55:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| I was asked to leave the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| And I won't be commenting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| You can ask your counsel to advise you in these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| Seeing no other lights, I want to clarify the resolution that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| A proper motion and second has been done on this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| Mr. Caldwell has clarified which lines based on the business practice of the county finance department this bill should come out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=6989)|
| 1:56:40| To clarify, now, the motion was made, was that Daly and Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| Excuse me, Carringer and Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| So what I'd like to do is just to get pure clarification on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| Is it the intent of those making this motion to follow through on the recommendations of the finance department on this particular motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7017)|
| 1:57:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| So that motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| Madam Clerk, I'd like to have a pass on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| Madam Clerk, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| Item number 28, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7059)|
| 1:57:44| authorizing the reimbursement of attorney fees previously paid by current or former employees of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7064)|
| 1:57:50| as shown on the attached list and in the total amount of $17,562.60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7070)|
| 1:57:57| and the lawsuit style Knox County, Tennessee v. Knox County Retirement and Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| The motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| That came to our meeting today from the work session with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7090)|
| 1:58:17| Do I have a motion for approval on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7102)|
| 1:58:23| A motion to approve has been made by Commissioner Anders and seconded by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| This motion has a blank in it similar to the last motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| I'm going to recognize Finance Leader Caldwell to talk to this as far as a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7111)|
| 1:58:39| This one came forward through the mediation and we chose to reimburse the current and former employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7119)|
| 1:58:47| and so I do believe that this one would go into that same settlement lineup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| which would be 2660030 and then object code 551500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7132)|
| 1:59:00| and we would work with Evan to get that amount along with the other amount in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| and that would be an origami as part of the settlement, and that's where I think it should be charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7145)|
| 1:59:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| That motion is to clarify the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| The motion on the floor was to pay this, and in the spot marked blank on your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7158)|
| 1:59:25| to utilize the codes and accounts that Mr. Caldwell has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| I see Commissioner Busler's mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| He said this was done in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| Was this attached to the original settlement that we looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7180)|
| 1:59:46| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| I think this came out of the mediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| That's to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| So this is not part of the settlement then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| I believe that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| This is attorney fees of employees that had already hired an attorney prior to the class action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7197)|
| 2:00:07| So in paying these attorney's fees, isn't that kind of setting precedent that we're going down the wrong road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7207)|
| 2:00:17| we're going down a slippery slope from now on out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| Would people that have hired attorneys outside the law department can get reimbursed for their lawyers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7220)|
| 2:00:31| Just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7231)|
| 2:00:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| Commissioner Busler, are you talking about for other Knox County employees the precedent you're setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7236)|
| 2:00:44| or are you just specifically speaking of these individuals who put their life on the line every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7244)|
| 2:00:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| The chair recognizes you've asked a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| What I would prefer is just to keep everything civil, address the questions to the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| and the chair will recognize the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| The chair now recognizes your question, and the chair recognizes Commissioner Busler to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| I'm not questioning the people that risk their lives every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7271)|
| 2:01:17| I'm questioning the action that we're taking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| Are retired employees still employees of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7281)|
| 2:01:28| There was a legal question that was asked by Chancellor Weaver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7288)|
| 2:01:36| saying, one, that this was a question of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| And I was wondering what that question of law was that we didn't want answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| And here we are, that an employee can retire and then hire another attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7304)|
| 2:01:52| and then we go and pay for that attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| And I'm not sure if that's not a precedent set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| Are you still an employee when you retire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| Were they employees or were they retirees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| And this can bleed over into other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| I'm not questioning their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| I'm not questioning anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| I'm questioning the action of this board by paying it the way we're paying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| Okay, seeing no other lights, I want to clarify the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| Once again, the motion on the table is to approve this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7358)|
| 2:02:45| and to utilize the codes that our finance leader, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7365)|
| 2:02:51| recommended based on practice in the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| I now recognize a light from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| I just wanted to read out that it's consideration of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7379)|
| 2:03:06| of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| authorizing the reimbursement of attorney's fees previously paid by current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7388)|
| 2:03:16| or former employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7396)|
| 2:03:23| Thank you for that clarification, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| Once again, the motion before us is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| It's been restated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| Seeing no other discussion lights, the chair will entertain a vote on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7412)|
| 2:03:37| All in favor of this item, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| Madam Clerk, I would pass, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7424)|
| 2:03:48| All right, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7431)|
| 2:03:58| On page 9, this is item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7438)|
| 2:04:06| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| expressing support of the Tennessee General Assembly's ongoing effort to eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| any requirement of a comprehensive growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| either by statewide legislation or by specific exemption from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7458)|
| 2:04:23| This is resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| All right, there's been a lot of attention to this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| and I want to be clear at the very beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| I know there was quite a few folks who wanted to speak to this on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| I also knew that the mayor had expressed an interest to speaking to this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| So what I would like to follow through on is that commitment to give this item an opportunity at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7484)|
| 2:04:52| But quickly, before I move to that, I notice Commissioner Daley's light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| Out of courtesy, could we read the consent calendar for the schools so they can leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7497)|
| 2:05:02| I mean, it's not very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7503)|

| 2:07:57| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Is there a motion to approve the school's consent calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| It was moved by Commissioner Carringer and seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| I'd like to ask the schools if they've got anything they want to say before they leave, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| If not, they're dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| The only topic that came up that was actually a result of the Finance Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7706)|
| 2:08:33| Mr. Thomas, would you mind coming down, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| As a follow-up from our Finance Committee meeting last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| one of the items that was not, I guess, fully deep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| there was not a deep dive on the success or the numbers on the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| that had accepted the retirement buyouts, that voluntary separation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| So Finance recommended to add that as a discussion item for tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| and we voted to add that on our agenda earlier this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| So this is an opportunity, before you all are dismissed, because of the meeting, not because of the snow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7747)|
| 2:09:13| but to provide this Commission an update on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| Of course, Bob Thomas, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| Friday was the last day to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| I think we had seven individuals to withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| so I believe the number is right at 221 folks who've actually accepted the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| Roughly about 130 to 135 teachers out of that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| and it's probably slightly less than 100 more than we normally have in terms of retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7781)|
| 2:09:47| So there have been some principals to accept and some assistant principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| and some system-wide individuals and then some individuals at the central office as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| Total is around 221.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| All right. Around 221?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| In its entirety, the number in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| All right. Are there any questions on this item for Superintendent Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7807)|
| 2:10:13| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| Thanks, sir. Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| Okay. Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7820)|
| 2:10:29| Okay. I'm going to ask Madam Clerk to go ahead and reread Item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7829)|
| 2:10:39| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| expressing support of the Tennessee General Assembly's ongoing effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| to eliminate any requirement for the Comprehensive Growth Policy Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| either by statewide legislation or by specific exemption for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| This is Resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7856)|
| 2:10:59| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| As Chairman, I'm going to have a little bit of Chairman's discretion on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7861)|
| 2:11:05| and reference that last week's work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| Talk just for a minute or two about how we got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| and then I'm going to invite everybody to speak before Commission does a little bit of debate on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| For the last couple of years, from when I was a new Commissioner, kind of like Mr. Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| to now it seems as if one thing that I heard consistently at multiple meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7882)|
| 2:11:27| by more senior Commissioners and even folks at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| was an awful lot of frustration with our growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| and how it hadn't been updated in almost 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| And it's been a very consistent theme that's been talked about in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7899)|
| 2:11:45| at our work sessions, it's been talked about at Commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| it's been talked about every time we do zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| It's something that we've talked about at, I'm not going to say every single meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7910)|
| 2:11:55| but almost every single meeting when we come to trying to work on zoning issues for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7915)|
| 2:12:02| I guess you could say it's kind of come to a head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| And with all the good feedback that we've gotten from the community, from everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7925)|
| 2:12:12| this sounds crazy, but I'm glad to have a lot of folks here to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| We had a very good luncheon last week where we talked about this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| And one interesting thing that came out of the work session last week was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| and some of us did make a little light of it because it was kind of funny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| it was Commissioner Bussler said to Gerald Greene, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| you know, Mr. Greene, this is the first time you and I have ever agreed on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| And the thing that they agreed on was that we need new planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7960)|
| 2:12:47| I remember Commissioner Bussler saying specifically we need to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| that we've got folks in the communities involved in planning their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| I remember at the work session Commissioner Anders saying specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| how we'd like to do cluster developments in different parts of town that are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| I've heard from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| We've got two commissioners who've come up in their community service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| through neighborhood groups in Daly and Schoonmaker who would like to see new planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| I just handed the planning documents that I read last week at this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| some copies to Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| It's been consistent that, gosh, I think everybody wants new planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8002)|
| 2:13:28| I haven't heard anybody say that we don't want to do planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| I've heard lots of folks say that there's different paths to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| We need to update the general plan. We need to do a growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| We need to keep what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| Even the folks who, frankly, many of you folks have even sent us e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| and they've all been different about what we need to do to fix or to try to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| If there's one thing that is consistent, it's that we all agree that we need planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| and if there's another thing that's consistent, it's there's no consensus on how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| Also, I think one thing that, just as a side note, as chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8045)|
| 2:14:10| part of my role is to help set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8050)|
| 2:14:13| I think somebody called me today and said, folks out there, they're saying that this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8053)|
| 2:14:17| that you're trying to push down the highway on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| Well, when we're requested by our state legislature who are trying to help us fix this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8061)|
| 2:14:26| and when they ask us to try and get a resolution passed, as your chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8066)|
| 2:14:31| part of my role is to go ahead and put that on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| Just because I'm the sponsor on this doesn't mean that Hugh Nystrom is out trying to push this down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8074)|
| 2:14:39| the whole community's throats on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8079)|
| 2:14:42| We all have our roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| In fact, if I hadn't put that on the agenda, we wouldn't have had all this discussion come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| and I think some of this energy that we're all feeling might not have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| Twenty years ago when this first came up, all the energy was around annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8093)|
| 2:14:59| but now as our county has grown, all the energy on this subject matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| is around pure planning and infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| And those are some of the things I think that we all agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| and I'm glad to have a lot of folks here to talk about this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8110)|
| 2:15:16| So I kind of wanted to lay the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| I also want to, some of the folks who are here tonight but who weren't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| at the work session for county commission, I read the first part of the state document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| that provides an overview of the comprehensive growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| We read a summary of the law that was passed in 2013 around annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8131)|
| 2:15:36| So while the commission's been briefed on some of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| that was something that we spent a lot of time digging into at last week's work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8140)|
| 2:15:44| just talking about in a way how we got here and have to follow up lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| and that was sunshined at Litton's last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| So laying the land, now what I'd like to do is ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8152)|
| 2:15:57| we've got a lot of folks who've lined up and have requested to speak on this subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| I will say that if this goes on for a while, everyone's going to get five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8160)|
| 2:16:06| we have a zoning meeting, somewhat ironic, at 7 o'clock, which is always scheduled at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8166)|
| 2:16:13| If there is anything we need to come back to, the way that this meeting will run is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| and I'm saying this for my fellow commissioners as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| is this commission will run according to our set agenda until 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8180)|
| 2:16:26| If we finish by 7, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| If we don't, we will open the zoning meeting, we will take a recess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| we'll open the zoning meeting at 7 and then come back to finish the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| So, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| Now, what I'd like to do, Mayor Jacobs had requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| he was one of the first folks to request to speak at public forum on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| I'm going to go ahead and invite Mayor Jacobs to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| Mayor Jacobs, you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| And then I have Mary English, Kevin Murphy, Arthur Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8210)|
| 2:16:55| Louise Pavlin, Sandra Karbiak, sorry Sandra, I did a bad job on your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8215)|
| 2:17:01| and Janice from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| So, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| Thank you for this time, and I would like to recognize all of my fellow citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| who are here to speak to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| They have obviously invested a lot of time and effort in becoming very informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| and educated about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| Knox County is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| Knox County is strong because of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| Folks just like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| And although we may sometimes differ on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| I appreciate them and thank them for being here tonight to make their voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| So, thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| In my opinion, the Knoxville-Farragut-Knox County Growth Policy Plan is obsolete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8257)|
| 2:17:41| no longer necessary, and instead of helping plan for growth in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8261)|
| 2:17:46| has become an obstacle for good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| The plan was created and implemented in the early 2000s, nearly 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| and was designed in large part to deal with forced annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| A lot has changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| Rural areas are no longer rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| The city is overhauling its zoning and coding policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| And forced annexation, as you referenced, is no longer an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| We need planning tools that will help Knox County deal with circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| as they now stand and as they will unfold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| We need a 21st century plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| We also need a plan that encourages retail commercial development in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| so that we can maximize our local sales tax option revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8305)|
| 2:18:29| None of us want to be in a situation where a tax hike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| or a tax rate increase is the only option to meeting our budgetary demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8312)|
| 2:18:38| By encouraging sales tax revenue growth, we hopefully can help avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8318)|
| 2:18:43| But we don't need a plan solely for the sake of having another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| Regulatory mazes and unnecessary levels of bureaucracy will destroy our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| to compete with neighboring and regional municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| My office's recommendation is to incorporate the pertinent elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8336)|
| 2:19:00| of an updated general plan, eliminate the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| and update our sector plans so that they are in harmony with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8344)|
| 2:19:09| Instead of creating more layers of bureaucracy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| we need to peel back the ones we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| And also, while we're talking about planning, as an aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| I wanted to mention that last week during the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| it was brought up that commissions should develop a list of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| that you would like to see, all of you, in your various districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| and commissions should then work to prioritize this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8366)|
| 2:19:28| I'd really like to see this body do that, preferably as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| Of course, because of budgetary constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| and I cannot make any guarantees about funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| but nevertheless I think it would be beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| and would spur all of us to think a little more deeply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| about where we want our county to go and how we're going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| Thank you again for allowing me this time. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| Next we have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| I've got a question for Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| Sorry, we've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| Sorry, go ahead, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8398)|
| 2:19:59| Last year we funded, or in the budget they were going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| a county-wide transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| Has that been released, or has that been continued, or is it ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| Where's that at, Chris, or Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8409)|
| 2:20:17| And also, I guess, Mayor, they're going to need us and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| to fund, obviously, a new general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| and so we'll have to make that commitment, not financially or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| but we need to make that commitment to them that we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| Yes, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| Jim Stone, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| There was a study in the budget last year for the Hardin Valley area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| but as far as an overall county general plan, there was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| However, after the conversation last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8442)|
| 2:20:45| I started talking with Jeff Welch at the TPO and Mr. Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| to possibly make an expenditure for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| to essentially mimic that plan county-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| for a county-wide mobility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| But there isn't one in the budget for pre-existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| I thought that, Dwight Van de Velde,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| I thought last year during budget time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| or during we were having this, imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| a conversation about transportation and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| we had this conversation that that was going to be a priority list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| was going to be recreated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| Yeah, what Mr. Caldwell was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| and it may be we did receive about $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8476)|
| 2:21:20| for a payment management system budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| What that is is we'll assess the road condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8484)|
| 2:21:28| of all the roads in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| but that's just essentially looking at the condition of the surface itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| and not the capacity and safety of the roads themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| Am I mistaken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| Did we not have a conversation about that last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| You don't remember it, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| I don't know, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| If I may, Commissioner, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| Chris and I had a discussion today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| about putting that into this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| a comprehensive road plan to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| how we can help ensure that we're maximizing our economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8514)|
| 2:21:59| So we'll be looking at that this year for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8524)|
| 2:22:05| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8525)|
| 2:22:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| I'm glad to hear that you incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| that we need to have a conversation about each commissioner's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| and the priorities long and short term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| and some of those priorities that we just need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8540)|
| 2:22:24| a broader outline and conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| because most of our districts need to be connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| and some of those priorities can best be reflected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| by having a constituent conversation on behalf of the entire county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8553)|
| 2:22:39| to have a better vision for the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| All right, thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| All right, Mayor Jacobs, anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| No, thank you all very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| Okay, Mary English?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8571)|
| 2:23:02| My name is Mary English, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| I have a cold that I'm getting over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| so I hope that you'll be able to understand me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| My address is 810 Oak Grove Lane, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8591)|
| 2:23:18| And I'm here as the land use chair of the League of Women Voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| I'm speaking on behalf of both the League and its president, Linda McCabe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| Basically what we want you to do is to think twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8613)|
| 2:23:39| before trying to ditch the Knox County Growth Policy Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8619)|
| 2:23:46| not as it is now, but as it could be if it's updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8626)|
| 2:23:52| Now I'm going to give a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| Full disclosure, I was involved in the creation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| what's now called Chapter 1101, first to when it was enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8641)|
| 2:24:08| So I have some history that I would like to bring to bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| It's true that the biggest trigger for BC-1101 was rampant annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8653)|
| 2:24:21| and it is also true that it's a problem that's now been dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| But when that act was passed, it was not just about unchecked annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8666)|
| 2:24:33| It was also about unchecked sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8673)|
| 2:24:37| So a key purpose of the act, and one that continues to be important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8677)|
| 2:24:43| is to promote compact, contiguous growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| Among other things, this will save money for public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| A second key purpose is to protect local natural resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8695)|
| 2:25:02| resources like prime farmland, which if lost now will be gone forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8702)|
| 2:25:10| Now these two purposes, to promote efficient growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8710)|
| 2:25:16| while protecting invaluable resources, they remain vital for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8716)|
| 2:25:23| And achieving these purposes requires the intergovernmental planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8723)|
| 2:25:29| that's mandated in BC-1101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| In other words, it requires that the county and the city governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8733)|
| 2:25:38| work hand-in-hand on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| The Knox County Growth Plan was adopted in 2001, hasn't been amended since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8743)|
| 2:25:50| It's overdue for an amendment, and it may have been delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8750)|
| 2:25:55| because it's not an easy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8755)|
| 2:25:58| An amended growth plan requires virtually the same procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8758)|
| 2:26:03| as those used for the original plan, and those procedures are demanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| They require a lot of intergovernmental coordination, public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| data analysis, as well as approval by the state's local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8774)|
| 2:26:20| planning advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8780)|
| 2:26:23| So it's complicated, but that is a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8783)|
| 2:26:27| because growth in Knox County affects us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| So not having, finally, last words, not having an approved growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8791)|
| 2:26:38| would also affect us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8798)|
| 2:26:41| It has intangible sprawl, has intangible costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8801)|
| 2:26:48| as well as tangible costs, and they affect each of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8808)|
| 2:26:52| But in addition, and I hope you realize this, that according to the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8812)|
| 2:26:58| as it's now written, Chapter 1101, the county stands to lose free money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8818)|
| 2:27:07| if it doesn't have an approved growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| It won't be eligible for many state-managed grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8831)|
| 2:27:17| such as for transportation, housing, community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8837)|
| 2:27:23| and industrial infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| So think carefully about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Thank you, Ms. English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8852)|
| 2:27:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| You get a five-for-one deal with me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8865)|
| 2:27:48| I'm here representing, been asked to speak on behalf of the French Broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| Preservation Association, Hardin Valley Planning Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| Northeast Knox Preservation Association, the North Shore Corridor Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| and Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| We do thank you for your time on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| and I know that you've spent a lot of time on the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| A lot of you were at the meeting last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| and I think we've all learned a lot, so it's been a very valuable discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8889)|
| 2:28:14| Our groups have been looking at this closer, and besides annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8894)|
| 2:28:19| the growth policy plan also impacts density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| the long-range vision of our urban and rural areas of the county, schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8902)|
| 2:28:28| infrastructure with our transportation, our utilities, electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| And, you know, of course we've got issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8913)|
| 2:28:37| The planners have issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| The developers have issues with it because the plan was adopted 19 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| If you had a kid born on the day that the plan was enacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| they'd be in their last semester of high school right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| and you wouldn't expect the plans that you made for them on the day they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| born to still be valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| So, you know, that's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| We all learn and we all grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| I really think that the growth policy plan, that's what it needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| It's time to update it to be useful and not just throw it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| I do understand why some people want to chuck it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| You know, it provides some guardrails that a few folks don't want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8947)|
| 2:29:12| especially around density, and it also says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| what areas we should try and reserve for future agriculture and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| which is part of our heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| But if you throw all this out, it negates the input that thousands of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8960)|
| 2:29:25| have had in the planning process, both from this and the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8965)|
| 2:29:29| and the sector plans, as well as tens of thousands of hours that have been put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8969)|
| 2:29:34| So we firmly believe that the best approach is to actually update the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| The hard part was back in 2000 when we created this plan from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| But if we want to make some minor common sense updates, that shouldn't be terribly difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8983)|
| 2:29:50| Tennessee Code does tell us exactly how to start it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| The commission simply has to propose an amendment to the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8993)|
| 2:29:56| file a notice with the county mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| and the county mayor then reconvenes or reestablishes the coordinating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| to consider the proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| We strongly feel that asking it in the legislature to get rid of the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| for Knox County has a lot of significant implications that ripple out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9011)|
| 2:30:16| and are more than annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| Again, they're economic and utility and schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| and maybe that's also a missing element of what our planning has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| is that this is what's supposed to be the long-range, high-level plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9024)|
| 2:30:29| that tied together infrastructure, economic, utilities, and schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9029)|
| 2:30:34| and their growth planning as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| But since it's been stale, everybody's kind of gone their own direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| So to sum it up, the reason this is really perceived as broken is because it hasn't been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9039)|
| 2:30:44| And so we could simply update it and regularly refresh it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| and that puts us all in sync and all working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| Thanks. Y'all still got a minute, almost two minutes, if you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9057)|
| 2:31:00| All right. Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| One of the comments that keeps coming up is updating the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9064)|
| 2:31:07| which I'm not opposed to updating the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| One of the comments, I'm not opposed to updating the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9073)|
| 2:31:17| but we have to have everybody at the table, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| Everybody has to be willing to come to the table in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| We've been told that the city's not coming to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| because they don't feel a need to update the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| The growth, there's this growth through redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| They've done a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| We've partnered with them on pilots and TIFs that have helped out along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| But we can't update this plan by ourselves, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9099)|
| 2:31:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9108)|
| 2:31:49| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9109)|
| 2:31:50| Yeah, along that line, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9110)|
| 2:31:54| the 2020 plan comes up next year or the plan comes up in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9114)|
| 2:31:57| It either can be sunshined and no action taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| or the assembly will, I guess, extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9124)|
| 2:32:05| It's whatever the state legislature deems at that point in time they will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9125)|
| 2:32:09| I don't know what they will do in terms of the actual statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9129)|
| 2:32:15| Some of the, I think I used the word the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| the conundrum that we have as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9138)|
| 2:32:21| is that the optional part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9141)|
| 2:32:27| as far as Knox County, Farragut, and the city of Knoxville is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| sunset on December 31, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9151)|
| 2:32:35| The mandamus part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| which is the designated areas that keeps you in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9157)|
| 2:32:41| which is the urban growth, the urban area, the growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9161)|
| 2:32:46| and the rural area as designated is still in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9166)|
| 2:32:51| But we don't have a plan plan associated with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| because the things that we're talking about and that we debate over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| is the variable part of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| And Knox County and the city of Farragut and the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| said that we will keep this enforced until this date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9185)|
| 2:33:10| And the variable part, sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9190)|
| 2:33:13| We have the areas, and now we have no way to annex within those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9193)|
| 2:33:19| So we have an issue as to how our community wants to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9199)|
| 2:33:25| with the planning of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9205)|
| 2:33:29| I think that's what this board is trying to get a handle on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| is how do we plan in the growth area and the rural area going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9213)|
| 2:33:41| when there's no incentive, as Commissioner Anders said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9221)|
| 2:33:46| for the other two partners to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| And when you're talking about getting rid of the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9230)|
| 2:33:55| you can keep the growth plan as you have it as it's sunset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| and have the designated areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| but we need to have some planning within those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| I think is what you all are trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9243)|
| 2:34:06| Now how you get there, there's a lot of legal ways to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| but that's a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| Just for clarification, if it's extended by the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9253)|
| 2:34:18| will the city and the town of Farragut have to come to the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9258)|
| 2:34:24| If it's extended, we still have the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9264)|
| 2:34:28| which designates the areas which is the mandatory part of the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9268)|
| 2:34:33| and we are in compliance with that part of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9273)|
| 2:34:37| If they don't want to come to the table, it's that planning piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| that was just presented here a moment ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9281)|
| 2:34:46| that we don't have any teeth in anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9286)|
| 2:34:50| because of the sunset clause that the three parties wrote in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9290)|
| 2:34:55| What I believe I'm hearing commission say is if all else fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9295)|
| 2:35:00| we need to get rid of the whole thing so we can have a plan for our lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9300)|
| 2:35:06| Or if we do stay with it, we need to have the power, meaning Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| to plan under the urban growth plan for these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| That's what I think I hear you all saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| Those are all policy decisions, but as far as compliance with the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| you're in compliance with the law at this very moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| but you don't have any zoning, planning teeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9326)|
| 2:35:31| associated with the areas that you've set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| That's where the void is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| and that's what I think the community is saying we need to get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| even though they may think they still have something, but we really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9342)|
| 2:35:47| I think everybody in this room is saying the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| It's a matter of how do you get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| and that's a policy thing for commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| and it's a policy thing for our community and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9358)|
| 2:35:59| I'd like to get back to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| If it pleases our two lights, I said at the beginning of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9363)|
| 2:36:07| that I would try to follow the public forum format here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| What I would like to do is we have one, two, three, four more folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9371)|
| 2:36:16| Arthur Seymour has requested to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9376)|
| 2:36:20| I thought I saw him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9380)|
| 2:36:21| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9381)|
| 2:36:30| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9394)|
| 2:36:38| I was involved with the enactment of the Urban Growth Policy Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9398)|
| 2:36:44| as well as implementation of it being on the airport authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9404)|
| 2:36:50| Blount County had to implement it and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9410)|
| 2:36:56| Let me tell you, the purpose of the plan was simply to stop unchecked annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9416)|
| 2:37:05| A good friend of mine who was mayor for 16 years of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9425)|
| 2:37:12| had found out a unique way to annex properties, finger annexations, spot annexations, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9432)|
| 2:37:22| The law was really designed to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| It was emulated by other municipalities in the implementation of annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9446)|
| 2:37:34| Since then, the legislature has prohibited annexation except for very limited reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9454)|
| 2:37:43| One, the landowner basically requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| But the purpose of the plan has gone away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9467)|
| 2:37:52| Now, Knox County's plan or the Urban Growth Policy Plan Commission or committee set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9472)|
| 2:38:00| was supposed to meet every three years to update the plan after it was implemented in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9480)|
| 2:38:08| It has not met once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9488)|
| 2:38:11| The committee has dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9491)|
| 2:38:13| I don't know whether all of the members still live in Knox County, but it has hampered growth in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9493)|
| 2:38:24| Let me cite the example of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| Twenty years ago, was Hardin Valley Road thought of as a major center for development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| I don't think so, and it is one of those today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9514)|
| 2:38:39| But you cannot anticipate something that you lock into a plan for actually 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9519)|
| 2:38:51| So I recommend to Knox County that it follow through with the state legislators to abolish this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9531)|
| 2:39:02| We have in Knox County planning at multiple layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9542)|
| 2:39:08| The city has a general plan, a one-year plan, and the county has a general plan and sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9548)|
| 2:39:16| I don't think we need any more layers on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| Farragut, by the way, has very careful planning in its municipal limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9560)|
| 2:39:29| So I think it is time to get rid of the growth policy plan, which hampers our growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9569)|
| 2:39:37| and hampers future development of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9577)|
| 2:39:42| We've got plenty of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| We don't need any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| All right, thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| Okay, Louise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9591)|
| 2:39:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9599)|
| 2:40:00| Louise Poblin, Vice Mayor, Town of Farragut, 11408 Municipal Drive, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9600)|
| 2:40:06| Chairman Nystrom, I appreciate the opportunity to address you and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| Although one of the initial goals in establishing Public Chapter 1101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| was to address the many battles that existed at the time regarding annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| and incorporation of new municipalities, say that three times fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9619)|
| 2:40:24| it served an overall broader goal of establishing a framework under which the county commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9624)|
| 2:40:30| and the governing bodies of the municipalities within the county communicated with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9630)|
| 2:40:35| and developed an overall growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| In addition to convening a coordinating committee made up of representatives from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9638)|
| 2:40:42| the municipalities, utilities, school district, Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9642)|
| 2:40:46| and various other entities to develop a growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9646)|
| 2:40:49| Public Chapter 1101 required the establishment of a joint economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9649)|
| 2:40:54| and community development board for the purpose of fostering communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| with regard to economic and community development between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9658)|
| 2:41:01| and among governmental entities, industry, and private citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| One concern in exempting Knox County from Public Chapter 1101 would be the lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9666)|
| 2:41:10| of requirement for a formal framework to connect and coordinate with each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9670)|
| 2:41:14| through the joint economic and community development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| Farragut's mayor serves as a non-voting member on the board for the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9677)|
| 2:41:22| of Knox County and a voting member of the joint economic and community development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9682)|
| 2:41:27| This relationship between the mayors of Knox County, the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| and Farragut is important for the growth of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9690)|
| 2:41:33| and the lack of a formal policy to maintain it may compromise its current structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9693)|
| 2:41:38| Without that structure, the eligibility to receive certain grants from the Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9698)|
| 2:41:42| of Economic and Community Development could also be compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9702)|
| 2:41:46| For these reasons, the Town of Farragut Board of Mayor and Aldermen requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9706)|
| 2:41:50| the Knox County Commission withdraw from consideration the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| to support the elimination of any requirement for a comprehensive growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| either by statewide legislation or by specific exemption for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9718)|
| 2:42:02| Public Chapter 1101 provides for the ability to amend the growth plan as set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| in Tennessee Code Annotated Section 658-104D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9727)|
| 2:42:13| Specifically, file a notice to propose an amendment and reestablish a coordinating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9733)|
| 2:42:17| which would follow the same procedures that were used to establish the original plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9737)|
| 2:42:21| A lot has changed in Knox County, the City of Knoxville, and the Town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9741)|
| 2:42:25| since the original adoption of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| These growth plans should be amended with public input based on the changing development patterns of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9748)|
| 2:42:34| If Knox County determines the growth plan needs to be adjusted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| now would be the appropriate time to reconvene a coordinating committee to update the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| I've got a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| You're speaking as one of the leaders of the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| One of the biggest challenges that we've had is getting everybody together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9771)|
| 2:42:58| I'm just making an observation, and I don't know if you all passed a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9778)|
| 2:43:03| or if you're speaking for the Town of Farragut, either in your elected or professional capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9783)|
| 2:43:08| but what you're saying is the Town of Farragut would be open to coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9788)|
| 2:43:16| It's my belief that we've never been able to get the coordinating committee together, ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9796)|
| 2:43:23| or at least it's never been a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| Just to clarify, what you're saying is, in layman's words, Farragut would want to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9805)|
| 2:43:32| Yes. I would be very interested, certainly from a personal standpoint as an elected representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9812)|
| 2:43:39| What happens in northwest Knox County, what happens in southwest Knox County, certainly impacts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9819)|
| 2:43:46| We're seeing the impacts specifically from southwest Knox County growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9826)|
| 2:43:51| in what we've had to do for our transportation network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| Certainly we're seeing some impact as the development in northwest Knox County happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9835)|
| 2:44:01| It is important for us to be a partner in developing that growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9841)|
| 2:44:06| You talked last week about connecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9846)|
| 2:44:11| Commissioner Jay had that project that he was talking about in North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9851)|
| 2:44:16| You connect into, on Concord Road, that portion, they're connected into Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9856)|
| 2:44:21| That excites me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| Connecting the Town of Farragut and what we have to offer with the surrounding communities is important from a pedestrian point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9863)|
| 2:44:30| Certainly from a transportation traffic road point of view, that's important as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9870)|
| 2:44:35| So, yes, we are very much interested in being part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9875)|
| 2:44:39| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9885)|
| 2:44:46| Could you give the list of people that represent each municipality in the capacity on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9886)|
| 2:44:53| The list of, oh, I had another sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9893)|
| 2:44:58| It's representatives from the county, municipalities, utilities, school district, Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9898)|
| 2:45:05| and it had a soil expert, they had various other entities for environmental concerns, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9905)|
| 2:45:12| I don't have it off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| How many elected officials is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| I don't know if it had to be elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| I think if it was representatives of the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9919)|
| 2:45:24| I wasn't clear that it was required to be elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| I think that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9927)|
| 2:45:28| The Alderman of Farragut wouldn't be the people serving on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9928)|
| 2:45:33| Whenever you talk about the Northwest Corridor and how it influences Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9933)|
| 2:45:38| would Farragut be willing to let us do what we want in our section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9938)|
| 2:45:43| You have that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9943)|
| 2:45:46| Well, that's not covered by Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9946)|
| 2:45:49| No, but you all would have to approve anything we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9949)|
| 2:45:53| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9953)|
| 2:45:54| I have to say personally I have no interest in telling you what you can do in southwest Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9954)|
| 2:46:02| or what you can do in northwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| I would like to be part of the process, or we would like to be part of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9964)|
| 2:46:09| to understand what that impact, the potential impact would be for what we need to be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9969)|
| 2:46:17| For instance, we're seeing a lot of growth on Snyder Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| You guys approved an apartment complex that was 18 units, 20 units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9980)|
| 2:46:27| I believe it was 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| We're seeing a lot of backup on Snyder Road trying to get onto North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9989)|
| 2:46:37| It took us realizing that way after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=9997)|
| 2:46:40| and we were adding a second lane to the right of way on North Campbell Station Road between Snyder and the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10000)|
| 2:46:46| Now, if this had been a conversation we've had, we would have seen that sooner and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10006)|
| 2:46:52| oh, we need to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10012)|
| 2:46:53| It's a simple project, $250,000 project, which with road projects, that's relatively cheap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10013)|
| 2:47:00| and it solves a big problem that we're having up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| So, yeah, we need to have these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| We can't live in a bubble, but I'm not interested in telling you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| or this board what they can do in a part that doesn't cover town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10030)|
| 2:47:18| You had mentioned the economic development co-op.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10038)|
| 2:47:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| Is that something that could stay intact even without a growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10044)|
| 2:47:28| I'm not clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10048)|
| 2:47:30| The growth plan, the public chapter 1101 designates that as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10050)|
| 2:47:37| That code requires, in section 15 I think it is in the law, it's required to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10057)|
| 2:47:43| If we get rid of all of it, then we're not tied to having this, you know, it's required by law to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10063)|
| 2:47:53| If we exempt ourselves from the law, are we exempting ourselves from the entire law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| Are we exempting ourselves from a portion of the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| Are you still eligible for grants if you've exempted yourself from a portion of the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10083)|
| 2:48:08| There's a lot of questions and the ramifications of which I'm not sure that we have the answers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10088)|
| 2:48:15| So that's my overall concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| I don't know that we as the town are eligible for those grants, but the city of Knoxville is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10098)|
| 2:48:24| so that will certainly bring them to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10104)|
| 2:48:29| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10110)|
| 2:48:31| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10111)|
| 2:48:32| I have the answer to Commissioner Smith's question regarding the coordinating committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| The state of Tennessee mandated that it would be a minimum of 11 with a maximum of 21 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10117)|
| 2:48:44| The document that I posted on the commission forum, the handbook about growth policy, it's on page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10124)|
| 2:48:52| It spells it out that the county mayor serves on that body as well as the mayor of each municipality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10132)|
| 2:48:58| Also, the governing board of the largest municipally owned utility has a seat as well as the non-municipally owned utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10138)|
| 2:49:11| Also, a member from the Soil and Conservation District, also from the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10151)|
| 2:49:17| also a member from the largest chamber in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10157)|
| 2:49:22| and then the county mayor has an opportunity to appoint two members from representing construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10162)|
| 2:49:31| homeowner interests, or environmental groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10171)|
| 2:49:35| And actually then the county mayor can actually appoint two more for the same category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10175)|
| 2:49:41| So there are elected officials on that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10186)|
| 2:49:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10188)|
| 2:49:51| Okay, Sandra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10191)|
| 2:50:00| Hi, thanks for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| I'm short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10203)|
| 2:50:04| I mean, my presentation is short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| If you could say your full name and address for the record, too, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| My name is Sandra Korbelik, 5212 Daphne Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10208)|
| 2:50:14| As I understand, the resolution before the council is to eliminate any requirement for a comprehensive growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10214)|
| 2:50:24| In other words, you're going to eliminate your planning for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| Growth is more than just building and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10228)|
| 2:50:32| Growth creates demand on our infrastructure, our system of providing safety and services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10232)|
| 2:50:38| and in particular in regard to roads, traffic, schools, and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10238)|
| 2:50:43| Growth may generate taxes, but it also costs our community and our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10243)|
| 2:50:50| Growth does not always pay in taxes what it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| Single family, for instance, rarely pays in taxes what it demands in services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10254)|
| 2:51:00| Growth in the wrong location can be very, very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| Planned growth is good and chaotic growth is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10264)|
| 2:51:09| Why am I saying this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10269)|
| 2:51:12| I am a city planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| I have a master's from UCLA in architecture and planning, 37 years of experience, professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10274)|
| 2:51:21| and a member of the American Institute of Certified Planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10281)|
| 2:51:25| I worked in rural communities, rural counties, urban counties, small towns, and large urban cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10285)|
| 2:51:33| And I have to just share with you, it just breaks my heart when I see communities realizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10293)|
| 2:51:40| that unplanned growth has created such a demand in services that they are struggling to keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10300)|
| 2:51:47| with the expense of retrofitting their community to accommodate the demands of the growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10307)|
| 2:51:56| Please don't be in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| What I would like to say is that I know that hindsight is 20-20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10319)|
| 2:52:04| I'd like us to see some foresight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10324)|
| 2:52:07| I don't see how Mr. Nystrom has started the presentation saying that we all agree that we need good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10327)|
| 2:52:17| How can you have good planning if you pass a resolution to do away with the need for a growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10337)|
| 2:52:24| That doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| One purpose, as Mr. Seymour stated, for that requirement is the annexation, but it's not the only purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10346)|
| 2:52:36| And what we're looking at right now is the underlying context of why we plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10356)|
| 2:52:42| We want to be fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10362)|
| 2:52:45| We want to be good stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| We do not do that by allowing chaotic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10367)|
| 2:52:51| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10371)|
| 2:52:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10373)|
| 2:52:54| You've still got two minutes if you've got anything else you'd like to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10378)|
| 2:52:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10379)|
| 2:53:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10380)|
| 2:53:01| Janice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10381)|
| 2:53:11| I'm Janice Toker, 326 Taylor Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10391)|
| 2:53:17| And I'm here on behalf of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission Executive Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10397)|
| 2:53:24| The Executive Committee wishes to provide comments regarding the Knox County Commission's proposed resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10404)|
| 2:53:32| As the commission charged with developing a comprehensive plan to guide the growth and development of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10412)|
| 2:53:39| and for administering this plan, the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission can provide a unique perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10419)|
| 2:53:45| regarding the growth policy plan and the need for an updated general plan to guide Knox County's growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10425)|
| 2:53:53| The growth policy plan is the foundation upon which the land use planning policies of Knox County are based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10433)|
| 2:54:00| These policies provide direction for Knox County policymakers and predictability for Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10440)|
| 2:54:07| The growth policy plan has served the county well in providing the base for decisions regarding the county's growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10447)|
| 2:54:15| Changing conditions require new policies to guide future decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10455)|
| 2:54:20| An updated general plan is needed to address current conditions, future trends, and to take advantage of current and future opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10460)|
| 2:54:29| Now more than ever, Knox County needs to coordinate growth and development with the provision of services and infrastructure this growth demands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10469)|
| 2:54:38| Without a way to guide growth and anticipate the service demands of this growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10478)|
| 2:54:42| Knox County risks inordinate costs to provide infrastructure and services to meet the needs of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10482)|
| 2:54:51| A general plan for growth enables the county to guide growth so that the returns on its investments in infrastructure can be maximized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10491)|
| 2:54:59| Good land use planning can help the local economy in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10499)|
| 2:55:04| As the county grows, employment opportunities must be provided for current and future residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10504)|
| 2:55:10| The identification and protection of land for employment centers is an important part of planning for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10510)|
| 2:55:18| Rather than eliminate the growth policy plan and leave the county with no policy to direct growth and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10518)|
| 2:55:25| we urge the county commission to commit to provide the resources and support needed to update the general plan for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10525)|
| 2:55:34| By working with Knox County residents and incorporating their recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10534)|
| 2:55:38| the general plan can be updated to address the growth and development issues facing the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10538)|
| 2:55:44| and to take advantage of the many opportunities that this growth and development presents for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10544)|
| 2:55:50| We strongly believe that an updated plan is needed to guide the county's growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10550)|
| 2:55:56| Commitment to preparation of an updated general plan for Knox County should be an integral part of the retirement of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10556)|
| 2:56:04| Even a short time without policies to guide and direct land use decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10564)|
| 2:56:10| leaves Knox County vulnerable to decisions that will result in significant future costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10570)|
| 2:56:16| We appreciate the opportunity to provide our thoughts on this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10576)|
| 2:56:20| and look forward to working with the county commission on the update of the Knox County general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10580)|
| 2:56:25| Thank you for your service to the community and consideration of our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10585)|
| 2:56:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10590)|
| 2:56:35| Is there anyone else here who wants to speak on this specific matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10595)|
| 2:56:39| I've gone through my list of folks who had pre-registered with the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10599)|
| 2:56:45| Seeing none, I'm going to go ahead and open this up for some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10605)|
| 2:56:50| Go ahead, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10610)|
| 2:56:53| First of all, I'd like to thank everybody that came out and made a very honest and open discussion about where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10613)|
| 2:57:02| Really, the history is we've been talking about this for two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10622)|
| 2:57:08| One thing that really frustrates me about the whole process is the MPC has known this has been an obstacle for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10628)|
| 2:57:15| and now they want to decide we start to fix the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10635)|
| 2:57:18| We can't do this because of the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| We can't do this because of the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10640)|
| 2:57:23| Last year we talked about dissolving it through state legislation and we didn't punt the ball far enough down the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10643)|
| 2:57:33| So now you can't have a general plan that goes against the state growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10653)|
| 2:57:42| So we've got a general plan and a state growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR265190128?start=10662)|
