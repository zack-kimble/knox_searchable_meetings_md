| 0:03:31| I just want to ask, is there any problem with plan ET?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| I'm not just to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| I just think there's some details that need to be, I'd like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| Details?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| So there's a motion to postpone 11K for two weeks to our next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Mr. Schmidt, are you here to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| John Schmidt, 1318 Granger Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| I'm President of the Board for Nourish Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| We're ready to go ahead with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| I think Councilman had some questions regarding the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| We're a not-for-profit organization, and we're ready to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| We'll wait two weeks and see if we can answer his concerns and get this thing on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| We are kind of under a little bit of a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| That's what I was concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| But if we've got questions and can wait two weeks, then we certainly want to get them all answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Do I have a second to postpone it for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| We have a motion and a second to postpone 11K for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| Councilman Greve, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| I know your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| I bet you know what I'm going to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| I bet you I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| I'd like to postpone 12C for 120 days and also announce that we have one of our final, we hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| signed task force tomorrow evening at 4 o'clock at KCDC, which is open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| But I would like to postpone that for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| We're getting closer to the end, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| You are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Has Councilman Wallace affirmed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Are you going to affirm that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| I'll affirm it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Affirm it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| That is 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| We have a signed ordinance, so there's a motion to postpone for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| This will be the fourth time we've postponed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Is this, do you think, really going to be the last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| I cannot tell you that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| We hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| I had hoped that we didn't have to postpone the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| But we are getting closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| The committee is working hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| and we've had some times that we've had to postpone some of our meetings due to vacations and summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| So, but it's our intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| It's been our intent all along to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| I do think that we're going to have to have a workshop with City Council to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| and to go into detail with what we've done with the whole signed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| It's not just the height of signs, but it's to look at the entire ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| And it's, I'll be the first to admit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| I thought it was going to be a very simple, quick, who laughed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| I remember when he said six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| You're going to bring this up, aren't you, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| She's really rubbing it in, isn't she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| If any of you would like to take my place as chair of that group, I'll be more than happy to turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| We need new boxing gloves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| But, no, it's been, I do want to say that I have to commend the committee that has been put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| It's been a hardworking group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| They've attended every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| And I think George can vouch for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| I'll tell you who else can vouch for all the work that's been done, and that's Ms. Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| who's been also a valuable part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| Let's see if she's okay with this being postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| I was going to say, why don't we check with Cindy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| So, anyway, that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| Well, we appreciate the work that all of you have put into this and all the committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| So there is a motion to postpone 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=438)|

| 0:07:37| We're going to postpone it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=457)|

| 0:08:59| but Visit Knoxville launched a marketing campaign in an effort to attract more visitors to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| The campaign features new ads and videos that are showcasing Knoxville as a destination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| a getaway place, and really for the first time in 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| the campaign focuses on leisure travel in addition to convention and group travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| So in addition to showing a taste of what the campaign will be with videos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=562)|
| 0:09:31| they also, this afternoon, Visit Knoxville held breakout sessions so local groups could sit down with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| learn more about the campaign, how they might involve themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| and take advantage of that to promote their own efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| So look out for that marketing campaign as it gets started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=589)|

| 0:09:59| The meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=599)|

| 0:10:13| Food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Those kind of food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| I'm surprised you're not right on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| Vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=617)|

| 0:10:23| We have fried green tomatoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| These are food trucks, the trucks that sell food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| And so some local food truck vendors have been talking to us about being able to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=629)|
| 0:10:38| and we need to figure out what the correct regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| and permitting of that would be on public and private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| And so we're going to have our first public meeting about this on Wednesday, July 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| so that's a week from tomorrow, at 5.30 p.m. at the Chamber of Commerce on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=650)|

| 0:11:15| from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Enskip Pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| The event is expected to draw about 700 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| This is from our 14 recreation centers across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| and they will be celebrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| It says here they're going to celebrate the end of the summer playground program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| I'm not so sure the kids are going to be celebrating the end of the summer playground program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| But we will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=699)|

| 0:11:55| Of course, our city departments and staff do things all the time to get recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| And I want to focus first on community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| And Becky Wade is here representing her department as the director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=722)|

| 0:12:13| and three awards for various programs, which I'm going to describe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=733)|

| 0:12:32| With these funds, community development, in partnership with our local CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| they will address lead hazards in 250 housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| providing safer homes for low- and very low-income families with children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| and will also perform Healthy Homes assessments in 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| So congratulations on winning that and bringing those dollars back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=768)|

| 0:13:27| I don't know if some of us were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| The department, through Stephanie Brewer-Cook, who is our ADA coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| worked with CSI and other sponsors to educate the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| about the need for accessible design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| So congratulations, Becky, to you, to Stephanie, to all the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| Please tell them we appreciate the great work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=823)|

| 0:13:53| And last but not least, Chief Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| He recently received the legislative award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| from the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| The award was given in recognition of outstanding legislative services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| In his nomination, his colleagues referred to the chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| as a superstar in the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| And the chief was cited for his work on the Pill Mill Bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| which helped law enforcement more effectively deal with drug abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| created by pain clinic operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| So we are also very proud of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| And now that was the end of my formal report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| but Councilman Grieve had sent me an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| to see if I could update you all on a couple of other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| One is Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| On Friday, we received the deed to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| And so actually in two weeks, we'll bring a resolution to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| authorizing me to sign a five-month lease with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| to allow the state to continue to lease certain buildings on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| for the next five months as they make their transition off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| So we'll be sending you information about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| and that will be on the agenda in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| Meanwhile, the public process continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| We're gathering ideas on how that park should be developed and used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| And right now, there are interviews being conducted at the park by the users,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| interviewing the people who are users of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| So we encourage everyone to participate in that, go to the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| make sure we get your ideas for the use of Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| And this fall, sometime this fall, we'll be having the next public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| in which we will try to condense and summarize some of the input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| that we've received so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| But the good news is that we've received the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| It's all been signed, and it's our property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| And I think it's important to emphasize that this is a city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| I know a number of people have called me to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| and I think we should really encourage people all across the city to take the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| and realize that this is a park for everybody in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Yeah, that's really a great comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Wherever you live in the city, you don't have to live near Lakeshore Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| in order to have a stake in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Wherever you live, that park should be really considered a citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| or even a regional park in that sense because of the amenities that it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| and can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| So, yeah, good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| The other update that Councilman Grieve asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| is for the World's Fair Park Working Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| which was to analyze whether the feasibility of adding more cultural assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=995)|
| 0:16:42| to the World's Fair Park, and there have been two public meetings held so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| So we're still in that process of exploring feasibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| looking at some of the focus that's been on the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| for Clarence Brown Theater to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| Also, with Performance Salon, there's some talk about having a permanent stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| that would allow performances, you know, bands and different types of activities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| Contrary to conspiracy theories out there, there are no foregone conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Nothing has been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| All of the dialogue has been public on this and in those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| and I can't stress that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| And so we will continue to do that to explore ideas and feasibility of that park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| and it may be that nothing different happens there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| but whatever is proposed or that comes out of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| will continue to be publicly vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| and of course Council has the final decision on anything that might go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| So it is an open and public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| and we encourage people to come to those meetings and to stay tuned on all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| And finally, you'd asked about McClung Warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| but we'll just talk about that when we get it to the right agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| So that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| I just wanted to announce we'll be having a workshop here August 1st at 530 in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| so everybody is invited to come enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Councilman Dellivotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Yeah, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| One, since we're talking about August 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| I think, Mayor, you're going to be opening the Loves Creek Trail over by Spring Place Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| that morning at maybe 10 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| and we're all excited to see that happen and it's a great trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| and a tribute to our public service team and our parks team in doing that in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| I think it's going to be a great addition to the trail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| Thanks for your support and leadership on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| And the second thing is, and this is less of a report than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| I've been getting comments and inquiries downtown from people who are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| and I'm not sure how we address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| but they're concerned about the treatment that business customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| or visitors are getting when they go to these parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| and get their wheel locks clamped on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| and they come back from what they thought was a happy visit to the market square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| and they got four wheel locks and a $300 bill to pay to get their car out of hock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| And I realize it's private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| but maybe something in our parking codes or disclosure requirements could help minimize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| because it is giving us a little bit of an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| On a downtown, we're all working hard to make wonderful and a great visitor's place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| And I don't know how we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| but maybe some of your chiefs can take a peek at that and see what ordinances we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| Yes, thank you for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| They have, and I'm going to ask Christy Branscom to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| We received the calls as well and immediately looked into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| We have received those calls as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| We did take the ordinance that we have to go down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| and compare it to the signage that's being posted and how things are being processed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| And those that are booting those lots, they are doing it in accordance with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| However, we have just recently investigated how we can curtail some of this activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| And one of those is what you just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| is that in some cases they can put two or three boots on a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| And so what we've talked about is revising our ordinance to only allow for one boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| They are private lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| We have talked to them about their signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| I think there is obviously the misconception that all parking downtown on the weekends is free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| And it is free in city lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| This is not in these private lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| And that's where there is the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| But we will be bringing probably at the next council meeting an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| to try to regulate that just a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| Or an amendment to amend the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| Maybe some kind of warning that says no free parking at any time or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| Those signs are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| I think part of the confusion, because I drove by there myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| they had some sandwich boards out that said public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| But when you go, which, you know, because we do have free public parking on nights and weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| one could assume that that's what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| As soon as you're on their lot, though, there are numerous signs that say never any free parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| Never, ever, ever, basically is what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| It's got a mixed signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| But you get the mixed signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| And so we asked them to change those signs, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Yeah, we asked them not to put up the sandwich board type sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| We asked them not to put up the signs that say public parking because we did feel like it was misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| This weekend, the comments I've gotten back is that they did not put those signs out this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| That doesn't mean that happened on every single lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| There may have been one out there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| But we are continuing to encourage them not to put those signs out there because we felt like it was misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| It is public parking in a sense, but you're public parking on a privately owned lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| And so that's where you have the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| But we do think we'll have some revisions to that ordinance, an amendment that you guys can take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| so that we can try to regulate what's going on just a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| But on city-owned lots, parking is available on the weekends for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| But just be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Make sure that you are on city lots or in city garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Well, I appreciate that because I guess the sense is people feel like they've been snookered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| and then they leave angry and they tell 10 friends never to go there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| And, of course, we don't want that, so we need to figure out how to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| And that's what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| So make sure that where you park, make sure you look at the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| And if it's a city lot, it's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| If it is a privately owned lot that allows the public to park in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| look for the smaller signs that say you have to pay at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| That's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| But we will bring some changes to you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| Thanks for bringing that up because it has been a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| Any other council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1373)|

| 0:23:35| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1416)|
| 0:23:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| 9A is an ordinance to close an unnamed alley from the eastern boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| of parcel 107NJ3 to the western boundary of parcels 107NJ6 and 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Pike Enterprises Applicants, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Councilman Dellivopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Yeah, I just wanted Mark to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| This is an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1443)|
| 0:24:05| It's not a public right of way, but an alley that serves private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| It's not a through street or anything like that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| We think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| I'm Mark Donaldson with NBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| Yeah, the alley, in air quotes, shows up on the ward map as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| but there is really no record that anyone can find of it being dedicated as a public right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| And it's not maintained as a public right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| So basically the adjoining property owners get their land to use as they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| 9B is an ordinance to rezone property located on the south side of Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1491)|

| 0:24:57| Knox Farmers Co-op by Philip B. Campbell Applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| 10B is a resolution approving an appeal by Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision to approve a use-on-review for two duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| subject to conditions in an RP1 planned residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| one on each parcel at 3915 Valley View Drive, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| If you'll recall in the last meeting or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| this came up and the parties agreed that they would sit down and discuss the question of these duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| And one of the big questions was the orientation to the street of the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| as part of their discussions they have come up with a revised layout that has the duplex facing the street reoriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1541)|
| 0:25:50| so the doors in the front look at the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| There is a revised drawing here by I guess it's PLS land surveyors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| And I've given a copy to Ms. Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| but I'm going to ask that this be made a part of the record as the, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| the revision to what MPC had decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| I understand with that sort of correction or revision that the appeal itself is going to be treated as either moot or withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1569)|
| 0:26:18| whatever Mr. Swanson or Mr. Frost tell us need to be due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| But the reason for the objection has been resolved on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| And so as long as we have that documented with the drawing, we're, I think, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| I see Arthur Seymour here if he needs to add anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| But that's the thrust of the party's discussions and how they've worked this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| Probably the most expeditious way to handle that is simply nobody say anything and it will die for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| As long as this is made part of an exhibit to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| You have done that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| I believe Mr. And I spoke to Mr. Donaldson yesterday, and I believe he was wanting, well, I won't speak for him now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| Go ahead, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| On uses permitted on review, the council hears appeals and has the authority to approve, modify, attach conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1623)|
| 0:27:15| or overturn the decision of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| So you don't have to take action on the appeal itself as long as you do something with the application, the original application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1639)|
| 0:27:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| I guess I move to modify the application as approved by MPC to include the revised drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| That's the first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| That would be a legitimate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Then you won't just let it die for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Then you'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Then I'll withdraw, have them move to withdraw the appeal as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| Subject to the modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Subject to the modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| The first one is just the modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| The first one is state that again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| We're modifying the application as approved by MPC on the use on review to include the revised drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1675)|
| 0:28:02| showing the orientation of the duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| I guess just make this Exhibit 1 to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| Yes, and Ms. Mitchell has that, so we're going to number it Exhibit 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| That motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| And then the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| The motion is that, and I guess there are folks from Alice Bell Spring Hill here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| but I'll make the motion, and if they want to address it, I'll welcome them to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| But the motion is to withdraw the appeal in essence as moot in light of the amendment or the modification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| Is that sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| Item 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| to provide $40,404 in emergency solutions grant funding for the Homeward Bound program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Mr. Councilman Delevaux, is your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| I did not remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1754)|

| 0:29:22| Center Inc. to provide $35,000 in emergency solutions grant funding for the Operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| of a Day Resource Center for Homeless Persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Councilman Delevaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Yeah, if I could, Mayor, I'd just like to have Becky explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| This grant is, in essence, part of the whole package we applied for or you applied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| through HUD and others, and we're just now sort of dispersing or assigning the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| to the people who will execute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Is my understanding correct, or if not, please clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| I don't think they heard you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Your mic may not be turned on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| This contract was approved when the annual action plan was approved by City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| submitted to HUD, and our plan has since been approved by HUD as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| So now you're implementing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1822)|

| 0:31:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| And, Council, this and the following five, I think, are all related to the Homemakers Program, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| where we have blighted property, and we get this back into the hands of neighbors or developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| who are going to put houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1904)|

| 0:31:53| With that lead in, and since we're going to kill almost five birds with one stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| the one question I had was it looks like we approved the application for purchase in some of these four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| and three, four, five months earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| How come it takes so long to get all the paperwork to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| I mean, it may be that there's a lot of stuff to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| I'm just curious about the gap in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| It's federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| There's lots of paperwork, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Government, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| It's government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| It's government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Sometimes it takes a few months for us to finalize the Homemakers Agreement with the purchaser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| We try to get them to council as quickly as possible so that we can get them sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| We try to do that within at least two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| So it sometimes just takes longer with the paperwork and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1966)|

| 0:32:50| or whether it's just the process has its duration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| It's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| It's just the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=1979)|

| 0:36:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Yeah, I understand Mark couldn't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| He has an illness or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| But I just want the KUB person, if they're here, to step up and explain what we already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| know, I think, that is that these are coming out of the gas system and the water system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| revenues and not the assets or dollars of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| This is a way of raising money so you can put in the new pipes and things you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| run your system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Sherry Ottinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| And that is exactly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| These are revenue bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| And so they will be paid back only from the gas division revenues and the water division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| There are no tax implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| And if Grandma or someone wants to buy one of these revenue bonds, do they just go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| a private broker or call you at your home at midnight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| I mean, how do they get one of these bonds if they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Your first instinct was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| They just need to call their broker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Okay, we need to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Do we have a motion and a second already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Okay, so this will be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2247)|

| 0:37:32| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2260)|
| 0:37:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| And that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| The next item is a resolution adopted by the City Council of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| on April 20, 1954, entitled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| A Resolution Providing for the Issuance of Water Revenue Bonds so as to Provide for the Issuance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| Not to Exceed $25 Million of Water System Revenue Bonds, Series Z, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| This also requires a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| And that also passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| 11-0 is a resolution approving and authorizing the Mayor to execute a settlement agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| and release in order to conclude litigation associated with real property located on West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Councilman Grieve, did you have specific questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| If you just give us a general review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| So after you all approve this tonight, then also the KCDC Board has to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| By the way, this is the purchase of the McClung or the property on Jackson Avenue associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2327)|
| 0:38:54| with the McClung warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| And so Council approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Then the KCDC Board, it's on their agenda this Thursday to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| And then we also have to get the bankruptcy judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| So we've negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| We've been in settlement talks with the bankruptcy trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| This now has to go to the bankruptcy judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| And then after the judge approves it, then the deeds will be transferred to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| We have plans to then stabilize the buildings and, meanwhile, put out an RFP to the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2361)|
| 0:39:30| community and entertain proposals for the redevelopment of those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| So do you have more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| When was the last time a structural analysis was done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| That was some time ago, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Maybe Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Mr. Wetzel can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| I think it was last year that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| And Bob Wetzel, our redevelopment director, can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| And then, also, while he's coming down, I guess we, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| there's a certain amount of money also needed to stabilize the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| He can talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Is that part of the million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| Bob Wetzel, director of redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| We had a structural analysis done last summer, June of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| As we had been in and out of the building several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| we thought it was time to get one done to know what we were getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Obviously, there's been a great deal of water damage done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| because the roofs on both buildings are not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| There's a large hole in one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| and the other one's lost a lot of its roofing support there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| So we've had to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| So the wood members in there are not in great shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| The foundations seem to be in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| The brick walls seem to be in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Anything that's concrete and steel is looking good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| Obviously, the wood's been wet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| So the stabilization, the report recommended three or four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| One was essentially to make it watertight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| and the best concept for that was to put essentially a shrink-wrapped roof on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| Now, we've not dealt with one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| It's something that people have used in hurricane communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| We've had several talks with vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| We feel like it's a real option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| And the pricing at that time was $40,000 to $60,000 to do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| So we're going to continue to explore that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| How much property will they own, then, from the glass company to the bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| From the east of the glass company down to the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| well, the city except for what is owned by Ernie Gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| There's one piece of property in between Mr. Gross owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| We're in conversations with him, and he wants to work with us to help get it redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| And, of course, he'd like to move on out of the project, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| He's been there a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Are any of the plans, as far as what you're asking for, a request for proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| is it to do the entire piece of property, or are you looking to divide the property up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| That has yet to be finally determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| As we move forward, we'll make some more final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| But the general sense at this time would be something like we did at World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| where we'd say, here's what we have, and make a proposal on all of it or some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| Let us know what you think, and then we'll evaluate those proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| Well, I think that, you know, as far as the project goes for the city, it's really crucial, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| for when you're driving down the interstate and you look over and see these buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| that it seems like that we're at least going the right way in terms of trying to get it developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| because I think it's an important window to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| So, Mayor, I applaud you and your staff for getting this on the road to recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| And as I mentioned before, thanks to Charles Swanson and Bill Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| for spending a day at the negotiation table with the bankruptcy trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| And Mayor Jordana Nelson of the KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| And Jordana Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| And she was there and been part of this project for half a decade now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Is Jordana here as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Thank you, Jordana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Also, we'd like to thank, if I may, we'd like to thank Shane Clinton with the Bassberry Law Firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| who was our attorney, KCDC and the city of Knoxville's attorney in this litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2576)|
| 0:43:02| He did a fabulous job in this mediated negotiation and everything that led up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| And so we'd like to thank him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| We have Mr. Wetzel up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| So you didn't answer one of Duane's questions, which was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| is the $100,000 or thereabouts for stabilization in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| or is that in the appropriation amendment, not in the $1.45 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| What's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| It's not part of the $1.45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| The total, which you'll see, the appropriation is for, like, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| It's $1,360,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| There's already $190,000 in a Jackson Avenue fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| So this $1.3 will go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| So you'll end up with $1,550,000, which will allow us to buy the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| and have $100,000 for stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| That's not in this resolution, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| It's in the budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| This is to settle the dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| The other thing I wanted to bring out, and I thought you did a fine job of describing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| but people may not recognize that we are acquiring a number, what, seven parcels of real property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2644)|
| 0:44:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| As well as resolving a lawsuit that's been going on for three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| And this probably would never have happened if we had to sit down with Mr. Saroff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| and come with an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| And it's, I guess, a tribute to the fact that, unfortunately, it's in bankruptcy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| but someone had to sit there and make the hard economic decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| Hopefully, now, if the city acquires it, we can put it back into productive use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| and, like everyone has said, improve the appearance of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| make good residential or commercial use out of that space, and get that part of Jackson Avenue hopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| So we're excited by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Bob, one thing that was important to me was to talk just a little bit about the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| about when you think you'll be able to get an RFP out and just generally what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| And then also your strategy to we're putting out whatever $1.5 plus million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| I mean, your strategy is to get part of that back, all that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| So kind of speak to that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Once we go through the process of closing, which the mayor has laid out in front of you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| we have to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| But we hope to be ready at the end of that process to basically be ready to move forward some sort of stabilization efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| We hope to be working on that process while we're in the process of moving towards closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| Sometime before the end of the year, we would think we could get an RFP on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| I want to caution everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| One reason we need to get it stabilized is so we don't rush the redevelopment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| We have an opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| We need to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| We need to move on as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| But at the same time, we don't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| This is not a two-week flipper, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| If we don't get these buildings and turn around and get somebody else to take them in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| we're going to have to have a process to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| So that's our general timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| So we would hope to get that done by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| Sometime next year, we would select a developer, we would hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| and then move forward with the redevelopment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| So that's the general timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| We'd love to get as much money back as we have into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| However, we think the most important thing is to make sure we get it back into good use, productive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| It's been a drag on the city for a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| and we need to make sure it's a positive income generator for the next long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Respecting you just mentioned about time, I'm going to ask Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| You said this has to go before the bankruptcy judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| Now, what kind of timeframe are you looking at in terms of possible ruling on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| Can you even come up with something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| It's a little difficult to predict because it depends on the court's docket and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| But I would imagine, assuming the KCDC board approves and you all approve tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| then a motion would be filed with the bankruptcy judge probably within the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2820)|
| 0:47:07| and then it would probably get on the court's docket probably within somewhere between 30, 45 days after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| So I would say maybe within the next 60 days we might have some type of decision from the bankruptcy court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2833)|
| 0:47:21| This is a settlement that makes a lot of sense across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| and so I'm pretty comfortable that this is something that we can anticipate a good result from the bankruptcy court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2848)|
| 0:47:35| You never always know when you go to court what's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| but I'm confident that this is going to turn out all right in terms of the bankruptcy court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| I'm glad to see the process starting, and it's a definite eyesore that will look much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| It's with great, great regret that I'm going to have to recuse myself on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| I guess that was two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| I learned that my firm was involved in some of the litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| I just don't feel comfortable voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| I will say I'm very much in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| And just looking back at 2013, I just think what two great accomplishments we've had on the Baptist side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2894)|
| 0:48:22| and now this that have just been challenges for the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| And I don't think you can overstate the importance of these two accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| I mean, my hat's off to the development community, our development team, the administration, everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2912)|
| 0:48:39| I think for everyone in the center city, I mean, we can't count our chickens on either one of these two projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2919)|
| 0:48:46| but they're just both tremendous accomplishments for the center city, and I'm just excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2926)|
| 0:48:57| Really, two bookends, right, north end and the south end, so it's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| So keep trying to move them both forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| The motion passes with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| 11P is a resolution approving a lease agreement between the city and Knoxville Rowing Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| to lease property under the South Knoxville Bridge for a period of one year for storage of boats and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2967)|

| 0:49:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 2013-2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2980)|

| 0:49:44| Jim York still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| Did he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Jim is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Yeah, Jim, just touching base, I think I know the answer based on our hallway conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| but part of these dollars will come from the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| The surplus appropriated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| I know we have fancy names for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Counting standards, but we are taking some dollars out of our reserve, however we denominate the actual fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| In the funds for the acquisition of the McClellan Warehouse as well as the stabilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3017)|
| 0:50:25| the budget for that will be appropriated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| Last year, at the end of last year, our unassigned fund balance was roughly $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| It stands somewhere at about $17 after some adjustments, and this would bring it down to roughly $16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| Now, again, that's based on last year's numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| When we finalize year end, all those numbers are going to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| but we do have an unassigned fund balance that's available to cover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| When you say year end, you're talking about June 30, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Just closing those books out now as we speak, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| And if, if I could ask one other question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| if Mr. Wetzel and company are successful in getting proposals that bring in dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| will that go back and replenish the pot, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| There are going to be a couple of things that will impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| We will be, assuming that this all comes to fruition, we will be receiving back taxes on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3078)|
| 0:51:29| And in any future development, depending on what happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| we will be receiving property taxes from that stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| So to the extent the investment pans out, we are replenishing the depleted fund somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Any abstentions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| We have four and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| That motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| 8B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 15, Article 2, Sections 15, 51,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| and 57 relating to the nondiscrimination policy for hiring City of Knoxville employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| That brings us down to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| We have several people who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| And thank you for sitting through all of the meeting to get us to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| This is the order I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| If you just want to be ready, Vivian Shipe, Judy Barnett, Rocky Swingle, Tom McDaniel, and Xavier Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3151)|
| 0:52:42| And by council rules, I'm going to set my timer, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| And we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Hi, Ms. Shipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Hey, it's nice to see you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| And I told you I would still be here and I'd be coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| Believe me when I tell you I'm going to keep coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| Well, we look forward to seeing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| We need the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| We've listened to some wonderful things the city's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| We're getting Jackson Street bought and we're going to make it pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| Lakeshore is now going to be a city that's going to be regional and open for the whole city, not just for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| I will be looking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| We need the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| Now I'm here, we've got $19 million in unused funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| But what I don't hear is any excitement about let's go to the table and let's help the homeless and the mentally ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| I'm hearing that kind of excitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| And those people are not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| They're part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| So somewhere on the drawing board there needs to have been and still needs to be a plan for how we're going to help our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| They are our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| They're sitting over in the county jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| They are our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| We do have a responsibility to them, not just the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| I know we had a task force meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| I know the next task force meeting is September 5th at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| So when that task force comes back together, let's have an understanding of who these people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| Don't go to that table with the mentality that these are just drunks and alcoholics and drug addicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| These are your children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| These are your husbands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| These are your wives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| These are citizens of this community, many of whom are struggling every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| And I'm just here to let you know that I'm still watching and I'm still going to be coming back in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| I want to know what that task force decided today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| I want to know what is your opinion, every single one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| You set that task force up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| You've got some good people on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| You've got Dr. Noe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| You've got your police chiefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| You've got your mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| I know Dr. Noe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| And I'm telling you, if you listen to him and listen to these people, okay, come back to us and say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| those people are just as important as these people in West Knoxville, at this Jackson Street project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| those people that are sleeping on the street, that are naked, that are walking around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| not of any problem of their own because they don't have help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| Let's get the safety center built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| And the rest of us that are here, we're going to go change some laws on the state and the national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| Don't think we're going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| But I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| But I told you the last time I was here, I was coming back and I will be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Thank you, Ms. Schein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| And next is Judy Barnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| And she was at the meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| I saw her at the safety center meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| My name is Judy Barnett from 1312 Parkland Road, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| I'm speaking out on behalf of unfortunate friends and family members who have experienced episodes of addiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| or mental illness resulting in incarceration and criminal charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| all because there is no community safety center to provide triage to separate mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| and addiction issues from criminal justice and public safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| It should not be a crime to have a disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| whether addiction or mental illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| My son has asked me never to speak of his psychotic episodes again, so I will call him Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3351)|
| 0:55:58| Craig was an honor graduate from West High School, all-state cross-country runner, Eagle Scout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| and recruited to Columbia University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| There he began to show symptoms of mental illness which were not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| We only saw him a few times after he left for New York City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| each time becoming more concerned for his mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| By the time he had to withdraw from school, he was no longer covered by our insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| Our attempts to get treatment for him met with resistance and frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| Resistance on his part, frustration on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| He has been in and out of Maloneyville, Lakeshore, Cobb County Detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| where he actually received the very best treatment ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| and other jails on his way to California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| He has a criminal record because we have criminalized psychotic and nonviolent behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| such as appearing intoxicated in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| As a result of his untreated illness and poor decision-making,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| he was involved in defending himself from a knife attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| His weapon was a skateboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| The ultimate result has been six years in prison and two felonies on his record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| He is currently on parole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| living a subsistence life of making bead necklaces to sell on the street in Oakland, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| A safety center might have diverted him into treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| instead of labeling him a criminal and a felon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| The proposed safety center in Knox County will only be able to handle a small fraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| of the potential inmates who need help instead of jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| They will not be the violent criminals, and they will not be released to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| There is a cost to care for those unable to care for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| We're currently paying the cost of mental illness through the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| Our resources should instead go to the public health and treatment system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| I hope this city will support a future safety center and allocate money to its operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| We now have Rocky Swingle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| And, sir, by council rules, I'll set the timing here for up to five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Yes, my name is Rocky Swingle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| I live on Sheffield Drive in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| I want to make a few comments about an issue that you're going to be discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| and voting on soon probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| which is the rezoning of the Middlebrook Pike property where Tenova wants to build a new hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| while at the same time essentially shutting down the old St. Mary's as a full-service hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| I'm not speaking just for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| There are some residents here, if they want to stand and identify themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| who are here in support of what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| Also, we have a petition which has approximately 250 signatures opposing the new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3541)|
| 0:59:09| Some of you were at the West Hills Community Association meeting recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| where about 100 people showed up at a meeting that usually gets about 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| and everybody who spoke spoke against the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| There's a lot of opposition in West Hills and surrounding areas to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| First, there's several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| The first is it's a bad plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| It's a bad health plan for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| That's because it really isn't a health plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| It's a plan to make money for Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| Nothing wrong with making money, but this is a life-and-death issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| This isn't moving a widget factory from one side of town to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| They're essentially going to shut down St. Mary's as a full-service hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| The busiest emergency room in the city, this is what they say, will be no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3593)|
| 1:00:00| It will be replaced by urgent care, which is a walk-in clinic that won't be open 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| There won't be acute care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| There won't be surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| There will be behavioral, senior, subacute administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| It has 400-some odd beds now, St. Mary's does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| 250 to 300 of those will move west, according to their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| I did a quick check on the 2010 census for the population that's served by that hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3624)|
| 1:00:34| The zip code that St. Mary's is in, 37919, plus the zip codes immediately to the east, the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| and the southeast have about 64,000 people in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| Those are just the four zip codes immediately adjacent to where this hospital is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| Those are the people who will be losing these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| That's not to mention the adjacent zip codes in the counties that are outlying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| On the other end, in West Knoxville, the zip code where they want to put the hospital is 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3659)|
| 1:01:07| The three adjacent zip codes to the west of that, including 09, have a population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| the 2010 census, of about 104,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| So, yeah, there are a lot more people in West Knoxville, but there are also two hospitals in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| So you're moving the hospital away from 64,000 people to an area that already has two hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| That's not a good health plan for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| That's one reason that we're opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| Secondly, what you hear mostly from residents is traffic on Middlebrook Pike and the surrounding streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| particularly cut-through traffic in West Hills, and also just on Kingston Pike and the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3702)|
| 1:01:50| All of that is going to feel a surge of traffic, Weisgarber and Old Weisgarber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| This is a 300-bed hospital, 250- to 300-bed hospital, open 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| It's Park West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| Park West has 309 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| So picture a seven-story Park West on Middlebrook Pike with four entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| That's what they plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| The other issue, another big issue, is just the intrusion into a quiet residential neighborhood of West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| Like I said, a seven-story building, open 24-7, lights, ambulances, helicopters, visitors, staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3740)|
| 1:02:29| All of that is completely inappropriate for this part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| Another quick check on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| You have 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| There are about 300 residences within a half-mile of this proposed hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3762)|
| 1:02:50| In closing, I have a couple other points, but in closing, I'd like to ask the Council to do three things, four things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| before you do anything else about voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| One is to do a traffic and environmental study, both independent, unbiased, not a Tenova study, your study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| or hire somebody on the environmental side, pay particular attention to the drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| and the stream that crosses this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| Also, include this issue in your August 1st workshop so you can hear more about these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| I don't know if that's possible, but I would request that you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| And finally, come look at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| I can take you through a backyard, and we can walk directly onto the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| and you can see what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| Mr. McDaniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| Tom McDaniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| Mayor, Council people, I'm Tom McDaniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| I live at 6800 Stockton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| Prior to purchasing that house, I was very concerned because it sat on 109 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3829)|
| 1:03:57| I felt comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| I checked with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| I checked with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| It was agricultural, and it was protected by a scenic highway on three sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| Now I'm surrounded by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| I used to go to the Gatlinburg City Council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| There was a builder there named Tony Rast, and at least three times in the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| he would come up and was being taken to task for building in the setback, and he would apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| And his statement was that it was too harsh of a penalty to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| Once it was done, it was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| And you have it in your hands to prevent this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| At the beginning of the meeting tonight, Commissioner Wallace called upon God to help you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| He said, but you have this responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| You as people on this earth can take responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| You have the power to protect many of the things that was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3892)|
| 1:04:59| You have the power to protect many of the people that have been brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| And in your meetings, you've expressed concern with the people of North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| And I can't imagine anything that would hurt them more than closing that hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| I would like to just slightly touch on the credibility of the Tenova people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| because they are so good at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| I was told repeatedly by Tenova that the reason they chose that site was that they needed 110 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3925)|
| 1:05:31| and they tossed the responsibility to me to find another site that was 110 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| Then I went to the meeting where they made a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| and bragged on the fact that they were using one-third of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| that they didn't need the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| Then their attorney came in this very room and said, well, right now we don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| For the purposes of rezoning, they don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| But once they've got that, it will be very easy to make the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| We want to rezone it to commercial, whatever they want to rezone it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| because they are now adjacent to something that's not agricultural and protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| They stated they were going to build a low-impact building of seven stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| and yet their architect makes a presentation how easily they can expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| and that the expansion is going to be upward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| They said they're going to have an emergency room that they're not really going to use that much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| yet presently they have the most utilized one in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| And their architect, again, was making a statement how easily they could expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| that particular part of the hospital, which is right outside of my living room window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| which is right where the helicopter is going to be landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| which is right next to the power station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Should that helicopter fall and miss homes, it could go into a power station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| We've got a neighborhood that doesn't have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| I guess it has one sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| We've got schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| We've got elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| We've got middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| We've got churches that on any Sunday, if any of you all have been down Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| all four lanes of traffic are stopped as the congregations are being let out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| church after church after church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| If you take a traffic survey during the middle of the week, you're not going to catch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| If you take a traffic survey, it is not randomly going to catch whenever those schools have a function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| If it's not there when they're dropping the kids off or they're picking their kids up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| you're not going to get the full impact of the impact on that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| Again, I would invite any of you all, walk down my driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4058)|

| 1:07:51| I really hope that you will not allow this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4071)|

| 1:08:08| Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| Like everything that got said, 37909, we're going to have a conflict with that middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| The middle school, 745 to 915 every morning, you can't turn left on Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| because the kids are trying to get to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| That's going to cause a problem, and you all are going to go ahead and vote for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| and you all are going to put a camera light up there and start sighting us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| and getting us every chance you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| That school is more important than the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| The hospital is here to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| I took my son there for a sprained ankle to Tenoba out in Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| They charge $11 for one Tylenol pill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| Why can't the doctor be nice enough and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| go home and go to Walmart and buy you some Tylenol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| We don't have to charge you for a pill here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| And what these ladies are saying, I'm going to show up with them every time for that safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| That's more important than you guys sitting up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| The homeless are out there because we don't care for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| The homeless are out there because we don't want to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| The homeless are out there because we decided they're not important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| I have 20 years in recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| I know what it is to be homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| I know what it is to be in recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| I go and feed them guys and them ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| I go take them clothes that I go get from other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| At West Hills Elementary, we have a clothing drive that I get all the leftover clothes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| and take it under that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| That's the biggest sore eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| You can call your buildings a sore eye all you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| Them buildings are going to make you some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| These homeless people and these drug addicts, we are here for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| In the invocation, he prayed for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Now do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| As far as Tenova, that's the biggest joke in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| St. Mary's is a landmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| If them ladies of St. Mary's, if you get them a shovel, when you all get your shovel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| then I believe that you all are supporting what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| But if them ladies don't have a shovel with that gold thing on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| and that smile on their face when you all start digging, we're going to have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| And that Dwayne Greaves guy, he sat in that church at our last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| and laughed right in our face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| And his architects are the same guys that are building the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| You don't even have a bid on it as to who's going to build the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| He already knows it's going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| I called Ms. Palmer and talked to her personally at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| And what did she tell me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| What is your concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| Why are you worried about Tenova?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| We're worried about it because our property taxes have went down $9,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| because we know the hospital is going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| We just had an increase on our property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Now it's going to drop $9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| And we middle class are going to suffer from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| Like I said, we have one little sidewalk, and the sidewalk goes from Francis Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| to Building Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| After that, we don't have a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| And look at the trees in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| Them trees are more greener than over in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| We take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| I see people, and we take care of that property that they're going to build on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| by picking up beer cans, picking up glass bottles, picking up the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| I was stopped in the road and picked up some trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| And when I first saw the FBI building being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| and then I saw the Dow Springs area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| it was just a matter of time before your vote come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| and you all get your nice gold shovels out and get the ceremony going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| Just give us a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| And stop lying to us and let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| We'll go ahead and tell the truth and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| Mary, we're going to close you down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| You're not a landmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| We're here to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| And that's all I'm asking for is give us some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| But as far as Safety City, I'm going to be here the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| I'm going to be here before she gets here just to speak up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| Okay, council, there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130723?start=4339)|
