| 0:04:04| Real quickly, Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| I think everybody knows that we're going to be reopening I-40 on June 12th, completing the smart fix project on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=245)|
| 0:04:14| let's see, make sure I got my days right, on the night of the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| There's a mile run and a fun walk that starts at 7 on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| Your only chance ever to run down the middle of I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Or to walk down the middle of I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| So if you would like to do that, obviously you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| And then the official opening is the afternoon of the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| And then Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| What time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| That's at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| The official opening I think is at 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| On the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Are they opening it after the run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| No, they're not opening it to the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| The run is the night of the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| The opening I think is at 2 o'clock on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| And where does the run begin or end either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| On I-40, but I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Somewhere between here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| On the new section of I-40, I'm sorry, I don't know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| I'm sure the logistics will be published in the paper, but I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| And, by the way, if you win that race, you'll be the winner for all time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| since there will never be another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| This Friday is First Friday, and that, as you know, means lots of activities downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| I encourage everybody to visit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| And Saturday, the Farmer's Market on Market Square as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Mr. Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Mayor, this is one of those I almost reluctantly do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| but this is going to draw attention to ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| and that is that this Friday at 7 o'clock at Tyson Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| the city has a softball team, and we're going to be competing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| And I just wanted to let everyone know if they want to come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| there's a competition for the second Harvest Food Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| so bring canned goods and come out for the entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| I wanted to announce a city council workshop on June 11th at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| I believe this is the presentation of the Nassau Area Transit Long Range Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| I think I've got that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| That's on my calendar, June 11th here, 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| You know, I have really struggled with myself about mentioning this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| but had the or took the opportunity to attend the GED graduation a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| almost two weeks ago, a week and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| And I just want to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| I believe I have never had an evening that was such a wonderful experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| I went because I'm on the advisory board for the juvenile court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| and we had about 14 or 15 young people that Judge Irwin has mentored very beautifully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| and it's been his desire to see young people who have no chance to graduate take jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| and find a way to get their high school diploma because of his feeling of how important that is to those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=429)|
| 0:07:17| So I really went to support those kids, thinking there would be a few people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| Well, the church, the Central Methodist Church, was absolutely packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| There was not seating room for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| It was an incredible occasion where everyone was just so excited, and the families were all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| There was so much support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| These people, age 64 down to 17, 18, who had gotten their GEDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| were just absolutely ecstatic about their accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| And it was a wonderful, wonderful thing to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| One gentleman, I believe he was the oldest, was 64, and he had been a CEO of a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| You all may have read the story or heard it on the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| He had been a CEO of a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| He had never, ever achieved his own high school diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| And this, for him, was just unfinished business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| But there were testimonials there that were marvelous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| And Deidre Charles, who is an assistant basketball coach at UT, was the speaker for the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| And she told her story about coming to UT, did not have her high school diploma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| and could not play her freshman year because she had to achieve the academic status that would allow her to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| So she played only three years and graduated with NCAA honors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| There was a young woman who, in that short year of achieving her GED this year, 30 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| she's a young mother, she was working, finished her GED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| Actually achieved her ACT within a few weeks of going into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| She then achieved the opportunity to take AP courses, college courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| She now, in less than a year, has been accepted to medical school after completing a nursing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=549)|
| 0:09:18| So it has extraordinary stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| And our city employees were there, along with their superiors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=561)|
| 0:09:30| And it was David Brace and Buddy, help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Harold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Harold just had a brain freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| And they were so excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| When I saw them sitting there, I thought, gee, I wonder why they're sitting on the balcony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| But I just had to comment on that because that means so much to Knoxville and to Knox County and to these families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=584)|
| 0:09:54| So this program is an excellent program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| If anybody ever suggests you go and spend an evening there for the graduation, treat yourself because you will be blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=596)|
| 0:10:05| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| I was their graduation speaker last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| It's a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| I was privileged this afternoon to be able to go out to our own City of Knoxville Fire Training Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| and was there with Fire Marshal Byrd when we introduced to the community Knoxville's new arson dog, Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| She is a yellow Labrador and absolutely engaging and fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| And the fire department, a young woman officer and a young man officer, were able to put out a demonstration fire where an accelerant had been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=627)|

| 0:12:13| We do have several folks sent up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| I was just going to propose to move an item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| Oh, actually, that actually might be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| I think we have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| I would second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Can we pull back the, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=744)|

| 0:12:31| We do have a couple of resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| I think folks want to do now while people are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| So, I will go to you now, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=756)|

| 0:12:52| 11U, please, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=772)|

| 0:12:56| and expressing appreciation to Fred Charles Charlie Hahn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| and wishing him all the best in his future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| We need a motion to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| We just moved to put it up in the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Ms. Bielow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Is this the proper time to make some comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| Mr. Hahn is with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| and I think that it would be nice if he could come forward so everyone can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=799)|
| 0:13:28| While we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Charlie, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Can I butt in and ask about an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Mr. Hahn, come on down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Come on down to the podium maybe over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Would it be a proper amendment to instruct the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| to keep Charles Hahn from leaving the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| That seems much smarter than honoring and wishing him well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| It's a good idea, but it's probably beyond their jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Dang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| Mr. Hahn is just someone who is actually a constituent of Councilman Foss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=835)|
| 0:14:02| but I had a conversation with him on Sunday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| and he expressed the fact that he and his wife Jody are going to need to leave Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| and join some of their family members in Fredericksburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| And, Vice Mayor Becker, I did all the persuasion I could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| but it seemed that decision is pretty firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| I think it's even out of Mr. Hahn's hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| because I believe that his son has just decided that's the best thing for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| So the family is extremely happy to have him join them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| And I said, well, you will bless any community that you move into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| and you'll find a wonderful church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| And he said, oh, heck, I've already found the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| He said, I've been active in that church, been taking trips with them and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| So he's just joining another wonderful community that will appreciate him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| and he has just added so much richness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| In addition to all these wonderful words, are you going to read the wonderful words, Mr. Foss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| I was, and I was going to say other nice things about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| Go ahead, Mr. Foss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| I met Mr. Hahn, I guess, 10, 11 years ago at probably an MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| or a city council meeting over a zoning dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| He probably could give a seminar on how zoning works, the public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| and how to put together and deliver a really good presentation about zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| I mean, you know, though he's a little shorter, he'd certainly stand toe-to-toe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| with the best zoning attorneys in town and argue with them about what's good and what's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| and what's good planning and what's bad planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| And do it in such a sweet way that he convinces everybody that, of course, that's what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| He was always one of the speakers when major zoning issues came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| and he was always polite and respectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| and you just can't say enough good things about him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| and enough good things about his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| They're a great inspiration for that neighborhood, for that organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| a driving force behind constantly prodding me and Mayor Haslam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| and others for the road realignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Yeah, we'll keep him posted on how that's coming along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| so he can come back and participate in a ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| But he's really going to be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| His wife is going to be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| And it will be a great loss for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| And, Councilman, I think that the group that may miss him the very most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| is a group of, is it fourth graders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| I think Mr. Hahn has taught a Sunday school class in his church for fourth graders for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| would it be, Charlie, 50 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| This is the 60th year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| So an extraordinary man who's had a marvelous impact on a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| We're going to miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| We're going to miss you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Charlie, I think all of us join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Rob and Barbara put it very well, so I won't add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| But we appreciate not only all your work but the way you've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| I think both Barbara and Rob referred to the spirit you brought to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| I think it really has made us a better city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=1038)|

| 0:37:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Hi, I'm Beth Oak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| I'm a legal clerk at the Disability Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| It's at 900 Easter Hill Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| I'm here to represent Dr. Otis Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| I hope it's clear that I'm not Dr. Otis Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| I'm here to read a statement he prepared regarding the K-A-T lift cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| Dr. Stevens is a renowned member of the University of Tennessee College of Law faculty, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| the year 2000, he became the college's resident scholar on constitutional law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| He has authored, co-authored, or edited six books on the United States Constitution and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| He recently advocated civil rights of Americans with disabilities when he sued the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| of the Treasury, revealing that the United States fails to provide currency that is distinguishable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| to the blind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| His statement is as follows, the paratransit service, better known as the KAT Lyft, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| been available for many years to qualified persons with disabilities residing within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| the corporate limits of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| The current proposed city budget calls for a limitation of this service to individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| living within three quarters of a mile on either side or from the end of each fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| route in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| A substantial number of current Lyft riders will lose this vital service if the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| budget is fully implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| It has been reported that this rejected reduction would amount to approximately $125,000, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| nearly 0.61% of the KAT budget of $20,431,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2338)|
| 0:39:06| Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act clearly emphasizes the non-discriminatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| access to fixed route service, with complimentary paratransit acting as a safety net for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| who cannot use the fixed route system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| This law and the United States Department of Transportation regulations that are designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| and implemented recognize that paratransit services fall within the category of civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Those who use the Lyft service rarely have access to any other form of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| Their civil rights will be violated if this service were terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| Moreover, the immediate problem would be compounded by the inevitable increase in demand for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| Lyft service as the number of people with disabilities increases in the coming years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| as the population ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| In light of the serious problems that would confront current users of the Lyft, whose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| service would be eliminated by the proposed budget reduction, and the certainty that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| problem will increase in the future, I strongly recommend that citywide Lyft services be retained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| in full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Signed, Dr. Otis Stephens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| And Lillian Virch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Hi, I'm with the Disability Resource Center, 900 East Hill Avenue, and I am going to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2411)|
| 0:40:20| this really short for you guys because I know you worked really hard yesterday and a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| of you heard this, but I read a great quote today, and it was by our future governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| and it said, together we're going to make our great state even greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| Before you go, make sure that Knoxville stays as great as it has been for the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2432)|
| 0:40:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| And Jeanette Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2443)|
| 0:41:05| Hi, I'm Jeanette Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I'm the Employment Coordinator with the Disability Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| It's my honor and privilege to come here to talk to you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| I was here last night and gave you a few scenarios on how cutting the CAT transit would affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| people who are looking for employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| Well, I thought maybe it'd be a little bit better if I could actually introduce you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| people who would be cut if the services were cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| Carrie, right here, she's the young woman I told you about last night who is in her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| 90-day probationary period at work, at her job, and she had to switch from the CAT Lyft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2498)|
| 0:41:48| to CAC Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| This is a perfect example of how it's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| Within the first month of work, they got her to work late twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| She got her first write-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| That's not going to be good when she gets her 90-day evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| Last Monday, last week, she works in a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| The daycare closes at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| All children are to be picked up by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| CAC Transportation didn't even show up until after 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| Now the director of that daycare had to pay an employee to sit there and wait while Carrie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| waited on her transportation, who didn't show up for an hour late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| That's dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| So that's one example on how it's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| Nicole here, she has her bachelor's degree in political science, and she can't go get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| a job until we get a result of this hearing because she's going to be using the CAT Lyft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| if you give us the budget money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| If you don't, she's going to have to leave her family home, move into the city, and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| be able to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| But that's kind of a catch-22 because she can't leave her home to move into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| How is she going to pay rent until she finds a job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| She can't find the job because she can't even go on to an interview because there won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| be any way for her to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| Here's another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| David here, he is not working yet, but we are actively seeking employment for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2601)|
| 0:43:28| He lives in West Knoxville, but he still lives within city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| He definitely rides the CAT Lyft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| If the budgets are cut, we're going to have to be very selective on the areas that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| can even apply for work for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| And if he has to switch over to CAC Transportation to get to and from a place of employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| we'll be running into the exact same things we're running into with Carrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| They're getting her to work on late and not picking her up until way past the operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| So all of us, this is just three, but we understand CAT says only four people are being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| Well, then I have three of them standing right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| So what we're asking is that you please help CAT with the budget, if indeed that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2661)|
| 0:44:29| it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| These people, they want to work, they are dedicated employees, and their only problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| right now is holding them up as their transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| So we're just requesting that you provide the money to keep CAT in full operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Okay, those are the only folks we have signed up to speak to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| Okay, go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| My name is Brian Hilbert, and I live at 860 20th Street in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| I hope you'll pardon my lateness to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| I'm a grad student at UT, and I had to run from class to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| And I wanted to just thank you all for the valiant effort that you're making at times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| like these with tight budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| I wouldn't want to be in your position, and I appreciate the good job that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| I became a Knoxvillian seven years ago when I came to the University of Tennessee to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| my education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| I've earned a bachelor's degree in history and political science and a master's degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| And in those seven years, I have never been late to work, to school, or to other appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| And for somebody who uses public transportation, that is a wonderful statement to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| As I prepared to live my life, I looked across this state and across the country at systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| that would be helpful and appropriate to me, and I found that this beautiful city had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| very best system, bar none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| And I'm very scared as I move forward as a person and as a professional that these cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2762)|
| 0:46:10| are going to affect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| We could build the most wonderful city with the greatest amenities, but if people don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| have the means to access them, then they're no good at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| And I believe that there are many people now and many people in the future who, under current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| CAT services, could live happy, full, and complete lives in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| But if these cuts take place, I fear very much that many of those people will either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| move into nursing home facilities or become prisoners in their own homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| And it's not just persons with disabilities, it's the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| I wouldn't want to be a person who had to tell my mom or dad or grandma or grandpa that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| they would have to move from their home to a nursing home because transportation wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| there to let them live their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| And again, I want to thank you for the valiant effort that you're doing, that you're giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| to this budgetary process, and for the wonderful transportation service that you currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| oversee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Ms. Roddy, I saw your light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| Or Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Yesterday, after folks who were concerned about this issue left and we had discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| afterwards about this, I think at least this member of council wants to see the Lyft service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2843)|
| 0:47:33| worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| We've got two very disparate numbers on how many people are or aren't going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| I know Ms. McGinnis and I exchanged some emails late this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| I might have one waiting for me when I get back to the office from when I left today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| But later here on the agenda tonight, just looking at it, there are three change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| Over $600,000 for South Waterfront, something off of Westland Drive and Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2876)|
| 0:48:06| There's not a project, there's not a dollar that this city has that has umpteen different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| ways we can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| That's a good thing, but that's often a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| I think government leads by example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| I think this government has led by example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| Government can't do everything that the private sector does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| There's some things that are just cut out for government to fulfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| I think this is one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| I think we need to get some firm numbers back as to how many people really are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| I think we're probably going to need to come back and we might need to do some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| supplement to the budget where we can try to bridge some gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| We talk about funding the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2936)|
| 0:49:03| That's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| I think people are concerned about concentration of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| People who are living in their homes are obviously dispersed within their communities and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| a good thing for people to have interaction with a cross-section of society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2953)|
| 0:49:20| That's beneficial to the people who need to lift services for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| I think this is something that might be a tough nut to crack, but I think it's the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Thanks, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I think, first of all, I want to thank everybody who came down tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| I acknowledge the difficulty that it takes for many of those folks to get to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| and I also want to thank them on behalf of the city for their compliments about our transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| I think we're very proud of what we do and what we provide and we try to make that service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| I think what I heard Councilman Frost say is that this issue is important, but doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| necessarily need to hold up approval of this ordinance or approval of the budget tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| I think there are still some missing pieces in terms of information that we're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| from folks that are invested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| I guess I also would like to call on Ms. McGinnis and ask if she has any comments that she would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| While she comes down, I would like to suggest that we go ahead and address the budget tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| and approve it if there are not any other amendments or changes that we see being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| and then continue to work on this issue later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| I'd like to start with a question for you Ms. McGinnis and I'm sure Councilman Woodhall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| as our representative to the CAT Board would know this answer too, but my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| is that the CAT Board is the one that approves or changes routes, not City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| And where is the decision point with the KTA Board in terms of this issue right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3047)|
| 0:50:55| The KTA Board failed to recommend a service area definition for the lift because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3055)|
| 0:51:05| did not want to impact the people who would be cut from service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| So it was felt from an administrative standpoint that the three-quarter mile limit be established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| What happened is back in the early 1990s, the ADA law was passed and some quote from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| Dr. Stevens was absolutely correct, the ADA law also established that paratransit services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| had to be available to people on a non-discriminatory basis as a safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| This is for people who can't get to a bus stop and they said, realizing that not all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| areas in the community have public transit, they thought three-quarters of a mile was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| a reasonable distance to provide the comparable paratransit services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| And when the city first submitted its paratransit plans, it said it would comply with this three-quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3112)|
| 0:52:00| mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| It didn't say it would comply with the three-quarter mile, it said it would be in compliance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| the service area definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| That was in the early 90s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Early 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Over time, there have been annexations to the city and I'm not sure what the corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| boundaries are that have been referenced earlier, but CAT got in the habit of providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3134)|
| 0:52:21| services to certain annexed areas of the city and not to other annexed areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| So we're providing services to Strawberry Plains, but we're not providing services to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Last year, as you know, was a very tough budget year and we looked at a variety of options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| to bring the budget back in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| And these trips to Strawberry Plains were prohibitively expensive, especially at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| time because fuel was so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| So we're taking one person to Strawberry Plains, I mean it could be a $30 trip, and anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| we really felt a need for a consistent definition of lift services and we asked the KTA to reestablish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| that the lift service would be the three-quarter mile boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| They failed to do that and administratively, we felt that we had to go back to the three-quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| mile boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| At the beginning, we knew that about 30 people would be impacted by this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3189)|
| 0:53:16| We worked with CAC, we identified that of those 30 people, approximately 14 people needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| work-related trips and we had JARC funding, that got us in budgetary trouble a few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| ago too, Job Access Reverse Commute funding, anyway I won't get too long with it, but JARC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| funding is available to communities and CAT and CAC decided that CAC would get this funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| to provide the work-related trips and they have absorbed these work-related trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| And of those original 30 people that we were talking about a year ago, we've got approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| 4 to 6 people and the numbers are going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| The numbers will change every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Our ridership numbers change every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| People's travel patterns change every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| The numbers are going to be different every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| But right now, we know there are 4 to 6 people who take trips totally outside the three-quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| mile service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| Their trip starts and their trip ends outside the three-quarter mile service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| And there are another handful of people who take trips that originate within the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| area and end outside the service area or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| So yes, the numbers are going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| We knew, basically though, saving these 30 trips, or 30 people who were taking the trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| outside the three-quarter mile service area, would save us about $10,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| And we instituted the three-quarter mile service area change on weekends, effective November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| 1st, and realized quite a bit of savings just from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| We had more CAT vans out on Sunday than we had buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| I mean, a non-disabled person taking a bus does not have access to the same public transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3295)|
| 0:55:03| services that a lot of Lyft riders did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| And I remind you, the paratransit law was designed to be a safety net for people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| couldn't get to a bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| And that's paratransit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Now, communities go beyond the three-quarter mile, and that's up for the communities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| But these were very expensive trips for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| And CAC will also provide trips if you cover the full cost of the trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| That wasn't mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| They're happy to contract for people if they will, on an hourly basis, cover the full cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| of the trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| So we were simply trying to get some guidance on what is the Lyft service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| Because frankly, we're kind of nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| We're doing the service here, sort of on a call several years ago from the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| saying service person, service area, but not serving an area over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| So the numbers will change, but of the original 30 people, the work trips, CAC now has, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| we have five or six people who will be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| And we did set a date of September 1st to totally go back to the three-quarter mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| We had grandfathered a group of people to have these trips, to continue to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| trips that originally had the trips while we had this discussion period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| But it's felt that they're receiving a benefit that other people aren't receiving, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| need to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| So there sort of needs to be a cutoff date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| Ms. McGinnis, a quote that you made from the policy that was passed at the federal level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| in the early 90s is important to me in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| You said that we need to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| I think we need to be non-discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| And what I'm hearing you say is that right now we are discriminating against potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| riders who live in a part of the city that we're not serving because we are serving other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| members who are further out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| You gave the Straw Plains example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| And we are serving folks who are allowed to take trips to locations that are outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| the city or outside the service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| And for me, the important part of this discussion is coming up with a non-discriminatory policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| that treats all members of our transit system equitably, no matter what their needs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| and no matter where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| But I still think this is something that we can continue to work through outside of passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| of this budget tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| I am the council rep to the KTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| And so I was part of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| I don't recall that we failed to create a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| That's not my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| My recollection at the KTA is that we disagreed with the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3455)|
| 0:57:44| I also remember that we were told that it really wasn't our call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| It was also stated at this council meeting here that the KTA had supported the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| cuts, including the cap adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| And I brought it up that, no, that actually wasn't the way it unfolded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3483)|
| 0:58:12| I was part of the meeting that was conducted after the mayor suggested that we get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| and discuss options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| And we actually had two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| And according to this, and I was not at the second meeting, according to this, the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| meeting, you made the announcement that it was going to go to the three-quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| So really, we really only had one meeting to discuss these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| But I disagree that the KTA failed to create a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| I don't recall that we were asked to brainstorm options around something different than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3524)|
| 0:58:52| currently existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| And what I recall is that we disagreed with the adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| We were willing to talk about some of the express routes, but not this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| I think we're approaching it from different angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| Well, you say it a couple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| It made it seem like we were being negligent in providing you feedback or guidance as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| an option other than the option that you chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| So that didn't sound right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| I agree with Councilman Frost that I think at this juncture, it is the right thing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3566)|
| 0:59:35| do to support, to keep Lyft as it currently is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| It sounds to me like there are a lot of internal adjustments that need to be made in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| of who qualifies for the route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| I mean, all the numbers keep shifting around, or I'm not going to say shifting around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| I hear a lot of different numbers in terms of how many people this service serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3595)|
| 1:00:06| You're saying four now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| We said four several weeks ago, and we were seeing four people making these trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| Now we're seeing five or six people making these trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| It's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| It's a reservation service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| People call in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| They're not going to call in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| It's a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| It's like ridership on our fixed route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| It rains one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Somebody cancels their trip for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| It's just, it is a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| Well, point one, the KTA did not fail to create a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| We just didn't agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Two, I don't think we've had adequate time to discuss this in our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| Three, I mean, it's hard to really understand what numbers are the true numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3642)|
| 1:00:50| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| I have to agree with Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| And pretty much most of the other things that these councilmembers have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| I think this service is something that's very important to these individuals that will be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| And I think most people know here that I'm not trying not to be very frivolous with the taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| but I actually think this is a program that would be very beneficial to these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| and it would be very worthwhile to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| Councilman Pilo, and then I'll go to the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Well, I just, well, I can affirm everything that I've heard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| I've really thought a great deal about this, really struggled with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| Ms. McGinnis, I'm really very confused about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| They may be a moving target, and I think I'm beginning to understand how it moves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| But that's not really the way I consider people that are the users,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| that are the ones who are really relying upon us, upon the city of Knoxville, and upon you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3712)|
| 1:01:59| to provide for them something that gives them a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| And basically, I think that's our obligation, is to give everybody equal opportunity to have a life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3724)|
| 1:02:13| as independent as we can, with as much quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| And I know that's what you endeavor to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| and I think you do so well with that in most of the services you provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| And I think this evening we've heard affirmation of the appreciation for the good service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| and the timely service that can be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| I'm just having a real problem with the moving numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| I'm having...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| They are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| I know they are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| But the people who have the needs are not moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| Their cause may be moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| And, you know, almost I see that if one attempts not to overuse the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| and be very grateful for it being there when they must have it, they really hurt their cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| Because then the numbers appear to be decreasing when actually those people are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3785)|
| 1:03:12| Now, this afternoon I talked to someone who actually lives in Councilman Hall's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| and she called because we've known her forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| I imagine many of you all know her because she and her husband had the vending concession at the security building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3801)|
| 1:03:30| I mean the safety building, for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| They happened to be patients of ours, and they were just dear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| He was completely sightless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| She had some vision at that time and could drive to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| Lovely people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Raised two fine boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| The boys found employment somewhere out of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| They're no longer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| James died two years ago, which has been very difficult for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| She's very lonely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| She lives just outside this three-quarter area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| Just outside it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| She has no way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| She has no friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| She's providing a wonderful service in her home every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| She has a group of people who have vision disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| They meet in her home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| She can't go anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| So great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| They come to her and they have a support group, which is terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| But, you know, that's just one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| She's one of two people I talked to this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| So, gee, I've talked half of the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| But just in a couple hours that I was home this afternoon, I'm kind of teasing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| But you see how we do hear from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| We hear the grateful people who benefit from these services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| who have to rely on us to be sure that their lives and legs aren't just cut right out from under them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| So I think you can see that most of us grapple with this very seriously because these are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| These are people who are looking to us for leadership and for support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| And, you know, I have to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| I think one of those engineering projects is in my district, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3911)|
| 1:05:18| Just one or maybe two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| Anyway, don't want to lose any of those things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| But on the other hand, this woman who called this afternoon, whom I can see that some of you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| made some very good suggestions about her experience on riding and using the lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3930)|
| 1:05:38| And in those comments, I thought, you know, I can see she has been concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| So she's been looking for ways to find efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| I think it might be so helpful to have some of these folks involved in trying to work out how routes can be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3949)|
| 1:06:00| Because I think they've had personal experiences that might offer some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| She spoke about being at UT Hospital the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| I think it was this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| Could have been last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| And she was waiting for a lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| And at the same time, someone else that she knew was waiting for a lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| But it was two different buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| They were coming to the same location at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| You know, that just may have just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| She gave me a couple of other examples that tell me that maybe we just kind of need to really see how we might find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=3992)|
| 1:06:41| to make this more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| And maybe it's not $125,000 a year from now that we need to restore these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4003)|
| 1:06:51| But thank you for letting me just make some comments that I just felt I wanted to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| Let me start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Ms. Roddy, you actually said something which I was listening to, but didn't have my pen in hand, about what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| And you said sort of a non-discriminatory, wonderful line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| And by the time you finished, I had my pen in the hand and started writing it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| but it was completely gone in my head by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| And it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| We need a policy that's fair, that's efficient, that gets this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| And I think we need to talk a little bit about who sets that and how it gets set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| I think I ultimately want to come around to disagreeing with Councilman Frost about saying let's put this off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| until down the road a little piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| And my first question is sort of who sets this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| And this is one I don't know if Mr. Woodhull or Mr. Swanson or Mr. Anderson can help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| but my understanding is we have a KTA board that sets policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| And, Mr. Woodhull, what I understood you to say is that the KTA board said no to this three-quarter mile limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| and yet it's being implemented September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| So I sort of have a question about, I mean, if the KTA board, the board that runs CAP, said no, we're not using this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4072)|
| 1:08:00| why is it being implemented September 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| Does anybody know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| I want to ask a question along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| You meet, the KTA board meets once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Can you tell us about what's been discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| And from your side, could you tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| We had a public hearing in July of last year, June of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| to discuss curtailing the lift service area to within three-quarters of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| And there was a laundry list of other efficiencies that we wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| And making changes to the lift service area, as Chris was saying, was not adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4114)|
| 1:08:41| And that, you're correct, I misstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| It wasn't that you refused to establish a three-quarter mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| It was just no cuts to the lift were accepted as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| Shortly after that meeting, I got an email, a budget directive from Sam Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| stating that there would be no take-home cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| There were several items on the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| and one of them was that the lift service area would revert back to the three-quarter miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| Is that correct, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| So Sam decides this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| No, no, Sam doesn't decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| The problem is the federal law states what the minimum standard is or what the going standard is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4162)|
| 1:09:32| We were inconsistent in how we were approving who got to ride used lift service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4172)|
| 1:09:43| We were inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| And in order to find consistency, if you remember last year during the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| when we were having financial problems because of the cost of fuel and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| the one thing that this council directed me to do was to be consistent in application of all policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| but to try to come up with ways to be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| And I think the easiest way to be efficient is to set rules that are reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| but also that take discretion away from staff at the lowest level who don't have all the information about budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4212)|
| 1:10:21| So that's where I was originally headed with the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| Well, what the board said was we'll just provide service to everybody that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| and send it back to council and council will pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| Because the board's job is to set policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| Council's job is to fund or to not to fund, and the council will pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| But once our budget was set, based on the economics at the time, it just wasn't possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4248)|
| 1:10:57| It wasn't possible because we had a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| We had certain expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| We would have exceeded our budget by several hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| if we didn't have a standard in which our employees could identify as this is the rule that we're going to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4267)|
| 1:11:16| And I thought the reasonable one was the federal standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| And I did send it to Cindy along with some other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| and I made sure that council knew about it last year at the budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| And I promised council that I would be consistent throughout this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| And to be truthful, I never say anything at council meetings, as you all well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| But one thing, over the last year, Cindy and I have attended 27 meetings relative to lift service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4297)|
| 1:11:46| Cindy is, I don't even want to know how many she's attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| I don't know how many that Larry has attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| But we've had dozens of internal and external meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| And we've met and we've met and we've met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| And we've identified the people that might be hurt by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| and we've done everything we could to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| And I met with some today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| I met with several today in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| And the thing was is misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| We are providing service to almost everybody that requests service that we can reasonably provide service for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4337)|
| 1:12:26| And we will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| But I would just ask this council to, as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| to understand that we are going to stay within an established budget that y'all set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| And whatever that budget is, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| And we will balance that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| And we will work hard every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| And we will follow the instructions that y'all give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| But understand, please do not give us a directive that's an unfunded mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4367)|
| 1:12:54| Because if it's not funded, we really can't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| we really have to do within whatever is administratively possible to balance the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4378)|
| 1:13:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| And that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| But it still raises the question of who decides this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| Because at some level what I'm hearing is city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| and the administration made a budgetary decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| said live within this budget and the CAT board isn't willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| And what you're saying is, well, we're just going to ignore the decision of the CAT board then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| No, the CAT board did not have a policy that set the limits of lift service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4405)|
| 1:13:36| So potentially lift service could be requested from somebody that lives in Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| and technically you could go, you know, you could provide the lift service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| In absence of a limitation, then the federal law prevails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4424)|
| 1:13:51| The federal regs prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| I mean, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| If there's no policy, we're just going to go with some policy that is out there that was written by the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| And that's the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Well, it's the only one that's in our, what we submitted to the feds in 1997,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4439)|
| 1:14:07| in that manual, that's the regulation, three-quarters of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| And I guess I'm just sort of concerned about what the role of the CAT board is in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4451)|
| 1:14:18| And let me say, the other thing I want to talk about is, I mean, we've been dealing with this for a year now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| and I don't think we're any closer, and I don't see the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| Well, let me say that after I hear from Chris, because I'm not sure even who decides this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| Mr. Anderson, you make it sound like we were aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| I know that the KTA board can't force CAT into a deficit budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| But we were not given options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| We were just asked to make a recommendation on that particular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| And we said that we didn't agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Now, you said because we failed to, I forgot, I didn't totally hear what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| We failed to make some kind of a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| It reverted back to the federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| No, I said that I reverted it back to what we submitted to the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| And if you wanted to make it consistent, you could have said, okay, five miles from the bus route to be more in line with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4513)|
| 1:15:24| historical generosity of our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| But it is not my understanding, and it is not the commissioners on KTA understanding that we set policy at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4529)|
| 1:15:39| So maybe we need to have a workshop about what our work is at KTA, because that's not how we understand our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4539)|
| 1:15:49| And we had a conversation about that at the KTA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| And we were told that we're responsible for bus routes and making recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4552)|
| 1:16:00| But the administration made the call, not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| Yeah, and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| And I felt like that's what I was doing when I sent the letter to Cindy, was making the call administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4569)|
| 1:16:17| And I sent all of you a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| And I reminded of you at last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| And we worked on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| We gave a six-month extension to identify the people that were outside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| We identified those people, came back in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| And then the mayor asked us to extend it for a future time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| We've had four meetings, two internal and two public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| And we addressed all issues and all concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| It came back to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| We're right where we were last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| We're asking to approve a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| And the budget needs to have administrative recommendations that are consistent and fair to all of our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4615)|
| 1:17:05| And I have no personal passion one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| I have two nephews that totally depend on the transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| They're disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| I understand where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| Most of our disabled residents ride regular routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| So when we cut routes, when you give us an option to either cut routes or cut transit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| or lay off people or those things, that's an administrative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| And we're willing to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| And I will make those decisions given that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| And I'm not passing the blame on anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| I'm making a recommendation to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| And I'm steadfast that what we've done and the work that we've done this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| is the only thing that we could do within our authority to bring a budget within reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4668)|
| 1:17:56| and to continue to provide the best transit service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| And I would argue that we still, even after this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| will be providing the best lift service of any city in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| And we wouldn't want to hold ourselves to such a low standard as the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| We'd like to be the best in the south or in the whole United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| But we do have fiscal responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| Let me just jump in real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| And then I'm going to go to Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| What I ask of all our department directors is your job is to help have your department meet the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| Last year, as you remember, we had a $450,000 amendment so that CAT could stay in budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| Am I right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| This year's budget has another $400,000 added to it on top of that $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| So, in effect, CAT's budget is up 10% before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| What we already have in this year's budget is up 10%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| when every other budget basically citywide is flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| So it's not like we're saying, gosh, we're begrudging with the transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| It's up 10% again when everything else is flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| And we have an awkward situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| CAT's job is to set the routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| But setting the routes is what basically sets the financial policy in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| That's what we spend money on is running the routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| And so they're setting the routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| We don't want to cut the routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| We say, okay, that's fine, but here's what the budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| So this is not somewhere where there's a good guy, bad guy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| Everybody is trying their hardest to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| And we as a city in a very tight time are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| And I understand the comments, you can't run the city like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| Well, unfortunately, we can't print money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| We can spend what we bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| And we've got to balance the budget every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| And we make hundreds of hard calls of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| whether it's having another police officer here, paying people more, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| We make hundreds of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| And so you can't take any decision just in a vacuum away from everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| And so in the end, I said to Sam and Debra, hey, every director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| your responsibility is to make sure your department meets budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| If it doesn't, it's your responsibility to react to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| And that's what Sam is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| So, Cindy, you were wanting to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| You know, even when the KTA makes a decision to modify a route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| they're impacting people who rely on that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| In effect, you might say they're making a policy to not serve this person in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| So perhaps the KTA should be charged with defining the lift service area as a route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4818)|
| 1:20:26| And right now we lack that guidance and that definition and that nondiscrimination factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| And KTA should be able to look, charge staff, you come up and you show us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| what does three-quarters of a mile cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| What does a mile cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| What does a mile and a half cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Where's our budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| And put the task back on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| And whatever happens, there will have to be another public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| I'm pretty confident that the federal regs require that any time you change the FTA service area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4849)|
| 1:20:59| that there has to be public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| And perhaps the KTA would be a better forum to look at the various alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| and then be charged with establishing a lift service area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| and not consider it a policy but just consider it the lift route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| What's the lift route going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| I offer that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| This is a very complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| And if it's any comfort, there are cities across the country grappling with the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| Vice Mayor, and then I'm going to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| If you're continuing this, if it's something new, there's other people that have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| No, no, it's still on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| And this is where I want to kind of argue that we should deal with this in the context of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| It might be impossible, but I want to make the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| One is that the budget is a time when we look at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| We balance everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| There are three other issues that I talked about last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| I mean, I very much want to add a zoning inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| I think we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Well, saying that's real easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| The real challenge of that is what do we take away to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| And I think now is the time that we're most focused on making that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| This is a budget issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| What's the budget for CAT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| This is a time when we say if we want to put another $125,000 into CAT to provide this service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| we've got to take it from someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| And now I think we should deal with this now, one, because now is the time we make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| We're clearest about what the other side of that scale is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| The other side, I'd say, on not putting this off is there was a public hearing last June about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| This has been going on for a year, and we're not anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| It sounds like we're not even clear who makes this decision after a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| And I don't know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| Maybe we can't decide it tonight, but I don't like this idea of saying let's just pass this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| and we'll figure it out later because we've been saying that for a year now and we haven't figured it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| So it's my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| I'm going to go to Councilman Horquist because he hasn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| Vice Mayor Becker, you said it's not clear as to who makes the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| Part of the problem is the way the system is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| KTA is a board that doesn't have the authority to function as a full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| It only can address routes and bus fares, which is, you know, the fare box revenue is only maybe less than 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4985)|
| 1:23:14| of the total revenue that CAT gets to operate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| Because it's city dollars primarily that fund the operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=4998)|
| 1:23:23| that has to be contained within the city administration and the city finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| because there is no dedicated source of revenue and most of it comes out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| So we're going to have this problem as long as it's structured the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| It's really kind of an oddball structure where the board has to make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| but it isn't accountable on the financial side and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| So it's just a weird system and it's been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| It's nobody's fault currently involved in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| It's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Until we can get a dedicated funding source and get a new structure to it, it's going to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| That's pertinent to the long-term discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| It doesn't deal with the problem at hand, but I felt like it was worth pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| I'm not certain who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| I'm going to go back to Mr. Frost because maybe it's his turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| We've been hearing the budget's getting ready to go into effect here in a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| but we've heard September 1st being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| When are these changes going to come into play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| Is it July 1 or is it September 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| Staff established September 1st as a date for the three-quarter mile boundary to be effective on weekdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5078)|
| 1:24:48| It's already effective on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| Second question, I confess I don't have my budget with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| and I can't remember where everything's coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| but in the cap budget there's a big bus wash in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| How much is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| About $300,000 if you want to get my AIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Marilyn Roddy's saying that's stimulus money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| It's coming from AIS, our wallets, but it's coming from a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| We can't reallocate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| I was just trying to think if we're looking for something quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| I'm glad to hear that we do have at least until September 1 to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5126)|
| 1:25:33| So right now the three-quarter mile radius applies Saturdays and Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5133)|
| 1:25:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| You're saying it's $125,000 difference between how it is presently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| and going to a three-quarter mile distance seven days a week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| That's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| It was approximately a $10,000 a month savings for weekends and weekdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5156)|
| 1:26:05| Back in November we went ahead and instituted the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| We've already realized some savings from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| And CAC is taking the work trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| So we're realizing I estimate it was probably about $2,000 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| to continue the grandfathering program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| But the grandfathering issue has other implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| because it's a discriminatory situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| And you can't, you know, I brought up in the past the idea of charging for greater distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5195)|
| 1:26:43| Is that not an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| We can do that outside of the three-quarter mile boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| Inside the three-quarter mile boundary we can only charge twice what we charge on the regular fixed routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| How would charging outside of the three-quarter boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| how would it help meet that difference in cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| That was one of the issues that this discussion group had targeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| as perhaps something that we could discuss in more detail going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| We know what our hourly rate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| We can sometimes project fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| I mean, would it help close the gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Well, I guess it's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Would you want to charge the full $30 cost for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| I mean, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| I mean, you can charge real cost and have it totally close the gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| but I don't know that's going to be realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| No, I'm just trying to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Everybody in this room is trying to figure out some way we can get from A to B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| So it's a point of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| Councilman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| I feel like the thing that we're missing here is the big picture of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| We have a set amount of revenue that we can spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| And should we choose we don't have line item, you know, power within CAT's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| We have the ability to say CAT has X amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| And, Mr. Anderson, right now it costs the city of Knoxville to provide the whole transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| Is it about $9 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| That's real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Net of any fare box revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| The supplement to provide transportation is about $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| That's a huge chunk of very important change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| I mean, we're providing a very, very important service to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| So is police and fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| So are fixing intersections that the engineering department looks at that are not functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| There's a lot of things in terms of the health and safety of our citizens that are very important for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| And, you know, we've got to look at this piece within the scope of the whole budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| If we want to spend more than $9 million on CAT and provide service within five miles of every route to lift service, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5327)|
| 1:28:55| But that means we have fewer police officers or we have fewer firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| We have less money to renovate a fire station this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| We have less money to renovate recreation centers this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| I mean, it's a balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| And I, for one, think that we have to have a consistent non-discriminatory policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5350)|
| 1:29:18| When it comes to the Americans with Disabilities Act, the federal government and all of us that live under the Constitution have said we cannot discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5358)|
| 1:29:26| It's got to be fair for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| And right now what we are doing is discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| We are driving out to Straw Plains to provide lifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| We are not driving to other parts of the city to provide rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| We are taking riders who live in the city, is this correct, Ms. McGinnis, and delivering them to points outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| We are picking – it's – I mean, to me, I think we're in a tremendous position of liability where we are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5384)|
| 1:29:52| because someone who is being injured by this discriminatory policy could come to the city and say this isn't fair, this isn't right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5392)|
| 1:30:02| We have got to take responsibility for a system that's definable and fair for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| And the federal government says three-quarters of a mile is a reasonable place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| I, for one, think that's what we need to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| If we go into next year and we find out that this is horribly injurious to folks and we need to expand it to a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5415)|
| 1:30:23| then let's do that, but let's do that within the context of the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| We're not going to renovate a fire station next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| We're going to have fewer officers on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| I mean, $9 million is what we're spending to provide transit as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| And the other piece is, you know, as Ms. McGinnis says, we're not even talking about –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| when CAT looks at eliminating a whole route, there's an awful lot of people that are impacted there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| who maybe aren't disabled but choose not to own automobiles or cannot afford to own automobiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| or for whatever reason, for the environment, they choose to ride that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| And it's a much bigger impact than I think the small piece we're looking at here in terms of the size of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5453)|
| 1:31:01| and the size of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| And I applaud Mr. Anderson for taking responsibility for his departments and his budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| and for saying the buck stops here and I was charged with making a decision and this is what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| And I think we're charged with making the same kind of decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| The buck needs to stop with us in terms of a balanced budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| And I think the budget that's in front of us that we deliberated for quite some time yesterday is a good one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| and does a good job of balancing those priorities of public safety, of health and welfare and recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5486)|
| 1:31:33| and providing public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| So I would move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| Well, actually, it's already been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| Yeah, so that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| I'm going to go ahead since there's lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| I appreciate it, but Steve – or Councilman Hall, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| This is for Ms. McGinnis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| I guess I'm just confused because if I – and correct me if I misstate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| because there's all kinds of stuff been going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I don't think anybody really knows what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| But your – the lift service is as it was six months ago right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5520)|
| 1:32:09| It's going to continue that way until September the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| What is continuing until September the 1st if that's not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| Well, let me see if I can take a stab at that and make sure if I guess right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| The folks who are serving outside the three-quarter mile on either side of a fixed route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| and those folks who we have been delivering service to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| we would continue to deliver service to those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| And that's all that was proposed to do until September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| And that's on Monday through Friday, not Saturday and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| Then my question is the lady that was – that had the – and I forget her name –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| that brought the three individuals up that was talking about the one that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| if I think I've got this correct, that she – that the young lady used to ride the lift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| but now she has to go to CAC because she can't ride the lift anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| then that sounds like that they've already cut that service from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| The work-related trips were transitioned to CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| when they got the grant to fund providing those trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| And CAC would appreciate hearing about the service delivery concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| Anything else, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| I think I'm thoroughly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| Well, just let me say, the folks who were being serviced on work-related trips outside that three-quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| who we historically had been serving, CAC got the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| and got a grant to take care of those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| And obviously there's some service issues that have been expressed with those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| but they – that's why that number went from whatever number it was down to a lower number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| because CAC started being responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| I'm going to go to Councilman Pelo and then to the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| I have so much respect for so many people who work so hard at CAC and offer such good services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| but I have to tell you that that service, I mean, I'm sure they have heard the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5644)|
| 1:34:12| If we have heard the concerns and we have experienced the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5652)|
| 1:34:20| I've personally experienced people who have come to a professional office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| and had to sit for four hours to wait for someone to come back for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| So I know how difficult it is for them to get the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| The problem is you provide great services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| and people can live their lives on somewhat of a schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| and expect to arrive and return from an appointment or a necessary visit somewhere within reasonable time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5683)|
| 1:34:54| There's just no comparison, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| And I don't know what the problem is there, but we're not dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| But I'm concerned about this discrimination situation because I see this as discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| If these people, however many there happen to be, had the services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5706)|
| 1:35:13| and they've had them for all these many years they've lived in these locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| and these people didn't just all of a sudden appear on your need rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| They've had these needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| They've been using the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| Now, tell me how we're not discriminating when we decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| because they live on the other side of the street, well, it's not really that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| because I understand how you suggest they get to a bus stop or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| That's not possible for many people where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| And, you know, to be honest with you, I would say most people who live in most neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| well, for instance, in Councilman Hollis' district and my district, because it's very spread out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| it's neighborhoods, it's not, you know, like the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| And I would say those people are all going to be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| Now, whether they have needed the services or not, if that's to hush me up, it won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5767)|
| 1:36:17| I have very little brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| I think Mr. Anderson just passed that right down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| Anyway, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Then we're going to give you credit for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| No, but, I mean, I have a serious problem with that, because to me I would feel discriminated against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5787)|
| 1:36:33| I have a serious concern about that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| And I don't see why that isn't being discriminated against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| If I'm a city taxpayer and I own a home within the corporate limits of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| and I cannot get the same benefits that other city taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| Let me take a crack at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| Right now we don't have bus lines that go through every neighborhood as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| So right now we don't have transportation that goes everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| So we set up certain routes that we are serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| So to say we're going to serve every citizen with a lift is a whole different question than what we're talking about now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5821)|
| 1:37:08| Those people who have purchased those homes and intentionally live in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| because they understood that those services were going to be available, and we have heard that here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| then I would feel that I had really been discriminated against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| I think that, and I guess Debbie, you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| I think a concern that we have is that without a policy that says we're going to serve this prescribed territory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5846)|
| 1:37:36| we don't feel comfortable that we're not discriminating by saying we're going to take you but not you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| And we have some long-term concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Well, I understand how very complicated it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| But, you know, a year ago I really thought that the board, the CAT board, and that CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5865)|
| 1:37:56| I thought this was going to all be worked on very, I thought it was a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| Because we had these same discussions and the same faces before us a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| So I'm just very frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| You all won't be here a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| I mean, that might be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| But on the other hand, it's a disappointing thing not to resolve an issue that's been before us for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| Let me just, if people miss this, there was gum going down, and that was what Ms. Pilo was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| she made the comment, if you're trying to hush me up, let me just say, being that Councilman Frost will not miss this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| is that if offering gum was a way to shut people up, Ms. Pilo, you and I would never have to buy gum, I can guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5915)|
| 1:38:43| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| Took a second off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| I'm glad Ms. Rowdy sort of made that comment of this is a balancing, you know, we have things to choose here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5933)|
| 1:39:01| And I guess at one level, there is this question of if we think the lift service going longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5941)|
| 1:39:09| covering more people, whatever, is worth more, we've got to put the money up, and that means we've got to take it from someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| But sort of before we can begin that, I guess there is a question for either, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| the board rep or Ms. McGinnis or Mr. Anderson about what does $125,000 pay for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5961)|
| 1:39:28| If this board in its wisdom says, yes, we want the lift expanded, and we're going to give you $125,000 more to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5968)|
| 1:39:37| or let's say $100,000, much easier math, $100,000, what does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| What I would propose doing is going out and figuring what that equates to in a service boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5984)|
| 1:39:51| And we haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| The $125,000 now is to keep doing what we're doing now, but which we're saying we don't feel comfortable continuing to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=5994)|
| 1:40:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| So, and I guess this is a little bit of what Councilman Woodall talked about of not having the KTEA board not getting options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| that have we sat down and said as a budgeting factor to ask city council in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6009)|
| 1:40:21| this amount of money will do X, Y, or Z for our policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| I mean, what we've said is with the current budget, it's three-quarters of a mile within a fixed route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| But do we have any thinking that says $25,000 does this much more, $100,000 does this much more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6030)|
| 1:40:38| Do we know any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| We can make some estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| I haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| There will still be probably people impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| And right now, the policy is going to be a three-quarter mile, and that is no budget change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6053)|
| 1:41:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| So if council wants to change that three-quarter mile thing, what we should do is put up some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6063)|
| 1:41:16| SAM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| One of the problems that we have is there's other things that factor in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| If you remember, we asked to change express service and several other things that collectively all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6082)|
| 1:41:30| in addition to being inconsistent with the lift service, is driving us to be in excess of our funded budget each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6090)|
| 1:41:42| So to say to put $125,000 back in there, we still are submitting to county to eliminate the halls express route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6102)|
| 1:41:53| to reduce the Farragut express route, and we're doing some things in our operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6113)|
| 1:42:01| We're negotiating things in the contract, trying to limit the growth of the total cap budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6121)|
| 1:42:07| So to add $125,000 does not necessarily mean that we can even balance the budget next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| So I would be leery of thinking that that would be a solution that would enable us to provide the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6134)|
| 1:42:21| We're going to continue every day to work hard at trying to run the most efficient transit system we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6141)|
| 1:42:28| and as we bring on the transit center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| the operation cost for that is probably going to run somewhere between $250,000 and $500,000 additional a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| and we're going to have to do a lot of rerouting of our existing transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| So transit will be on the agenda for council at least a dozen times over the course of the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6163)|
| 1:42:51| So please don't think that any one decision is going to enable us to just put it to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6171)|
| 1:42:59| I think that's the fairest way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| Councilwoman Hull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Before this three-quarter decision, what would you have said the policy is if you had just to say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6185)|
| 1:43:16| I would say that the policy was that we complied with the three-quarter mile service limit boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6196)|
| 1:43:24| plus we provided services to disabled individuals within the core area of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6204)|
| 1:43:34| that might be slightly beyond the three-quarter mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| plus we provided services to certain annexed areas but not to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6217)|
| 1:43:44| So it wasn't the entire city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| We have not served Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| We've served Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| That's the easiest example I can give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| I definitely understand the notion of creating a more uniform policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6237)|
| 1:44:03| but it just seems like we've swung heavily in the direction of limiting access to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6243)|
| 1:44:11| in a way that I don't feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| And the numbers are finite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| We're talking 12 individuals maybe now who are still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| And we were concerned that without a clear policy, we could get ourselves into trouble in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6262)|
| 1:44:30| I was concerned about that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| Ms. McGinnis, prior to the meeting, I happened to run into you outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| and you had a map with you that showed what the three-quarter mile boundary would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| if enacted relative to the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| And I don't know whether that's a document that you'd like to pass around to councilmembers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| but it was interesting to me what a small amount visually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| percentage-wise of the city of Knoxville's land area was not overlaid with that three-quarter mile boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6298)|
| 1:45:05| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| Is that something that you could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Yes, I can get it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| Those of you who are here, and this is an intensely personal issue, too, we very much appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| I think all of council appreciates the fact that you're here and listening intently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| And we know you're passionate about it, but you're here expressing your thoughts but not cheering and booing, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6320)|
| 1:45:28| I think we appreciate the trouble you've come to to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| And believe me, we want to work out something that works for you but works for the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| I think you understand the dilemma and we appreciate the way you're comporting yourself, I guess I'll put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6336)|
| 1:45:42| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| We're obviously not going to solve this issue tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| Thankfully, we don't have an immediate deadline of the end of this month to make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6348)|
| 1:45:58| I like Councilman Becker's idea of, you know, what does X number of dollars do to the three-quarter mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6358)|
| 1:46:08| I respectfully request that Ms. McGinnis or the CAT board or the advisory board or whoever the appropriate body is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6368)|
| 1:46:18| to determine some cost analysis of what an increase to that would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6378)|
| 1:46:27| And if that is shared with the people at the Disability Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| So hopefully, you know, we can reach, if we can't reach consensus, we can come close to a consensus of if we do a reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6392)|
| 1:46:43| how many people is this going to affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| I understand the numbers are fluid, but I'd like to see a closer range of, you know, what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6406)|
| 1:46:54| We really don't want to cut people off and limit interaction with others, with their jobs, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6414)|
| 1:47:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Mr. Frost, your suggestion would be we move on with the budget and we take this up when we have some hard numbers down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6429)|
| 1:47:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| I don't think, I think you heard Mr. Anderson say, well, $125,000 is a place to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6438)|
| 1:47:25| but that's not necessarily the ending point to paraphrase, and please correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6445)|
| 1:47:32| But, you know, September 1st, there's a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| It is an important issue, but let's try to get some numbers about what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6456)|
| 1:47:43| I mean, like I said, look at all the change orders we have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| They're good projects and they will pass with little to no debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| but we have a project that is very important to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6471)|
| 1:47:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| I tend to think as long as we keep the mentality of saying it's a tradeoff, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| if we do add money to the lift service, we take it from someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| We keep that thinking because sometimes we lose track of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| I actually want to make a comment on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| It has these green and red dots on it that are homes and locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| and I don't know if people in the audience have seen the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| but most of the city looks like it is covered and there's a chunk sort of in northwest that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| And interestingly, it looks like three-quarters of the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| the green dots that are houses, are in an area that's not covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| And I'm wondering, can you explain the map, Cindy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6517)|
| 1:48:46| I really can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| The TPO did that map and they made all types of disclaimers when they handed the map out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6527)|
| 1:48:54| They said it was just for visual references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| I would have to go back and get the actual address that they were referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6537)|
| 1:49:02| but I can certainly look into that pocket and see what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| I actually think Mr. Frost's idea makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| but it was interesting to see that and see a small part of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| that had a large concentration of people who looked like they wanted rides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| and that was part of what was excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| It seems questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| Okay, Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| Let me see if I understand this map correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| If all this area, all up in through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| that's in this shaded color that says that that's within three-quarters of a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| if somebody lives in all that area and they can call and get the Lyft service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| I am going to further complicate this by explaining that it doesn't matter where you live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| It matters where your trip originates and where it ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| You can live in Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| and your aunt can bring you into West Town Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| and the Lyft will pick you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| You're right, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| Anywhere inside that whatever peach or khaki shaded area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| you can originate a trip and end a trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Is that correct that they have to start and end inside that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| Well, obviously this is an important discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| and people's lives are going to be greatly impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| I just want to point out, and we don't have time to get into it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| at some point we will report on this trip to Charlotte that we had 25 people from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6642)|
| 1:50:49| went on a fact-finding mission last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| What we saw there was a city that has decided to transform itself using public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| They are shaping the future of their city using public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| They've made a massive investment, Charlotte and Mecklenburg County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| using a dedicated funding source, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| And by doing that, it changes the equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| and where you have this map for Knoxville showing a critical service being distributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6672)|
| 1:51:19| on an as-needed basis all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| what you're finding in places like Charlotte is that fixed-rail bus systems and fixed-guideway systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| in their case light rail and streetcar, either existing or coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| are providing those services to a tremendous percentage of the population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| those with special needs and those that don't have special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| So as important as this discussion is, I hope it will help us move to the next level eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6700)|
| 1:51:47| and talk about how we begin to do what other cities are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| and make transit begin to be front and foremost in importance for our entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6710)|
| 1:51:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| Councilwoman Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| Cindy, could you provide one of those maps to each of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| And we just had a moment to glance at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| I would really like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| I had to get these from the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| I hadn't seen this map in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| It was passed out at a meeting in September, and I'll ask the TPO to get a set of maps for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| I guess, seeing no lights on CAT, I was going to bring up some other potential issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6745)|
| 1:52:32| but before I do that, does anybody want to say anything more about CAT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| Because I don't want to cut that off prematurely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| Well, let me say where I understand council is, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6759)|
| 1:52:43| is that no final decisions, what you're wanting to say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| what I'm maybe paraphrasing Councilman Frost is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| because the servicing will change September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| I understand your desire to get it, and we want to get it solved, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| Can we see what buying additional distances cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| And I think everybody understands that we can't just kind of go on a piecemeal basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| But if we decide to further that boundary out, Ken and Cindy, I'll defend Cindy a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6785)|
| 1:53:11| it's a little hard because it's not always a consistent number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| She probably can't come up with a hard dollar, but I think we can try to come for a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| Cindy, shoot me if I'm wrong, or shoot me a dirty look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| and try to say, okay, well, if we did it to a mile on each side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| it would be approximately this much more or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| Let me just one more question about CAP that just hit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| In the distance from a fixed route, is that irregardless of political boundaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6815)|
| 1:53:41| Can we say something that if you're, you know, we cannot take political boundaries into impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6821)|
| 1:53:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| If the route is at the edge of the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| and you live within three-quarters of a mile and you're outside the city, we would have to pick you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| If we extend it to a mile, would we have to do that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| If we cannot just use the corporate limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| Federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| And that's kind of crazy since that's the budget that we pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| You did say it was federal law, so you didn't need to say it was crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| Yeah, I guess from the budget discussion we had yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| there were three ideas that I talked about that I want to follow up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| And I'll try and be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| I know it's even later than we were last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| So the first thing I talked about is some changes in the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| And I know Mr. Lawler is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| And in the interest of time, I'm going to just try and summarize what I think he would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| And if you want to come down and correct me if I get it wrong on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| in looking at the proposal that Mr. Lawler made yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| I was under the impression that we were actually in a deficit of case managers right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| I looked at the numbers, and it looked like at this very moment we were well behind for all the 200 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| who were already housed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| Mr. Lawler has told me, and you've all gotten an e-mail about this, that we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| that there currently are enough case managers at KCDC, Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6917)|
| 1:55:26| and especially Volunteer Ministry Center to handle all the folks that are currently on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| and that what the deficit that's talked about in the funding for case managers is for housing future people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6931)|
| 1:55:38| And as I understand it, we're not going to be housing folks before we get case managers for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| Did I say that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| John Lawler, I'm 400 Main Street, Director of Tenure Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| Yes, everything you said is true, that in the numbers we presented to you yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| with the 55,000 we're getting from the city to our office for case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| that added to the other capacities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| We have enough case management funded for everyone in Permanent Support for Housing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| whether it's in KCDC housing or in the other housing that VMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| and others have placed chronically homeless individuals in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| So I'm good if, I didn't exactly see a crowd of people jumping to support my idea yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| but I'm okay with where things have added if everything else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| The second thing I talked about yesterday was related to Walter P. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| And my sense, and I confirmed this actually with Alvin Nance today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| is that projects before that have been funded for a HOPE VI project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| the city government has put up 25 to 35 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| We're talking about putting up 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| We have the advantage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| KCDC has done a great job of making sure nobody else in the state is applying for a HOPE VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| So we're going to do better than it would have been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| What I'd like to do, currently the city is committing $8 million to this $80 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| I'd like to make a motion to take $1 million out of our general fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| and transfer that into capital to move that funding from the city up to $9 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7035)|
| 1:57:20| which is a slight increase in the percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| I think that gives us a slight increase in the chance of getting $20 million from the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| to make some significant changes at Walter P. Taylor with a new HOPE VI project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| That was a motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| For discussion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| I'm not saying I'll vote for it, but I'll second it just for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| I'm going to give my quick opinion and then I'm going to ask some of KCDC who owns more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| I appreciate the sentiment and I really want to see this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| I'm not certain that we need to do that until we get another step further down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| but I'm going to let KCDC comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| I'm Dan Tiller, 901 Broadway with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7081)|
| 1:58:06| When we received our first HOPE VI in 1998, there was $600 million available from HUD for that purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7086)|
| 1:58:14| and now there's only $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| So if all five of the winners get $20 million, that's only five HOPE VI's throughout the entire United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7097)|
| 1:58:27| So it's going to be very competitive, highly competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| And the leverage requirements now are much greater than they were in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| And just in the year 2000, Chattanooga received HOPE VI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| and their council provided $20 million for city funds for that project, and it was an $80 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7121)|
| 1:58:51| So the more money we have, the better off we are, but, you know, we've still got a long way to go to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| Would it help having the additional commitment at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| or do we just need to be able to do it at such point as we make it to the next run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| We would have to have the commitment before we apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| It would have to be in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| So you're saying it would make if what Councilman or Vice Mayor Becker is suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| if council voted to do that, that would help the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7158)|
| 1:59:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| Councilman Hoekstra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| Your motion was to amend to add an additional million, and my second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| So I think this is evidence that you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7174)|
| 1:59:41| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| I want to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| So I'll think about it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| Mr. Tiller, when do you all intend to apply for this where if there's additional funding it would be of benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7187)|
| 1:59:56| Well, we're waiting on the notice of funding availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| It has not come out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| We expected it a couple of months ago, but HUD's been tied up with all this other monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7201)|
| 2:00:07| and they just haven't put it out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| We expect it to be out at least sometime this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| and then they'll probably give us a 90-day period in which to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| Larry, do you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| Just a general comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| I likewise had a conversation with Vice Mayor Becker about this along with Alvin Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7224)|
| 2:00:31| Again, the origin of the $8 million is the exact number that KCDC asked us to fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7231)|
| 2:00:39| which we were glad to be able to recommend in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| I would also remind council that the capital budget as proposed is $27 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| versus in the past couple of years we've had capital budgets of around $37 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| So to make this commitment, while not all of the $8 million is in this capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7255)|
| 2:01:02| this is still a significant number that not only do we have to fund this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| but if we are fortunate enough to get the project, have to find funding for it in each of the subsequent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7267)|
| 2:01:14| The other thing that I would mention to council that Mr. Nance and I talked about today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| was that there are different ways to look at the leverage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| When we had a previous HOPE project, the grant was $20-some-odd million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| and our participation, which was in the form of a loan, was $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7290)|
| 2:01:37| So somewhere around 18% of the leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7297)|
| 2:01:42| If we get a $20 million grant this time from HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| we're talking $8 million versus that $20 million or a 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7306)|
| 2:01:51| So depending on how you look at the leverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| there's lots of different dollars that are used that are part of leveraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7314)|
| 2:02:00| That original project was $40 million in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| We had $2.5 million or 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| This time we're talking $80 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| We have $8 million or 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| So I think that it's noteworthy that that's the amount that KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| and their work and Mr. Nance and all of KCDC have done a yeoman's job working this across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7335)|
| 2:02:23| talking with the other communities, determining what the competition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| They felt comfortable asking for the $8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| and there's not many people, certainly within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| that ask for a certain amount and always get what they ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| But this is what they asked for and what we were recommending to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| Councilman Holquist, and then I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| Mr. Martin, obviously, as you indicated, the leveraging part of this could be sliced more than one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7367)|
| 2:02:56| But you were talking about in future budgets we'd have to come up with additional leveraging funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| The future value, I guess you could argue it different ways in terms of when it's easiest to come up with that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7383)|
| 2:03:10| But it seems like one argument, and I'm not, again, I'm not taking a position on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| I haven't decided how I'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| But one argument might be that if we know we've got to set aside funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7396)|
| 2:03:22| a significant amount of funds for that block of leveraging money that it may make sense out of this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7402)|
| 2:03:29| to go ahead and put a substantial amount into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| And, of course, that's only committed if, my understanding is it's only committed if we get the HOPE VI money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7412)|
| 2:03:40| I know KCDC is committed to the project one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| But everything changes, it's my understanding, if we don't get the HOPE VI grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| So from a competitive standpoint and from the standpoint of is it going to be harder to come up with the money in future budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7428)|
| 2:03:59| you know, I'm just wondering where that puts us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| And I know you don't have, nobody has easy answers for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| I mean, they really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| But it just seems to me like it is worth looking at doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7447)|
| 2:04:13| I don't know if you don't have to respond if you don't want to, but I'm just kind of throwing that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| Again, not to blow with the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| we thought that the way we took the $8 million and spread it was a fair and equitable way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7464)|
| 2:04:31| It is loaded toward later years, which will be challenges for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7471)|
| 2:04:37| But we had to take into consideration what our overall capital budget was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| and what we thought was an appropriate amount consistent with all the other requests and needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| which I can tell you again represented probably twice what we were able to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7485)|
| 2:04:52| So there are lots of other worthy projects that, unfortunately, if you were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| I would just ask you to think about if you were to put a million dollars more into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| that you really didn't consider what those other projects might have been that were funding requests that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7501)|
| 2:05:08| that we had to go through and make some conscious decisions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| and make what we thought were reasonable, fair, and good recommendations to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7511)|
| 2:05:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7518)|
| 2:05:19| I guess two thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| If we don't get the project, we get the money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| I mean, it's pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| If you recall the beginning of the discussion about CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| Bill Dockery said some really interesting things about the role of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| which I was impressed with, about how government is not a shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| We are not storekeepers just working to balance a budget here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090602?start=7534)|
