| 0:03:15| Yes. Councilwoman Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Yes. Okay, motion to approve the minutes passes 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=198)|
| 0:03:27| Now on to the agenda. Are there any items that Councilmembers wish to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=207)|
| 0:03:36| Okay, any items Councilmembers wish to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| Councilman Roberto? Thank you, Mayor. I'd like to postpone item 12 F and item 12 H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=221)|
| 0:03:49| I think those both need some more time for some public discussion and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| I'll second that. Okay, so there's a motion on the floor by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| Councilmember Roberto to postpone item 12 F and 12 H, seconded by Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| Any discussion? How long for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| Oh, two weeks. For two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| Any other questions or discussion? Seeing none, please do a roll call vote about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| this postponement of two items, 12 F and H for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=263)|

| 0:05:14| Seeing none, how about items requested to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| Okay, let's move on to the consent agenda. Items 11 K through 11 R pensions and item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=318)|

| 0:05:52| Councilwoman Ryder, excuse me, Parker? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| Councilwoman Ryder? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| Councilman Roberto? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| Councilman Singh? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| Councilman Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| Councilman Testerman? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| Councilman Thomas? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Okay, the consent agenda is approved 9-0. Next item is my report to you. So first and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=377)|
| 0:06:28| foremost on everyone's mind is our response in COVID-19. As you all know, we are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| progress as a community, and I appreciate everyone's patience, understanding, and willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| to help look after one another. We have flattened the curve. We have built up supplies of PPEs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| The health department has worked hard to increase availability of tests, and our hospitals have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| collaborated to create capacity in case we experience a surge in illness. So as again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| you all are very familiar, last Friday we took the first steps to gradually start reopening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| some non-essential businesses, and I just want to emphasize that this is not a return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| to pre-pandemic normals. We are many, many months away from being back to normal, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| so we are opening very slowly in phases. Phase 1 started May 1st and is going to last 28| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=433)|
| 0:07:21| days minimum, and at that time we will decide whether to pause, move forward, or if need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=441)|
| 0:07:30| be go back, depending on the health metrics of our community. The health department has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| a great website, and they've added more and more data to that every day, and I publish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| with our communications team a dashboard every day that sort of lists the daily update and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| also the change from the previous day. And I think one of the most important data points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| is the number of active cases, and that has thankfully been very low and continues to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| remain pretty low, but obviously all of us are monitoring it very closely. So it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| also to remember that nobody is required to reopen, but if you're permitted to, as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| as you follow the guidelines that the health department has set forth. And you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| that, but I'll just mention this to anyone who might be watching from the public, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| read all of the guidelines and get FAQs and to find out who, if you have particular questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=506)|
| 0:08:33| of a particular type of business, go to the health department website, covid.knoxcountytn.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| There's parts to set forth the benchmarks, there's particular guidance by business sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| and all that sort of thing. I just want to again thank the health department, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| been working really hard, and their website is really good and keeps getting better and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| adding more information and more transparency. And I do expect midway through phase one to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=538)|
| 0:09:06| get a report back from the health department with their expert opinion on what those metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| say. The metrics right now are all, they're complex things, not a single measure, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| each one is in the green phase. They're green saying it's okay to be gradually reopening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| but if they go to yellow or red, that'll be an opportunity to, that'll be a time to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| other actions. So everyone is encouraged, even though we're doing this reopening, to take it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=570)|
| 0:09:39| slow and always, in all the phases, we have to continue to practice physical distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| wear cloth face coverings in public, practice proper hand washing, sanitize surfaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| and work remotely if you can. I want to thank all council members for all your engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| you know, on everything, but in particular during this pandemic, you guys have been asking great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| questions, learning the details inside and out, helping research what other cities are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| and offering good suggestions. And I think this is really important, is communicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| the city's actions and just the general pandemic information to our various constituencies. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| you know, we put out a lot of communications, but you all have your own channels and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| other ways of communicating, and that's really important. I think many, if not all, council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| members had an opportunity to participate in a seminar last week with Dr. Buchanan. She met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=628)|
| 0:10:37| members of the City Council and County Commission two different times on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| giving an overview and answering questions about the reopening. So you can re-watch those if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| want to, or watch the one that you didn't participate in, and so can members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| Thank you for being so engaged and for setting good examples. And also, we were one of the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=653)|
| 0:11:01| elected groups in the in the state of Tennessee to go to these virtual meetings, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| again, while it's not as not preferable to in-person, we've done a good job, and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| all your patience with that. So later on in today's agenda, we'll be talking about the COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| budget proposal, and as you know, this pandemic has had a huge impact in a negative way on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=681)|
| 0:11:31| emotional and financial existence of our community. A lot of families are really struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| to find work and to pay their bills, and that's why in my FY21 budget, I've outlined a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| of more than $4.1 million to support the community's response to the pandemic and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| immediate needs facing our residents. The single largest investment is to help with housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| More than $1.1 million would go to direct rent and mortgage payment assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| and we'll get more into those details later on in the agenda. So another thing that I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| some of you have been involved with is our effort to encourage people and normalize the wearing of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=727)|

| 0:12:57| Council as role models, and you know, if we do it, maybe that'll encourage other people to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| that this is a way to protect our neighbors, and it's just what I call common courtesy in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| COVID era, like that's what we need to be doing. Let's see, I wanted to announce that today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=789)|
| 0:13:20| I appointed Harold Cannon as the new Director of Engineering. Steve King is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| interim director, and I know Steve's on this call. Thank you for being a great interim, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| Mr. Cannon is going to take office in June, so Steve King remains our acting director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| until that time, and we'll stay on under Mr. Cannon as well. So Harold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| Cannon has had an exemplary career, done all kinds of work in the public and private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| and I'm thrilled that he's joining our team. He's got great relationships and experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| and has a lot of credibility in the development community and within the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=840)|

| 0:14:11| to the City's 3-1-1 Center for Service Innovation, because the two supervisors and five customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=851)|

| 0:14:25| pandemic, and today happens to be their birthday. 15 years ago, May 5, 2005, 3-1-1 launched, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| happy 15th birthday. Just a little overview of the caliber and scale of work they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| They assist 250,000 residents a year, answering questions about city services and requests for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| help for everything from overgrown lots to potholes to missing street signs. Since March, 3-1-1 has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| been a main source of contact for people seeking guidance about how businesses and people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| affected by the various state Knox County Health Department and city public safety protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| Russ Jensen and his team had created a chat bot to answer questions about Census 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| and when the pandemic hit us, they quickly added capacity to that chat bot to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| after hours about the pandemic, so thank you to Russ and his team. More recently, 3-1-1 has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=917)|
| 0:15:26| been a resource for businesses and residents as they have questions about the reopening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| and also a resource for when they want to report concerns about compliance with the Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| Department guidelines. So just so you know, most businesses, I'm really proud to say that most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| businesses are willingly complying with the Health Department regulations, and when we hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| concerns, you know, the Health Department or sometimes city staff go out, and our first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| second, and third efforts are all about educating and informing and just building those relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| so they understand why those health guidelines are there in the first place. And you probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| know this, but you know, since we've had this pandemic and various, you know, public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| regulations, we've had more than 400 complaints come to 3-1-1, and of those 400, we've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| we've issued nine warnings and only one single civil citation, so the group of, you know, people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| working on enforcement have done a great job on educating and building that up in a positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| So the other good thing about 3-1-1 taking a lot of those calls is that it frees up the Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| Department to answer actual health questions. So if you have questions that, you know, 3-1-1 can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| answer about business, about rules, and that sort of thing, you call 3-1-1 and they can help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| If you have a question about should I get a test or not, that's when you call 2-1-5, 5-5-5-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1011)|
| 0:16:59| for your Health Department specific concerns. So anyhow, just since March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1019)|
| 0:17:08| 19,000 total calls received by 3-1-1, 7,000 of them have been related to COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| so 120 calls per person per day, and the average wait time is just 30 seconds. And they also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| in addition to that, manage the 2-1-1 line, which is a way that people can get connected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| food resources, mental health services, utility, and rent assistance. So just wanted to say happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1047)|
| 0:17:34| birthday to 3-1-1, and thanks to Russ Jensen and the whole team. You're doing great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1054)|

| 0:18:01| as businesses have started to rephase their openings, there's been a lot of concern that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| some of the small businesses, either because of financial reasons or because of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| just the sheer supply of not being able to secure PPE, we kind of are working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1094)|

| 0:18:29| face masks, and are working on some other supplies. But to help create a starter kit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| if you will, for these small businesses to at least help them get their doors open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| there's a Facebook page that's been created called Small Business Care Knox, and so if there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| small businesses out there that either haven't opened or haven't opened as a result or are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1129)|

| 0:19:03| then they can send a message through that Facebook page, and we will direct them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1143)|

| 0:26:54| good evening. I hope you and your families are doing well during these trying times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| I come before you today to present our reasonings why the variance regarding 4110 Sevierville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| should be approved. The City of Knoxville Planning and Building Inspection Services are provided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| serve the citizens of Knoxville regarding safety. The circular driveway, which was there when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| bought the property, is the safest alternative. Parking on the road is a major safety concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1639)|
| 0:27:28| I understand that the issue is the driveway setback. It is recorded that the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| was previously in the same location. We just paved the driveway to improve the safety and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1653)|

| 0:27:47| is coming from Virginia Heights subdivision, not Sevierville Pike. This was before the zoning board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1667)|

| 0:28:02| people driving on the wrong side of the road to enter the driveway in the past. If the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1682)|

| 0:28:14| wrong side of the road to enter. It is assumed that people driving have a valid driver's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| and follow the rules of the road. Keeping the driveway where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| is the safest alternative to benefit the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| The lack of access due to the topography of the front of the property requires that the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1711)|

| 0:29:43| this variance for the driveway that already existed and was only paid for the convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1783)|

| 0:30:11| Mr. Johnson, is Ms. Harmon on as far as you can tell? She is. She seems to unmute herself. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1811)|
| 0:30:26| Yeah, okay. Yeah, we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| Great. Thank you for calling in and you have up to five minutes. You can start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1832)|

| 0:31:01| since 1983 and have lived in it continuously since I retired in 2000. I've watched the rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1861)|
| 0:31:10| of the house on the corner there and have been so pleased watching the improvements that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| were making, and I was particularly impressed with the change in the driveway because it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1875)|
| 0:31:23| gravel and mud before that. When I saw the variance sign come up, I called you. I called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1883)|
| 0:31:35| the people and they didn't contact me. I wanted to know what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| June Street was established in the 50s and has a total of 14 homes, 12 of which are owner-occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| so it's not highly traveled. The boulevard entrance area at Sevierville Pike is well-defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1910)|
| 0:31:58| and I have never seen or heard of anyone having an accident there because they took the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1918)|

| 0:32:16| Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Harmon. That concludes the people who've signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1936)|
| 0:32:25| Is there a motion from a council member? I'll move to grant the approval. Motion made by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| Ms. Testerman to approve. I'll second. Seconded by Ms. Singh. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1951)|
| 0:32:41| Can we hear from someone from engineering on this request? Is it Peter Ahrens or engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1961)|
| 0:32:50| Well, or Mr. Ahrens. I thought it was engineering staff, but I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| Brian Berry maybe. Hi, this is Peter. The regulations come out of the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1974)|
| 0:33:03| and they're based on engineering principles to set driveways back from an intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| to 50 feet, and the concern is that if you've got driveways that are closer than 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| it's more inviting for people accessing the driveway to bypass the big loop or the loop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=1996)|
| 0:33:27| going down the boulevard and back, and so there was a concern that was expressed during the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| hearing that it might be more inviting for somebody to travel the wrong direction on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| boulevard road. So the standard that this is based upon, I know this has come up in multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2018)|
| 0:33:47| other places, the standard this is based upon is an engineering or it's an across-the-board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| standard. It's not just a Knoxville standard. Is that my understanding? Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| That would be my understanding. I might rely on Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| Mr. King, do you have anything to add to, you know, help us understand this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| Yes, this is Steve King in the engineering department. Can you speak a little louder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| It's hard to hear you. Okay, Steve King with the engineering department. That's good. I think in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| general, driveways that are located in close proximity to intersections are more of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2067)|
| 0:34:38| That's why there is the regulation about the 50 feet of separation from the intersecting streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| Obviously, that's the standard. That's what's in the zoning code. I think council has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| opportunity to evaluate this situation and make a decision, but from an engineering standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2094)|
| 0:35:03| in general, we prefer not to have driveways that close to intersections. However, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2103)|
| 0:35:12| you obviously can take into account the volume of traffic on the street, this being a dead-end street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| You know, it may be a situation of, you know, you could evaluate whether this is more risky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2119)|
| 0:35:28| than a situation where there's a greater average daily traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2128)|
| 0:35:36| Sorry, Councilwoman. I'll just one follow-up question, then I'll hand it over. Mr. Aarons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| did they submit plans where they, I mean, it looks like from our packet they didn't submit any plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| that the issue here is that their contractor who laid the driveway did not get a permit or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| submit any plans, and the parcel goes pretty deep down June, so they had a lot of other options for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| where to put a driveway on the back of the parcel. Can you clarify that for us? Sure. It's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| understanding that the paving took place without a permit. Obviously, we would have captured that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| during the permitting process. If you look back at the historical aerial views on KGIS, you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| at various times over the years that people did indeed use it for their vehicles. That doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| necessarily mean that it was a permitted, an approved permitted use at those various times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| So, the situation here is that the driveway was installed, we were notified, we followed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| and started bringing them through the process to legalize it, and then we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2202)|
| 0:36:51| Thank you, Mr. Ahrens. Ms. Ryder, do you have any other questions at this junction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| No, I'll let Mr. Smith have this. Okay, Mr. Smith. I have a question for the appellate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| Ms. Kennedy. May I ask why you didn't put the driveway more towards the rear of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| Can you hear me? Yes. Okay, yes. The property was divided. We do not own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2232)|
| 0:37:20| let me pull out the plat, from we only own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| only own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| that property only has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| 53 feet. Well, I can, can I show, can you all see this? No. Okay. Okay, it only has 53 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2254)|
| 0:37:48| where the back lot has 80 feet, so the, so the property was divided in half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| so there's very little room for a driveway anywhere else. The whole bottom section of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| property is a different lot with a different plat number. Okay, Mr. Smith, did you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2281)|
| 0:38:10| follow-up questions? Yeah, one more question. There, I noticed in the packet there were a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| number of situations along Sevierville Pike where driveways are less than 50 feet from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| intersection. I was going to ask Mr. King, I know you don't, maybe don't know the history of all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| those, but why are there so many examples where that is the case? Mr. King? Yes, Seed King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2310)|
| 0:38:39| Engineering, those may have been built years ago before these regulations were in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| or they could have been built in the county before this area was annexed into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| The situation that we have, you know, when a driveway is constructed or paved or improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| that's when the newer regulations would kick in. Thank you. Yeah, I'm very familiar with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| property, Ms. Kennedy, and you do have some topographic challenges in front of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| where, you know, there's drainage there, there's a big ditch that you couldn't necessarily easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| build a driveway directly onto Sevierville Pike, and given the boulevard, I think you're right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2357)|

| 0:39:33| possible. So I'm inclined to approve the appeal, but I'll pause for any other questions that any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| other council members might have. Thank you, Mr. Smith. Any other questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| Ms. Ryder? I just want to clarify, Ms. Kennedy, so you purchased the properties together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2389)|
| 0:39:57| to renovate the house, and they're currently for sale. Are you only selling the house and the lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| You're not selling them together? No, they are separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| The bottom lot has... You're keeping the back lot. That's not the current listing. No, the back lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| has already been sold. The back lot has a contract that we are picking up tomorrow. It has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2418)|
| 0:40:27| sold. Okay, so they are separate, and that's why you can't put the driveway back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| Yes, ma'am. Okay, the part that I'm struggling with is we're being asked to grant a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| retrospectively to correct not getting a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| May I speak toward the permit part? Sure. First of all, that is my fault, and I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| apologize for that. I never do anything without a permit. Every time I buy a home, I go through city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| codes. I am friends with the inspectors because I'm always bugging them, please do it on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2461)|
| 0:41:10| I need to make sure that everything I'm doing is right. It's very, very important to me that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| houses are in excellent condition, that they are up to date with all the codes. We remove all old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2475)|
| 0:41:24| wiring, which is not necessarily code, but we don't want anything in those homes that are old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| We put everything new. The house that we did previously had the same situation. It had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| driveway, and we paved it. In my bad, I had no idea you had to have a permit for a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2497)|
| 0:41:46| I know now, and I will never do it again. I just want to say you do end up, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2506)|
| 0:41:55| being the one held responsible for it, but what's really unfortunate is the contractors who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| do the driveways know this, and they should know better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Well, I'm so sorry, and it will never happen again. I just didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2523)|
| 0:42:13| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder. Any other questions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| Ms. Parker, were you signaling? Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| I have more of a statement than a question. It seems like a very reasonable situation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2541)|
| 0:42:30| the driveway should be grandfathered in, and it also doesn't seem like repaving a driveway would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| trigger updated zoning requirements to then apply to your driveway. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| many residents would anticipate that, so I'm definitely going to vote in favor of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2563)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Parker. Any other questions or comments by Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2573)|

| 0:45:29| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2729)|

| 0:45:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| When I first saw this on the agenda, my reaction was that this is the wrong time to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| something like this, but this is just amending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| It's already been in motion since last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| And the other thing I really support about it is I think it's a pathway that can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| for helping people get to where they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| It's a long Broadway, and I wish a lot more of the greenways were set up that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| that it was also a transportation route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| So, yeah, I'm in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2772)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Thank you, Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Mr. Thomas, and then Ms. Parker after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Yes, this project will connect the Fulton High School greenway with the First Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| greenway, and it's designed to make the area in front of the Broadway Shopping Center much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| safer for pedestrians and bicyclists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| And it's been an area that's been prone to accidents and quite dangerous for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2792)|
| 0:46:40| It came about between a collaboration between the city and the Broadway Corridor Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| Councilperson Ryder and myself were both members of that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| In fact, Councilperson Ryder chaired it for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| As far as the funding goes, it's a grant from the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| that's going to cover 80% of the cost, and the city will give a 20% matching grant for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| those who are concerned about funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Thank you, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| It says the city's MAC is budgeted in the capital improvements budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| Is that under the current fiscal year or the proposed capital improvements budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2841)|
| 0:47:29| I will ask Mr. Brace to answer or Steve King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| Someone, I think, is this current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| Boyce Evans here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Boyce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Thank you, Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| From finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| That's budgeted in this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I wanted to tack on to what Councilman Thomas said and Councilwoman Singh said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| This is one of the top three busiest bus stops in the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| So, incredible amount of foot traffic, and there's a lot of students that leave Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| And this particular component of the Greenway addresses a piece that might work out to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| with some traffic issues where we've had accidents, including pedestrians that have been hit by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2896)|
| 0:48:24| cars there at Cecil and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| So, there's a lot of things coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| It's certainly not all ironed out and it's been a way longer road than one would anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| to try and make this all gel and one day before I die come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| Not to sound pessimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Councilman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Just another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| There's a lot of excitement about this Greenway improvement from folks that I talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| And a lot of folks who are asking for it to be extended further once the Hall of Fame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2935)|
| 0:49:03| Broadway intersection moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Are there talks taking place of continuing this Greenway to like the Sixth Avenue area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2946)|
| 0:49:16| where it can connect up with another Greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| Councilman Parker, do you, I mean, Thomas, do you want to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| Thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=2964)|

| 1:02:20| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets for fiscal year 2019-2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| Okay, there's someone who signed up to speak to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| Ms. Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Barbara Cook, is she on the call, on the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| I believe she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Ms. Cook, if you could unmute yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| We're on item 12A, and you've signed up to speak in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| So, please start by saying, stating your name and address for the record, and you'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| Okay, my name is Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| I live at 4221 Chinquapin Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| I had sent an email to you, your honor, and to all of the council people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3791)|
| 1:03:19| and I say good evening to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| Your honor, distinguished council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| I really would just like to read this email into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| First, may I say I appreciate the difficult times we are in and the challenges it presents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| I realize time is valuable, so in my attempt to make this brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| I hope you will not discount the earnestness of my urging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| I read recently that consideration is being given to distribute funds to multiple agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| to provide recognition and relief during this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| I applaud the designation of $500,000 to the United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| Hopefully, this will get to organizations with boots on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| I trust specific direction as to how it should be used will accompany those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| Let's try staying away from these guidelines that are so often construed as, if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| I take extreme exception, however, to the disparity between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| and the choice made to consider $124,000 to Second Harvest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| and only $62,000, half that amount, to CAC, presumably Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3870)|
| 1:04:38| I ask you to consider that Second Harvest, as part of the larger Feeding America group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| has many, many sources of revenue and donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| It hasn't been that long since Lady Gaga, Ellen DeGeneres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| and Elton John teamed up in concert for Feeding America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3890)|
| 1:04:55| In addition, just recently, Kroger awarded Second Harvest $15,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| and made them a part of their Roundup campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| I'm sure they can always use more, but perhaps not just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| I urge you to contact Mobile Meals and inquire as to the additional measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| and delivery areas they have had to assume recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| They are delivering to folks that are not within their usual scope in order to fill in gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| for folks who can't make it out to food banks and other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| Talk about boots on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| I realize everyone has had to adjust, but I submit Second Harvest Feeding America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| has not adjusted or will not be impacted twice as much as Mobile Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| Please reconsider that disparate distribution proportion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| Finally, about the bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| Though it is certainly important to recognize those who are on the front lines of contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| with potential carriers of the virus, perhaps waiting a bit might be more prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| Money and resources are going to be strained, and it will certainly benefit everyone in the long haul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| if we don't distribute it now because we have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| We are potentially likely to have much greater need down this long road we are surely likely to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| We may find that those who have jobs, regardless of how risky they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| are far better off than the many who are likely to suffer from no job at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| and little likelihood of getting back to work soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| Thank you for your time, your consideration, and your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| Thank you for your time, your consideration, and your service to the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| Y'all stay safe and stay well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Thank you, Ms. Cook, for your email and for taking the time to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| Council members, I believe you're all pretty familiar with this, but just a quick overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| In addition to the monies you've already approved in our response to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| which $100,000 to CAC, $95,000 to VMC, the Guest House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| another $116,000 for EOC purchases, and the emergency funding for the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4034)|
| 1:07:21| This is an additional million dollars, a little over a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| $417,000 of that is a $500 one-time payment for uniformed police and fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4044)|
| 1:07:32| who I would love to be able to give that kind of bonus to all our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| but we are in tight budget times, and I designated it towards them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| because of the particular challenges they face and the difficulties they face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| and they obviously can't not respond to emergencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| even if someone is known as an infected person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| So they're on the front lines of dealing with this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| and they're also exempt from the city's policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| where you're allowed to take more generous leave and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| So because of that, I think they are in special consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| It's not any slight to the rest of our employees who are also working incredibly hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| It also is $200,000 in grants to basic food needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| including Nourish Knoxville, Mobile Meals, Second Harvest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| and that's in addition to other sources of funding that already go to those organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| And I also just wanted to mention that the $500,000 I'm proposing to go to United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| is being made by private donations in the same amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| and they are actively distributing funds to numerous local non-profits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| and if this is approved, we would encourage non-profits interested in applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| to contact and go through United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| So that's just a little overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| I'm happy to let you guys have your questions and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| Ms. Fugett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| Sorry, took my hand off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| The $500,000 to United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| talked about that being matched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| Is that a separate match from the fundraising campaign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| I saw Matt was on the call at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| Is that an additional $500,000 above what they're already soliciting from the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4166)|
| 1:09:37| Matt Ryerson, the head of the United Way is on the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| so I'm going to let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| And then I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| So let me go ahead and ask that as well, Matt, and you can answer it all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4184)|
| 1:09:49| And then are the grant applications what you're currently doing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| or is this a different phase of fundraising and grant requests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| Mr. Ryerson, if you could unmute yourself and just state your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| Yeah, this is Matt Ryerson, President and CEO of the United Way of Greater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| That match is the $500,000, which is actually our current total commit is $516,032,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4216)|
| 1:10:24| is a part of that fundraising campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| So that's not a separate dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| That's the effort that we've been putting in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| And then you kind of broke up, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| I didn't catch that second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| My second question is, so I assume that this is the same grant process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| that you're already using with nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| You'll just have additional funds to perhaps fund some grant requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| from additional nonprofits or ones who were unable to get earlier funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4261)|
| 1:11:01| Yes, ma'am, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| And then just for the record, so everybody is clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| none of this money is going to United Way Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| It is all going direct to agency grants, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| We launched this as a partnership with the Alliance for Better Nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| and the East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| And our agreement was 100% would go directly to nonprofit organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| directly serving families impacted by COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4290)|
| 1:11:30| I had had questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| I knew that was the answer, but I wanted you to be able to say that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you, Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| Mr. Ryerson, since we have you on the line, can you talk to us as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| about the ways that the United Way will be accountable to this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| given the distribution of these funds, like you said, directly to people in need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| We have a pretty broad partnership with a range of nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| and there is a reporting mechanism that is a requirement for receiving these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| So we're compiling as we fund an ongoing report to those that are being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| Additionally, we always love, and it's actually a foundational issue of the United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| and one of the things I'm most proud of is that donors do and should have a say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| in what their dollars go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| And so we look at this partnership as a great opportunity to meet the needs of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| of the City of Knoxville and have that voice of the City of Knoxville in on that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| Will only traditionally funded groups with the United Way have access to these grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| or will you be expanding that out in a way that maybe previously unaffiliated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| groups could apply for the funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| Yeah, thanks for that question, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| No, this is really a separate fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| We view this as a community fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| It was intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| The alliance with the ABN and East Tennessee Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| was an effort to really create a community-driven fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| and we feel like really all nonprofits should and can be eligible for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| and that's been the policy from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| And so we have funded to this point, I'm pulling up my number now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| a little more than $200,000, $207,500 in grants and a range of nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| about 31 different programs, nearly half of which are not traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| United Way-funded organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| They're independent outside of our traditional cycle of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| As you talk about agencies that are providing services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| highest and best use for the COVID-19 impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| just curious, you also have some agency partners that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| also being funded individually outside of the United Way allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| So just trying to better understand and sort of how that may be working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4461)|
| 1:14:34| those agencies also part of your network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Yeah, so, and I'm trying to feel through your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| so if I don't answer it directly, feel free to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| You know, one of our goals in the partnership with the Alliance for Better Nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| and East Tennessee Foundation was try to be the best stewards of our limited resources as we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| which meant having conversations about who is funding what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| making sure that the program is doing good work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| we're receiving funding, and trying to match those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| And trying to match those dollars as far as they could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| because there are so many good organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| But as far as some of the programs that we do traditionally fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| and I'll give you a tangible example, that Boys and Girls Club is an after school program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| One of the challenges they had, and they did come to this fund for additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| outside the traditional avenue of United Way funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| One of the challenges they had was they were a traditional after school program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| servicing from somewhere around three to six o'clock in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| And when schools closed, rather than them stepping back and closing their doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4539)|
| 1:15:46| they stepped forward to serve essential service workers and expanded their hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| So they were working from six in the morning until six o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| The ratios were much lower because of the standards, so they had the staff up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| And those were all unbudgeted expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| And so when we sat down with them and talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| they were really able to point out how their framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| as far as budgeting, had really changed significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| And that supplemental funding was really necessary to keep them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| able to serve those on the front lines that needed that child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| Councilwoman, I'm not sure that answered your question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| I wanted to make sure it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Let me clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| I probably didn't clarify well enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| The city is funding some of your partner agencies over and above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| outside of the United Way Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4596)|
| 1:16:36| So then those agencies, I guess I'm just asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| will they then be able to apply for part of this fund or the matching fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| knowing that they've already been received funds directly from the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4606)|
| 1:16:52| Yeah, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| And so maybe an example of that would be CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| We've been able to have conversations with leadership and a lot of those nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| We try and really pay attention to where those funding sources are coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| and what balance they have and trying to track and make sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| A, their needs are being met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| and B, that we're not accidentally pouring too much money into one organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| because you don't want to cut short another organization that has equal needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| And so I do want to say that our nonprofit partners have been really forthcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4644)|
| 1:17:32| with what their needs are, when they feel like their needs are met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| when they feel like they've received enough funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| And to be honest with you, that doesn't happen very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| but we are seeing a real spirit of collaboration in that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| because there are a number of sources, not just in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| but when you start including HUD funding and some of the state funding that's available out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| USDA funding, there's a lot of potential funding sources that have been made available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| So we're really trying, in collaboration with our partners out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| to make sure that we're not duplicating funding, we're not overfunding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| but simultaneously, as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| making sure that we're meeting the needs of those that are on the front lines really serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| Does that address your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| Yes, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Yeah, I know many people on your team, Mayor Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| have been working with different groups around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| I was wondering if I could call on Erin Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| I think she's been working on that, to address some of the food security funding here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| like how often are you talking to them, what's the process been like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4729)|
| 1:18:56| how did these asks come about, the amounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| what is going on, and what are they doing, and how are they challenged right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| and are their needs met, and what are the needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder, Erin Gill, Chief Policy Officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| As you alluded to, there are several city staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| who are actively engaged on a fairly daily basis with many non-profits across the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| I believe it's five, Matt, right, five working groups that are mobilized through the EOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| In particular with food, the Council may be aware that there is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| a long-standing Food Policy Council in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| it's one of the first food policy councils ever created in the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| and Fiona McAnally, who is on my team over at the city, and many of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| she is the staff support for that Food Policy Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| and their mission, as much as it is also related to issues like urban agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| in recent years, really originated out of this concept of food security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| and so as we were mobilizing through the Emergency Operations Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| with regard to food security, the Food Policy Council is really ideally situated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| it includes not only Fiona as staff support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| but many of the partners who are actively engaged in the food system network in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| Fiona is in daily communication with that food security group that is mobilizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| not only through the CAC for seniors, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| Second Harvest for general population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| they are involved with the groups that are serving youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| and in coordination with the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| there's a representative from the Knox County feeding program on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| so that committee has existed already, and it really ramped up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| and was able to respond very quickly, and very coordinated to this crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| so in making the request that you see in front of you for the budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| that was really a pulse on what the needs of the agencies that were mobilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| through that emergency operations effort in regards to food security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| what gaps still existed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| knowing that many of them were able to rely on some of these new funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| such as the Feeding America grant program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| and so really making sure that we are meeting basic needs first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| and food access is chief among those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| really making sure that the city was in a position to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| if we saw a gap, be able to fill that gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| so in talking with those groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| that is how we arrived at the numbers that you see in front of you for the 200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| for this fiscal year in the budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| so the four groups there being four partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| and that is the amount that they requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| to just fill that gap that they see in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| So Mobile Meals has really expanded what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| but this is the ask they had to meet that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| That's right, that's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| and Barbara Kelly and Kathy Price from Second Harvest are both on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| and I want to give them a shout out, excuse me, Kathy Prince,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| because they're, as you know them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| these organizations, including the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Senior Citizen Home Assistance Service, Nourish Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| all of them have not only ramped up their existing infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| which is very robust, but also been really innovative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| in thinking about new delivery mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| that are specific to respond to the needs of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| so both Barbara and Kathy are on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| if you'd like to get more into the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| but yes, these funding recommendations are based on that request that they made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4935)|
| 1:22:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| Thank you, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| Yeah, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| For some of these service providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| particularly Second Harvest Food Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| I've been getting reports from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| that some of their services have ceased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| like delivering meals to assisted living homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| Is this correct, what folks are telling me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| And because of that, I'm seeing grassroots groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| who are trying to fill in that gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| of getting the food delivery out to vulnerable populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| that are not being serviced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| This is not necessarily specifically the elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| but vulnerable populations throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| Is that an effort that the city sees as a priority to fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=4996)|
| 1:23:23| Or does the city feel like this funding will cover that need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| So, with regard to specific services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| I would have to defer to Kathy and Barbara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| who are on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| and obviously this is an ever-evolving situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| so I don't want to misspeak based on what I had heard a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| So, Ms. Kelly, are you available to maybe talk to the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| that Mobile Meals is still providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| and the delivery and your capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| to continue adding folks to your Mobile Meals delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| should there be a need from a senior citizen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| And then similarly, Kathy, if you could speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| to maybe the particular situation that Councilwoman Parker raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5043)|
| 1:24:10| Ms. Kelly, are you available right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5050)|
| 1:24:19| Ms. Prince, Kathy Prince,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| if you're available, we'll start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| She's here with Second Harvest, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| And if you could address Ms. Parker's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| and just share with us a little bit about any service issues you guys have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| Yes, some of our deliveries to some of the Towers housing projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5071)|
| 1:24:39| were not stopped by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| They were stopped at the request of the management of those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| Even after that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| we still delivered by hand a box to each door for a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| From that point forward, they did not want the folks in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| to congregate down in the common areas to come and get the food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| and they didn't really want us to bring it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| So, we stopped that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| Even though we're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| I'm really willing and able whenever they were able to take it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| I did work with Fiona McAnally and some members of the Food Policy Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| to kind of formulate a plan for delivery of boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| to anyone who might be in a lockdown situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| should there be a positive case of COVID on the floors of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| And some of those boxes indeed were delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| We now have a plan for delivery of those boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| Second Harvest works through our agencies for delivery of food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| We are essentially a food depository.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| We are actually the source of food for some of the food for mobile meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| So, we do need to work with community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| and realize that we have some work to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| and planning for the future should this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| Some of our agencies did close some of our food pantries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| Many of them are run by elderly folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| who have a higher risk of catching the disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| and having ill effects from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| So, once those agencies closed, other agencies picked up a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| We saw a very high spike in people served at the end of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| That is leveled off a little bit right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| but we expect that to come in waves during the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| We have about a half a million dollars or more of food on order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| to come into this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| That'll be provided to those agencies at no cost whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| So, what we're hoping to do with the Food Policy Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| is to develop more procedures for getting the food out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| if our agencies are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Should there be a shutdown situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| Thank you, Ms. Prince.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| Ms. Kelly, I see that you're unmuted now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| Do you have, could you tell us about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| mobile meals and service challenges that you're facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| or that are being met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| Maybe, are you on, Ms. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| I will say she had texted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| She's on a new iPad and was hoping it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| So, if she doesn't come through here in a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| she wanted me to send her her apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| Barbara, Ms. Kelly, are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| Well, one thing I think that, you know, Ms. Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| you raised a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| What can people do if they're using a mobile phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| Well, I think that's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| I think that's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| I think that's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| I think that's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| I think that's a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Ms. Parker, you raised a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| What can people do if they are seeing gaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| Should they contact, I mean, one thing is to call 2-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| and Ms. Prince or Erin can speak to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| what if there's a group that feels like they see a gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5285)|
| 1:28:09| How can they share that gap with people who have food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| or entities who are willing to sort of bridge that gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| and have the resources to do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| Aside from calling 2-1-1, should they call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| Second Harvest directly or call Mobile Meals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| What is the advice to the public that we can share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| So, Mayor, just to jump in there a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| I mean, I think you're absolutely right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| that 2-1-1 is one of the first points of contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| However, I will also give a shout out to United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| and the Volunteer Knoxville Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| that has also mobilized quite significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| to be able to be a clearinghouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| for some of those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| So, Volunteer Knoxville and United Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| Matt, you might be able to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| the kind of latest and greatest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| on how those processes are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| But the important thing to really remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| is that if you are a nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| who is providing direct services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| and needs access to food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| that there are resources in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| who can provide that food access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| in a much more cost-effective way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| than going down to Costco or Sam's Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| And so I think that is the type of system coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| that the Food Policy Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| and the Food Security Response Group of the EOC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| has really mobilized to try to help coordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| And so I'll leave it to Kathy or Matt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| to potentially chime in on those exact systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| But what we are very cognizant of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| is that as those groups mobilize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| that providing those resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| through these core institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| like Second Harvest and CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| allows a lot of that efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| and cost-effectiveness to translate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| through a much wider network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| of nonprofit service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| Ms. Parker, did you have any other things you wanted to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| I don't know if that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| That did answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| Just on the other part of the proposed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5400)|
| 1:30:07| you know, I received a lot of concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| about the bonus pay being only for police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| And those concerns have been joined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| with examples of calls to KPD that were not answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5422)|
| 1:30:29| So I just wanted to lift that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| because that was one reason given for the bonuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| is that they're not able to not respond now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| but I'm actually getting a lot of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| of KPD not responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| There was a complaint today from South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| for gunshots in a house next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| an hour after calling KPD, they haven't arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| We saw a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| and while some folks may have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| videos of different neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| where fights were breaking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| and going on for an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| in an area where I usually see a police presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| at least five blocks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| So it was just unbelievable to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| that within that hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| there was not a police cruiser that showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| So I wanted to lift up those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| you know, what folks had shared with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| and their concerns and lift up that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| you know, on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| we have, you know, public service workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| who come into contact with every housed person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| through picking up trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| and probably even folks who don't have a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| you know, at least twice a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| And I think that's quite incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| The trash is where we're throwing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| all of our potentially infected tissues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| and materials that we're keeping ourselves clean with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| And, you know, on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| I don't understand our funding for CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| and how we direct those dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| whether we just, we allocate a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| and then CAT decides what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| But a lot of folks are certainly bringing up our bus workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| you know, who are showing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| and keeping that essential service going despite the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| So I just wanted to lift up these other workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| who are, you know, also not able to not answer the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| but who are showing up every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| and putting themselves at considerable risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| Thank you, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| I totally agree with you that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| all our city workers are doing great work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| and have extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| I just think that our uniform personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| have, you know, especially extenuating circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| and the CAT system is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| They are a little independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| Ms. Gill or Ms. Roberson, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| you know, can explain that in greater detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| but I think they have their own way of paying people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| that is not directed direct by the mayor or council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| We find, you know, we supplement the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| and some of it's through federal grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| but they have a labor organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| and it's just a sort of a different side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| Do you want to expand on that, Ms. Gill or Ms. Roberson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| This is Erin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| I think Melissa may have jumped off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| after the CAT item, but that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| They are technically CAT is the drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| and the bus operators are not city employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| They are part of the amalgamated transit union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| and technically accounted by CATRANS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| So there is obviously a relationship there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| but it is a separate budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| Okay. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| Yes, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| I'm not sure who to direct this to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| It might be Mr. Bryce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| It might be Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Could be Boyce Evans as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| It's my understanding that all departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| have access to taking 96 hours of paid leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| And if it is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| are KPD and KFD exempt from those times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| that they can take off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| I mean, all of our employees are allowed to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| except police and fire are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| They don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| They're not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5692)|
| 1:34:52| We made them exempt because of their role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| David, if you want to expand upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| Yeah, that's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| This is David Bryce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| the COO and deputy to American Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| And yes, the FRCCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| the federal allowance for employees to take that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| a plus additional time at a reduced rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| We met with police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| They were exempt because of the nature of their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| and general government employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| had the ability to access that added benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| And they've also, in some instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| have had the ability to obviously work remotely from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| Over 300 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| our info systems department was able to get them home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| And then other situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Ms. Parker, you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Public service workers do collect garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| and we've been able to add PPE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| But you're right, there have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| there are employees that are working more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| you know, there are employees that are working very hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| but the exemption and the direct exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| for police and fire was a strong basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| Okay, Mr. Roberto, any other follow up questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| No, I mean, I think we've gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| a pretty good discussion of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| you know, I think there's a lot of need out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| I don't think anyone's debating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| There's a lot of people who are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| you know, our neighbors who are really struggling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| you know, in a lot of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| And then we have, you know, an opportunity as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| you know, to, you know, help out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| you know, members of, you know, the city team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| that aren't able to participate in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| you know, paid time off like everyone else can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| So, you know, I can understand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| certainly some discussion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| but I think this one needs to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| So I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| Thank you, motion made to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| by Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| seconded by Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| Ms. Singh, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| I was saying that I still had discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| unless Councilman Roberto was calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| No, please, more questions or discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| I also had trouble seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| what was going to the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| and the fire department as a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| And in speaking with people that 96 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| and what the rest of the city employees are getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| that they are not, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| makes it not as much of a bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| but to try to make them a little bit closer to whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| with what everybody else is getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| I also wanted to comment on a couple days ago on Facebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| I guess it was in the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| There was this huge tank looking like thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| and the optics of that at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| you know, a lot of the comments were thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| that it was bought brand new and by city monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| So I just wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| I talked to Erin Gill about that earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| if she wouldn't mind commenting on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| Uh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| Well, and I would very much want to defer to Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| who knows the ins and outs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| but the particular points of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| and I always forget the general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| general something vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| It's got a funny acronym,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| general purpose vehicle, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| So it has actually been part of the city's fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| for well over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| So it is in no way a new vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| that was purchased recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| certainly not one that we spent money on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| during this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| And similar to the Big Honk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| it's I think most used purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| to either be in parades or to protect events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| So Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| maybe you can answer kind of some of the specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| but especially in light of some of the special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5943)|
| 1:39:10| I think we might finally have Ms. Kelly on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| But anyway, it is a barricade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| and used regularly to protect special event goers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| And I'll defer to Chief Thomas for more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| Chief Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| Is Chief Thomas on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| I couldn't get myself unmuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| Yes, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| This vehicle was purchased in 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| following 9-11 with some homeland security funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| granting grant funds that were given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| It's a regional vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| It's able to be used anywhere in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| It is simply maintained now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| It's totally paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| The maintenance averages a little over $1,200 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| and average maintenance on a police car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| is about $1,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| So you can kind of gauge what we spend on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| But it is used as a rescue vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| And as Ms. Gill said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| as Deputy Mayor Gill said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| it is used to protect people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| mainly at protests or First Amendment gatherings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| to protect people who are there to assert their rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| or counter protesters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| So that's about how it's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| Yeah, we've decided after this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| that it will no longer be used in parades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| or public gatherings for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6036)|
| 1:40:36| Councilwoman Singh, just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| thanks for raising those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| and giving Chief Thomas an opportunity to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| I realize that in hindsight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| the optics were suboptimal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| and that sends a message that I don't want to send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Our police are there to keep the peace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| and to be guardians of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| We're not the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| And that vehicle sends a different message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| And I think that's not the message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| I want to go to the community or to potential recruits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| who I want to join the police force as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| you know, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| keepers of the peace and community-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| and people who reflect our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| and are trusted by our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| And, you know, that vehicle may have a role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| very limited role in terms of, you know, protecting people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| but it's not going to be in parades anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| And just for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| I also rode in, you know, a fire truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| It was an event to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| sort of celebrate and honor the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| So anyhow, thanks for posing those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| And thank you, Chief Thomas, for the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| So essentially it's a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| or something that is offensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| not defensive or the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| Chief Thomas describes it as a defensive vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| If there's an acute situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| police can be inside that and, you know, be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| I, someone told me that a vehicle like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| was used at the Orlando tragedy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| at the Pulse nightclub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| when they wanted to break down a wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| and let people get out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| but it's not a type of vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| that you use every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| You know, it's something that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| hopefully very rarely used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| and it's not something that we need to showcase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| in a parade-like setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| I don't think it's helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| for community relationships at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| Can I add something quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| I just would, I would really like us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| to have some guidelines in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| of when that vehicle is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| I first saw that vehicle in 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| when I was on my way to a protest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| with high schoolers and flip-flops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| That vehicle scared the mess out of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| I felt like I was under attack by my own city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| I did not know if that vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| was going to open up and start shooting folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| These are the thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| that were going through my head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| when I saw that vehicle on my streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| because of a protest of 15 high schoolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| It wasn't even that many high schoolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| 15 people total on Magnolia Street Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| So I just wanted to emphasize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| that I don't think it's enough to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| we don't use it in parades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| I would like for us to not use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| against our own citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| for intimidation purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| for whatever purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| If there's an active shooter situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| and police need to take cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| that makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| If 15 teenagers are gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| on the corner of Magnolia and Cherry Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| we don't need that vehicle out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| Thank you, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| I'll ask Chief Thomas to share with council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| what the parameters are that she has for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| and we can just review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| So Chief Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| if you could just get back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| We can talk about when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| but sometime maybe between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| and the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| Of course, I'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| Ms. Kelly from CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| has been able to unmute herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| So she wanted to clarify a particular thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| that was in the food security discussion before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| Ms. Kelly, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| Hopefully I'm here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| Yeah, your voice is unmistakable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| After being here for 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| my New York accent prevails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| With regard to mobile meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| I just did want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| that we didn't leave anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| with a misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| During this period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| we have in the mobile meals kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| prepared over 84,000 meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| and we have delivered 37,831 mobile meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| and about 6,000 congregate meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| During this period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| we have also added about 150 mobile meals recipients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| to our group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| bringing the total to around 1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| Well, that 150 that we've added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| that's going to be increased costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| which really were not reflected at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| we gave kind of a short-term estimate on our need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| So we at CAC fundraise for mobile meals all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| And so this is going to be an ongoing effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| to fund these meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| We will be requesting funding from the United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| We will be requesting funding from the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| We will be using our federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| and it's an ongoing effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| So there is not like kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| it would be great if we had a way to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| this is the budget for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| and it is totally funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| and we really don't have to be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| about fundraising going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| But I didn't want anyone to have a misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| that the money that's being provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| through the request that was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| it's being considered this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| is really very, very important to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| but it is not the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| And you will continue to see fundraising efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| on behalf of mobile meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| And on behalf of other activities that we provide at CAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| because it takes both our federal funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| our funding from our local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| and our private funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| to really cover all of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| that CAC does in the many areas that we work in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| Thank you, Ms. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| Any other questions on item 12A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| I'm really glad that the discussion came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| about the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| I think that was a really good discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| and having some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| I think maybe at a later date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| having Chief Thomas talk to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| about the parameters for which that might be deployed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| and certainly the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| that I think everyone has expressed tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| about that vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| and how it could be misinterpreted, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| But I also wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| going back on this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| we've got a very serious need out there in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| and I think we've had a really good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| I know the motion's been made, it's been seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| but this may be something that we want to act on quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| and so I'd make a move to move this on emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| so that we can go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| and get these funds out into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| Procedurally, that will require a vote of yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| from all council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| So if everyone's in agreement with moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| I'd be happy to bring that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| Council members, I mean, do you want to show of hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| whether you want to read it on emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| or we can go through the motions in a roll call and see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| I mean, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| We would have to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| Yeah, a substitute motion or an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| No, it would be amending to make an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| The vote would have to be six, not unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| Okay, so there's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| Councilman Roberto is proposing an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| to make this vote on emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| Is there a second to his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| Seconded by Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| Any discussion on this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6556)|
| 1:49:18| to make this on an emergency basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| Yes, since it's the issue is whether it's on emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| Just for clarification, is there any more discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| that we feel like we need on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| Anybody have anything else to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| Well, I'm not in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| So I'm not going to be voting in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| I'm not in support of how the funding is allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| and to whom, but otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| Okay, any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6597)|
| 1:50:06| Okay, seeing none, we're voting on the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| to hear this on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| Will you do a roll call vote, please, Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6614)|

| 1:50:58| on an emergency basis passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6658)|

| 1:51:15| since it's an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6675)|

| 1:51:56| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| 12B is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| for the several departments, agencies, and funds of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6723)|
| 1:52:07| for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2020 and ending June 30, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6727)|
| 1:52:15| Mayor, before we go into the motions and approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| I'd like to ask Mr. Frost if he could maybe give some context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| to item BNC 12 BNC for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| I emailed this out to Council last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| but I also understand it didn't go out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| And this gives a little background for the procedure tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| and the procedure coming up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| In the charter, section 901, section F, as in Foxtrot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6767)|
| 1:52:54| says after the conclusion, no, excuse me, E as in echo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| the Council shall pass the budget ordinance on the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| and thereafter the Council shall hold public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| on the proposed operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| as well as on the capital improvement budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| So tonight, the charter requires Council to pass the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6792)|
| 1:53:19| Then next Thursday and Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| we'll have a little more than a day and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| of the City Council budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| And that's when everyone is able to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| of the respective department heads and really get down in the weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| You know, I'm guessing not all department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| are at the Council meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| So you might have a question that someone's not here to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| but they will definitely be there either Thursday or Friday of next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| according to the schedule that Mr. Johnson has put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6832)|
| 1:53:59| Okay, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| Vice Mayor McKenzie, did you have any, did you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| I'll go ahead and make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| Motion made to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| So seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| Seconded by Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| I have a question for Mr. Frost, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| Are you still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| I'm still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Okay, so if it is necessary, mandatory for us to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| why do we need to have a vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| Well, it's being heard on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6878)|
| 1:54:43| I mean, this first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| Yeah, this first reading, that's just what the charter prescribes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| that it shall be passed on a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| And then the discussion occurs at the City Council budget workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6895)|
| 1:55:01| or budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| It just seems that there's not really a point in asking us for our vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| if it's mandatory that it pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| Just noticing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6912)|

| 1:55:20| I need to disclose that my wife works at the MUSE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| And she's worked there for about 10 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| The funding that is in the budget for the MUSE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| does not affect her employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| And she was not involved in the request for these funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| which are the same as the amount allotted for them the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| Therefore, I intend to vote on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| Okay, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| There's a note in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| Yes, we'll wait an hour to get it taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| A note in our packet that we have $60 million in capital funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6952)|
| 1:55:59| that will be allocated in the upcoming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| but it's not included in this budget because it's already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| Is there any way for especially new council members to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| get a list of what those projects are that the $65 million include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6973)|
| 1:56:21| Mr. Evans, our acting finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6981)|
| 1:56:29| What I think you're referring to, ma'am, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| funds that have been appropriated in the past, I would presume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=6994)|
| 1:56:42| in capital dollars because capital dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| they don't lapse like the operating dollars do at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| So there very well could be, you know, that amount going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| for things that have already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| Assuming that's what we're talking about, absolutely, we can get the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7020)|

| 2:02:06| Okay, motion made to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie, seconded by Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| I'll just explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| Yeah, I'll explain a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| We had a moratorium and then the NPC or the PC had some recommendations for some revisions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7338)|
| 2:02:28| the guidelines we use for applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| And those came to me shortly before the pandemic started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7351)|
| 2:02:35| And so we just haven't had time to have some discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| And I think there need to be revisions of this committee and standards that we use for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| applications to it that I would like to discuss with different members of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| So I need a little more time to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7371)|
| 2:02:55| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| Seeing none, does someone have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| I found it concerning to find this agenda item on today's agenda because it's time for me to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7384)|
| 2:03:18| my appointment to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7398)|
| 2:03:22| And this is delaying my ability to make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| And I believe my appointment would affect our chair's ability to stay on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7406)|
| 2:03:33| I'm actually term limited, so you don't have to kick me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| I'm term limited by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| And so things need to happen quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| And what needs to happen is I need to have a discussion with the recommendations from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| Planning Commission based on recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| They basically did a review of what other cities were looking at for applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7436)|
| 2:04:04| We had a confusing set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| We had a very confusing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| Before you were on council, the ordinance asked for renamings of existing roads to come to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7449)|
| 2:04:18| Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| And those weren't being sent to the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| They were being advertised as coming to council and skipping the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| So I was trying to iron out with the Planning Commission to basically alleviate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7469)|
| 2:04:36| We had a lot of public members that were coming down anticipating their agenda item to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| And unfortunately, we were having to delay those items and ask members of the public to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7483)|
| 2:04:47| multiple meetings that were delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| And so this item was initially on a moratorium in the fall, in October or November, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7489)|
| 2:05:01| And the recommendations were not given to me from the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7501)|
| 2:05:07| until early March, March 2nd or March 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| And due to various schedules, I just have not been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7511)|
| 2:05:20| make the changes and look at the recommended changes and get them ironed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| So I am in no way, I'm not able to hold the seat past, I believe, June 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7524)|
| 2:05:31| And I don't believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7531)|
| 2:05:37| I mean, we don't have to have it to be 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| I think we really need to look at how this committee works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7539)|
| 2:05:46| To be blunt with you, what happens right now is we get applications for honorary renamings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| and members of the public that are on the committee take time out of their schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| they leave work early, they come down, and the meetings last five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7555)|
| 2:06:02| So it's really not an effective use of people's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| I don't mind coming down and finding a parking space to be there for five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| but I think that's not a kind use of people's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| And so what we were trying to do is not waste people's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| People who are coming to council meeting and their agenda item wasn't being heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| people who come to PP&C meeting and they're there for five minutes and then they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| It took them longer to park than the meeting actually took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| So I think in discussion, the 90 days was proposed and the off chance that it took 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7592)|
| 2:06:46| But I'm happier to wrap it up sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7606)|
| 2:06:51| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| Seeing none, Mr. Johnson, would you conduct a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7622)|

| 2:07:33| 12G is an ordinance to amend several articles of the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7653)|
| 2:07:39| to correct drafting errors and provide for additional clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7659)|

| 2:07:50| Motion made to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie, seconded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7670)|
| 2:07:56| Mr. Roberto, are you seconding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| I've got a statement, maybe question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| Who's going to second this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7685)|
| 2:08:09| I may have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| Are we on agenda item E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7695)|
| 2:08:16| G is in Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| Oh, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| So the motion has been made to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7708)|
| 2:08:28| Nobody seconded it, so okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| Councilman Smith seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| Mr. Roberto, you wanted to comment and or make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| I think this one probably should have been included in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| needs more time for some community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| I think that the lighting issues have been, you know, pretty well answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7726)|
| 2:08:53| I had some questions for Mr. or Director Aarons today on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| But some of the items, including drainage easements and constructing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7738)|
| 2:09:06| you know, objects in those easements is still a little bit of a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| I did get, you know, some kind of last minute comments on potential changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| but I haven't had a chance to really consider those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| I do think this one's an important one for some more community engagement on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7760)|
| 2:09:26| And so my substitute motion would be to postpone it for two weeks like we did the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7766)|
| 2:09:34| I'd like to second that substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| Okay, motion is made to postpone it for two weeks by Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| seconded by Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| Any discussion on the substitute motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| Yes, I would be in favor of postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| It seems like we ought to do it together with the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| route to matters that were already postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| So let's just postpone it and hear them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7801)|
| 2:10:10| Okay, any other discussion on the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7810)|
| 2:10:16| Which I'm told is a priority motion, not a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7816)|
| 2:10:24| I'm not sure what that means, but maybe I'm finding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7824)|
| 2:10:28| I'm waiting to get a response, but I think we can still move forward with the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| Okay, then let's go ahead and vote on the priority motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7835)|
| 2:10:40| to postpone for two weeks on item 12 G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=7840)|

| 2:14:24| this one is to, it specifies that is to add full summer pool as a definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8064)|

| 2:19:36| Yes, I just wanted to, before anybody ran to make a motion, I wanted to say that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| like to make a motion to pass this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| This is items L, M, and N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| If my colleagues remember, this was on agenda about six weeks ago, and this is where we made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8388)|
| 2:19:55| some amendments, sent it back to MPC, so the parties came to an agreement over the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| It went back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8401)|

| 2:20:08| but all parties seemed to be amicable, and everything went through on consent at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8408)|
| 2:20:14| So since this has been very publicly vetted over multitudes of meetings, I think passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8414)|
| 2:20:20| it on emergency is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| Okay, motion made to hear item 12L on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| We need a, I'm sorry, we need a main motion first, and then we'll go to amend it after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8430)|

| 2:20:48| Then I'll make the motion to do it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8452)|

| 2:21:04| Seeing none, please conduct a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| Well, I had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| Since Councilperson Ryder was talking about three items, is it possible to do them all at once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8469)|
| 2:21:18| It's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| Mr. Frost, is that reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| I think you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| Be expedient, and they're all closely related to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8486)|
| 2:21:31| You need to consider them as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| You can't pass them on emergency than the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8494)|
| 2:21:41| Differently, it'd cause a little issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8501)|
| 2:21:45| Do we amend the original motion, or do we make another vote to vote on these as a group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8505)|
| 2:21:55| I think you should move to consider them and vote on them as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8515)|
| 2:22:03| Okay, I will make a motion to vote on them as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| And I will second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| Then I will make the motion that we do it all as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8527)|
| 2:22:12| Okay, I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| The motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| As further clarification, this was originally heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| Okay, well now that the lawyer's quiet, let's just vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8539)|
| 2:22:35| I believe what he was trying to say is this was originally heard publicly January 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8555)|
| 2:22:41| So, it's been many months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| I believe he's back with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| Mr. Frost, did you want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8570)|
| 2:22:50| I don't know what happened to my connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| But yes, this was originally considered MPC on January 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8572)|
| 2:22:56| So, it's actually been around even a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| Okay, so City Council lawyer says we can lump these three together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8584)|
| 2:23:10| And the motion on the floor is to consider them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| It's been the motion was made by Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| seconded by Councilwoman Fugate, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| Any questions about this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| Once we vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| then we'll come back to consider all three as an emergency, the lumped in ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| Okay, roll call vote on lumping them, all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8607)|
| 2:23:32| I think that, is that how to do it, Rob or Will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| I think lumping is a very formal word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200505?start=8621)|
