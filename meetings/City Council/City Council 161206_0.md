| 0:03:44| For the Mayor's report, first I want to just say a few words about the terrible fire last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=224)|
| 0:03:52| in Weir County and the Great Smoky Mountains. Thank you, Councilman Campin, for praying about that during our invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| I know that all of us have really shared in the horror at the videos and images that we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| of the devastation in Gatlinburg and the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| Our hearts and prayers go out to all those who lost loved ones and all those who've lost their belongings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=250)|
| 0:04:18| and to all the communities suffering there and to all the folks who reached their hearts out towards them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| We know that the damage touched so many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| We actually have two city employees who lost their homes in the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Thankfully, they and their families escaped safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| We had a person in the police department, a person in civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| Many of the co-workers, many of our co-workers have reached out to provide them with assistance and comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| And that's the same thing that we saw all across East Tennessee in this past week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| a huge outpouring of compassion, concern, and generosity from so many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| opening their hearts and their homes and making donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| The fires were a disaster and a tragedy, but the response to them really shows the deep sense of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| that we have here in East Tennessee, the volunteer spirit at its very best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| And that was really exemplified by our own emergency responders from the Knoxville Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| and the police department and from our emergency management agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| All of them had contingents of, our two departments had contingents of officers and equipment in Gatlinburg for most of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=321)|
| 0:05:29| And I'm going to ask Chief Sharp and Deputy Chief Holliday to talk about the fire department response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| and the police department response, and then Colin Ickes is going to talk to us about KEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| Our command center was there, still is there, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| So, Chief Sharp, do you want to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| First of all, I'd like to say that we were very happy and honored that we were able to help out our neighbors in Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=348)|
| 0:05:55| and especially their fellow firefighters in the Gatlinburg Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| We were first asked to help early Monday afternoon when we received a mutual aid request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| to send a fire engine strike team to Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| So we ended up joining with the rural metro fire department and Carnes Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| Each of us sent one fire engine with firefighters on board to assist Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=377)|
| 0:06:26| It didn't take long and we had additional requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| Without going into all the details, by the end of the day we had six fire trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| 30 firefighters, and three support vehicles in Gatlinburg fighting the fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=395)|
| 0:06:43| Before the end of the week, we actually helped out every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=403)|
| 0:06:52| Monday and Tuesday were primarily firefighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| but throughout the week we had people up there supporting other operations also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| We had several people in the command staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| We had people doing search and rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| We also had our chaplain up there coordinating chaplain services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| and we had a couple of our fire investigators helping with the fire investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| We wrapped up air support this last Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| In total, we had over 100 of our firefighters ended up going up there to help out throughout the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| We put in approximately 1,500 man hours to help them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Mayor, I want to echo what Chief Sharp said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| It was our honor to be able to go to Gatlinburg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| and help our brothers and sisters in that community out in a time they really needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| We got called on Tuesday morning about 4 a.m. asking for our assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| and sent a contingent of officers up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| From that Tuesday until this Saturday, we had 12 officers on site, 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| We manned traffic positions for Gatlinburg Police Department, did the road closures for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=483)|
| 0:08:11| We had some folks in the command center to help them out with some logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| We sent a group of our chaplains up to help first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| and our search and rescue team spent some time up there, too, helping in the search efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| It was an honor to be able to help those folks in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Colin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| I'm Colin Ickes, an officer with Knox County Emergency Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| We were called originally about 7 p.m. last Monday from Sevier County Emergency Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| to assist them with some of the communications issues that they were having during the incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| It was a terrible, terrible tragedy, almost unimaginable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| but it felt great to be able to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Monday evening, we responded with our mobile command post truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| as well as some of our communications equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| Frankly, we arrived just in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| They had to evacuate their first command post set up at a fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| It was close to being overrun by fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| and where they set up at their backup location had just lost power due to the fire burning through power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| So that happened shortly before we arrived with our mobile command post truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| which was very helpful to them in establishing communications and command and control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| We also deployed some of our communications equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| some of our transportable repeater equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| helped with some of the interoperability between all the different departments that were there responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| So it was an awful tragedy, but it felt really good to be able to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| I do want to pass along to you all that Friday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| Fire Chief Greg Miller of the City of Gatlinburg Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| during their evening briefing, he made it a point to single out the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| to thank for all the support and assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| There were many dozens of agencies there assisting and dozens in that briefing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| but frankly it was the city of Knoxville that he singled out to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| and in gratitude for all the support we were able to give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| Well, thank you all and all of your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=620)|
| 0:10:29| I talked to the governor yesterday morning and we were talking about Sevier County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| and he said that he knew that they were very grateful to all who had helped from all over the cities and counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| but they also mentioned us to him and he said that everywhere he turned when he was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| he ran into a police officer or a firefighter from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| So he felt very proud that we were there helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| So thank you all and please make sure all of our employees, our team members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| know how much we appreciate what they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| And we're still ready to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| If they need us again, we've offered, if they need public service trucks or engineers to help them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| or whatever we might need, they might need, we don't want them to hesitate to call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| But there's still more to do and of course there are a lot of folks who want to make contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| or figuring out a way to help, so we want to make sure that folks know that our 2-1-1 number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| you know, our 3-1-1 operators, our call line, those same operators plus a couple more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| actually have the 2-1-1 contract, you all will remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| So our operators serve both 2-1-1, which is more social services and help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| and 3-1-1 is the city, about city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| So 2-1-1 is the official number that folks in Sevierville are asking people to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| if they want to know how to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| And so our operators are there, we're going to extend our hours so that we're available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| to people who would be calling so we can get that information out to citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| residents who want to help the folks in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| And so we encourage people to call 2-1-1 if you want to know how you can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| The Sevier County Economic Development Council, in conjunction with Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| has created a new website to coordinate all of the relief and resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=743)|

| 0:12:41| Okay, so moving on to a happier seasonal note, we have more Great Christmas in the City events coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=761)|
| 0:12:50| This Friday, December 9th, we'll have our annual Christmas at Chilhowee from 6-9 p.m., sponsored by SMG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=770)|

| 0:13:01| After the ceremonial lighting of the Christmas tree, Santa will greet guests and pose for photos in the park's historic bandstand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=781)|

| 0:13:12| Families are invited to build gingerbread houses with the Austin East Culinary Arts Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| enjoy balloon animals and face painting, and participate in hands-on activities with the Muse Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| Visitors can also tour the 88 lighted trees by riding the train or hopping on a hayride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| and don't forget that you can do a self-guided tour of those lights any night from now through January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| So then the following Friday, December 16th, will be the Tour de Lights Bicycle Ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| The ride departs from Market Square at 7 p.m. that night, and the route runs a loop through downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| Forth and Gill, and Old North Knoxville neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Riders are encouraged to get creative with lights, costumes, and decorations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| and costume prizes will be awarded in many categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| The route is about five miles long and takes about an hour to ride at a casual pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| And you can get more information about these and any other events at our city website at knoxvilletn.gov slash Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| And speaking of bicycles, there will be a public meeting this Thursday, December 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| on four planned bicycle infrastructure projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| Remember we budget money each year for our bicycle infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| And this is going to talk about four of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| The meeting is at 5.30 p.m. in the main conference room at the city's new public work service center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| located at 3131 Morris Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| The city's consultants, Kimley Horn and Tool Design Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| will present concept designs for the four projects which will provide important links| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| to connect existing bike lanes, destinations, and greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| So the projects we'll be talking about are on Chapman Highway between Woodlawn Pike and Fort Dickerson and the Henley Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=896)|
| 0:15:04| Middlebrook Pike between Proctor Street and Western Avenue slash University Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| The third one is Woodland Avenue from Broadway to the existing bike lanes on Woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| And finally, Adair Drive linking to Old Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| This is part of the implementation of the bicycle facilities plan that we adopted last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| And just to give a little context, four years ago the city only had about five miles of designated bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| but from 2013 through this year that total has been increased to 13 miles of bike lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| and 2.4 miles of buffered bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| basically a tripling of the number of miles of bicycle infrastructure in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| So these projects give us a chance to add even more, the ones we're going to be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| So if you want more information, if you have questions or comments, come on out to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| Again, that meeting is 5.30 p.m. this Thursday at the Public Works Service Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| And that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Also on Thursday from 5.30 to 7.30 at the Walter P. Teller Boys and Girls Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| there will be a meeting to discuss the redevelopment of the Walter P. Teller projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=977)|
| 0:16:25| And so I'd like to invite those who might be watching on TV to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| and if you want to find out they'll be given updates on that redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| It's 5.30 on this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| This Thursday, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Council members are familiar with Barbara Ray of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| She's very helpful in all of our campaigns, been a big supporter of Fountain City and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| And I just wanted to note that she passed last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| and we will certainly miss her as we all look forward to campaigns in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| And I know it's a big loss for Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| I forgot to announce another event is also on Thursday, I believe also at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| It's sponsored by Five Points Up at the Walter Hardy Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| There's a Winter Wonderland event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| and some of that will take place also at the Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| So we've got a couple of things happening on, quite a few things happening on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| Anything else from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| Okay, we'll move on now to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1053)|

| 0:18:59| Councilman Dela Vokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| Yeah, I was wondering if Brenda or perhaps our attorney can tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| the state made these changes, but is there a new direction in enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| or maybe Mr. Frost knows, is there a new direction in enforcement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| requires these definitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Well, the state has changed its definitions of what constitutes beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| or high gravity or super beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| And the city is needing to change its definitions to match the state's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| So are they regulating them different somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Well, the cities and local governments are now being given more authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| Previously, 6% is not regulated by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| After January 1st, it will be regulated by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| If someone had just one high gravity beer, that might be enough to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| them over to the police department to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| When you pull them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| We didn't vote on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1207)|

| 0:20:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| 10A is a resolution approving an appeal filed by Robin Easter of the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| of Zoning's appeal decision to deny a variance to increase the maximum area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1218)|

| 0:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| So, Council, I don't have anybody signed up, but Ms. Easter is here, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1242)|

| 0:20:54| I have some printouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Why don't you go ahead and pass those around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| I don't know if I have enough, but Will will help you get those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| Mayor, while she's passing them out, I wonder if Gerald Green can tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| There seemed to have been some, I don't know, debate as to whether or not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| BZA had authority to do anything beyond our existing sign code and zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| that they were limited, so they were, I think, sending Ms. Easter and her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| appeal here, but maybe he has something to inform us about that, or I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| know if he does or not because he's not on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| Gerald, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| No, sir, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| The BZA appeals are handled primarily by plans review and inspections, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| they would have more information than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Peter's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Peter's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Either the law department or Peter may be able to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| It seemed like their hands were tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| They could not do any relief, and I don't know whether one's appropriate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| Just stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| They made those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Hi, Peter Ahrens, director of plans review and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| During the BZA meeting, they noted that there wasn't a hardship for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| increase in size of the sign, so that's why they turned it down, and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1325)|
| 0:22:13| the appropriate location to appeal that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| So now, Robin, if you want to just state your name and address for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| record, and you have up to five minutes to make your case for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| I'm Robin Easter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| I'm representing Knox Whiskey Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| My office is at 132 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Knox Whiskey Works is at 516 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| So what you have in your packet is a small and large version of signage, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| the two smaller examples of the garage door and the side wall sign fit within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| the requirements, and BZA said they could approve the smaller version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| But in those meetings, everyone agreed, and we went for a certificate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| appropriateness, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| Everyone agreed they felt the larger version was a better fit for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| What we were trying to achieve was something that felt more in keeping with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| the historic painted signs in that warehouse district, and in making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| larger, it feels more like a historic sign than an advertisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| If we go smaller, it looks more just like a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| So aesthetically, that's what we were going for, but we do feel like we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| hardship in that we are located down Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| There's construction on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| We're farther enough from Broadway that people won't naturally drive by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| So we felt like we needed something that would call attention from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| Broadway direction to Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| So the gray part of the building is already painted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| It's just a big gray side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| It's not very attractive, and we wanted to just paint over the gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| Just the letters that you see that say Knox Whiskey Works, we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| paint over the existing gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1451)|
| 0:24:22| Is that all you want to say right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| They may have questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Yeah, if you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Mayor, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Go ahead, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| It looks like you want to triple the size of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| I mean, would you have 54, call it 55 square feet, and now you want 175 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| How did you arrive at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| I mean, what was the thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| Or was it just you had a graphic artist, or how did you get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| I'm the graphic designer for Knox Whiskey Works, and we do their brand development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| I do a lot of brand development downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| I'm very aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| We did historic research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| We referenced all of the historic painted signs that are down in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| and we designed it to be the most aesthetically pleasing on the side of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| to where it was readable over the cars and from a distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| And, again, the goal was to make it feel more like a design than an advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1516)|
| 0:25:26| We were trying to take it away from just a sign approach to make it a more artistic approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| So a lot of it was just based on the proportion and scale of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| and then the view from Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| And you said with regard to the doors, like garage door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| the smaller sign was approved, the larger was not, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| If you look, there are two versions of each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| I was told that the smaller version of the garage door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1553)|
| 0:26:02| and the smaller version of the side wall sign fit within our standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| So they said they would approve that as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| but wanted me to go before BZA to get approval, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| or before you all to get approval on doing the larger sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| So it would be our, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| we would be willing to give up the bigger distillery sign on the garage door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| in order to have the larger sign on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| I hope we can hear from our sign committee guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| Vice Mayor Grieve is waving his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| I have no light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| You know, I think this is a good example of what Nick brought up to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| the last time about an entertainment district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| and about the fact that if and when we have those particular areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| that we can look at those in terms of what signage ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| But I think from the standpoint right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| I can't support this because it doesn't fall within the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| of our sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| And if anything, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| there's really not a hardship in terms of showing the signs on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| And to me, it almost borders on a billboard when it becomes this large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| and this size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| And so I think that I'm certainly not going to support a larger sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| in this particular situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| and especially in light of our sign ordinance and what we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| and with the possibilities of what can happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Yes, and I'm going to, in light of what Councilman Grieve has just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| and after all of the years of struggle, so to speak, on the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| I think this will conflict with the new existing sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| And even though it's in the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| I think it's just going to be set a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| and I'm not going to be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Can I say one more thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Would someone like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Council's agreed to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| We scaled it based on the fact that there are large painted signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| throughout that whole area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| so we were hoping that maybe there might be some variance on painted signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| because believe me, I would not want to see a giant blade sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| or a lit sign or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| It was really designed within keeping of what already exists in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| along that Jackson Avenue corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| where you have those building-sized signs painted on the sides of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| Well, those are grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Those were done before the new sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| and as Mayor Brown said, we spent quite a bit of time working on the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| and I think that what I'd be concerned with is the fact that we begin to set a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| and I don't think we're ready to do that at this particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I've got a dumb question for our sign guys, George or Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| If she had the smaller Knox Whiskey Works sign on the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| could she also, like, put a stack of barrels or something outside of the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| but to fill up the gray wall, or is that also a sign because it's talking about whiskey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| Oh, Gerald, do you know how to answer the trick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| I'm going to give my answer and then rely on Peter since he actually administers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| My interpretation, and this is not having been part of the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| just based on my experience, is because they sell whiskey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| the whiskey barrels would be considered part of their ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| It's the product you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| But I'll let Peter answer that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| That's my interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| We'll see if great minds do think alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| I would concur with Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| If they're selling that product, we've had these issues come up before with other businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| and if it's associated with the products for sale, we would consider that part of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| But ten smiling pilgrims would be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| That's on the brand of the whiskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| As long as they're not inebriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| Low-gravity beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| Councilman Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| I guess as an alternative, I mean, you're going to get hit with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| or you're going to bat your eyes maybe at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| but in light of what Vice Mayor Grieve was referencing that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| I would like to see if we can get MPC to look at entertainment districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| where we could have areas where we could have different signage outside of what is in place now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1840)|
| 0:30:50| I'm not saying that this might be one of them, but it could be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| You know, I think that that is a good area to be under consideration for such an entertainment district, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1853)|
| 0:31:01| And rather than this being defeated, you know, we could as an alternative table it to see because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| and correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm thinking that if it's defeated, you can't bring it back for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| as opposed to if we table it, then it's just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| And then if MPC did come back and with council's approval, I mean, there's a lot of ifs here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| but that is an alternative to it just being defeated because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| I'm like Vice Mayor Grieve and Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| I mean, it's kind of hard to say yes to this, you know, because it is a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1894)|
| 0:31:43| As much as I'd like to say yes to it, you know, in light of what we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| So I just offer that as an alternative to you, and if you're favorable, I would make that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| and if council's, you know, approved it, it would be tabled instead of defeated, but that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| And tabling would hold it in abeyance while?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Well, our attorneys are discussing that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| Well, let's see if the great minds agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| If you're saying let MPC study it in the meantime, is there some different district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| District, like an entertainment district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Well, if, you know, there's even question if they're going to get to it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| I mean, I hope in the upcoming year, I hope they can, and this could be considered an entertainment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1941)|
| 0:32:30| And it's just an, I'm just trying to not get it defeated if it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| if the legal minds think that, and council thinks that that's a good alternative as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| I sort of like where Mr. Pavlis is going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| I guess one question I had, one of the things that sort of gave me heartburn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| is that the downtown design review board actually recommended the larger sign, which sort of threw me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| And that's the body that's looking at all downtown design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| So that sort of, I guess that surprised me, and anyway, gave me some heartburn about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| But the other thing that was mentioned in there, and maybe Ms. Easter or Mr. Green knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| they said that the downtown review board is going to look at the sign ordinance as to downtown and make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| Were you aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| Well, Mike Reynolds said the downtown review board met last night for a regular board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| and actually had a workshop to specifically discuss the guidelines in regard to signage in this sign ordinance in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| So they recognize that there's an issue with downtown signage in a way that the current sign ordinance is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| That's on packet page 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| So anyway, I think any efforts that MPC does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| I think it makes sense to coordinate with the downtown review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Ms. Walls, did you have, are you on the review board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| I am, I serve on the downtown design review board for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| So there has been conversation about the downtown design review board guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| One of the challenges is that the guidelines were passed in 2007 originally and then updated in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| Obviously the sign ordinance was done in the last year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| and so there are some conflicts in terms of what's recommended for the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| And as noted, the Jackson Avenue Warehouse District does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| there are some signs of larger proportion on walls that were shown in the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| But obviously with the change to the sign ordinance, there's some conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| So that's what was being proposed to be discussed as part of the staff for the design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| So would the board potentially have recommendations or amendments to the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| or were they just looking at the guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| So the intent, I think, from staff, as we've discussed it initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| is to look at how we can make the guidelines in conformance with the new sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| because of the effort that has gone into that and reduce those conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| Whatever the recommendations are, the board would then forward them to city council for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| because it would require city council approval to any changes to the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| Do we know any type of timeline on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| The first conversation happened about a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| I don't see that moving fairly swiftly, although it depends on how many changes are recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2138)|
| 0:35:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| Gerald, did you have anything else to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| To reiterate what Anne said, my understanding is, as she stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| that the guidelines would be brought into compliance with the signed standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| Remember that the guidelines are just that, guidelines, the standards are dictates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| My understanding, talking with the MPC staff who staffs the downtown design review board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| is that they want to bring those guidelines into compliance with the adopted standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| So you're fixing the guidelines, in essence, not recommending changing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| We're discussing the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Would it be possible for me to withdraw my motion while this is being worked on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| To withdraw your appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Just so that it isn't voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Do you want to? Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| Councilman Tavis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Ron, who wants to kind of explain where we're at on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| We can tag-team it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| It's a pending appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| Ms. Easter did not prevail at BZA, so she withdrew her appeal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| The prior decision of BZA is what would stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| I haven't been able to hear the full conversation going on as I've been talking with the Deputy Law Director Mills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| but I don't know when MPC might get back with the request that Councilman Pavlis put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| and when it might actually get voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| If it was defeated or withdrawn tonight, it's one year before you can bring something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| However, it can be modified in such a way that it's not the same proposal that would be coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| before this body or BZA or City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| What about tabling, which was his recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Well, it's an appeal. There needs to be some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| A resolution one way or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Okay, so question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| I understand what you're saying, and it probably...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Well, if it got defeated, then I think that's where this is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| But so what is the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| How much of a substantive change can her client bring back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2276)|
| 0:38:05| I mean, this one...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| What has to be different about it to be considered coming back with less than a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| The issue is the square footage of the sign that is being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| So if she had some different proposal, I mean, I'm talking not one square foot or two square foot...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| A little bit bigger than that, larger than that, that could be something...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| If she only doubled it, it would be different than what they're presenting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Yes, that would be substantially different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| So the question is, though, if the ordinance changes somehow...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Yeah, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| That's a different ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| So if, in fact, this entertainment district or whatever is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| then she wouldn't even be at BZA necessarily, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| But she can't put her sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| But she can't put her sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| You would have to change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| She'd have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| If what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Well, she wouldn't be able to put her sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| She'd have to wait, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| I mean, she's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Well, she'd have to put it at what's allowed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| George, are you and Duane ready to do another three-year turn in the barrel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| I mean, is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Vice Mayor Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| I think the other thing to be realistic about it is that we've asked MPC to look into our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| in terms of where entertainment districts can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| So there's going to be a process or a time frame in order for that to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| and I know that MPC's stacked up pretty high in terms of things that we've asked them to do so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| But once that's done, even though they come up with recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| it's got to go to MPC and then it's got to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| But just because we say there's going to be an entertainment district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| then we've got to decide what goes on in that entertainment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| So, in other words, if we have an entertainment district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| they've got to come up with their sign regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| Otherwise, just to say we have an entertainment district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| they're still going to have to follow the existing sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| So, again, we're looking at probably quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| I mean, if you consider how long it takes things to go on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| But there is a process they'll have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| But I think that just as Councilman Pavlis brought up the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| I think we're seeing and as we look to the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| we're going to be seeing things like this where there are areas that we can have entertainment districts or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| But they'll have certain restrictions or certain regulations also on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| So, really, since it can't be tabled, then the only we either deny it or they have or she withdraws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2431)|
| 0:40:39| Is she allowed to withdraw at the last minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Does it make any difference to either to her and her client or to Council if it's either withdrawn or denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2442)|
| 0:40:51| It's my understanding if she withdraws it, then the BZA, I mean, her appeal is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| It's denied by the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| So, either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| The way she's got a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| I mean, it's not going to be favorable to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| So the translation is sell a lot of T-shirts that say not for whiskey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| So you have a choice to withdraw or there will most likely be a motion to deny that would pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| With the same outcome either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| I'll let you all decide then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Well, they have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Unless you withdraw it, then they have to vote on it, which would be from my hearing a motion to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2478)|
| 0:41:26| It sounds like it would be better for you to, if you were to deny it, then if ordinances change, then I could come back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| I'll make a motion that we deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| May I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| So, I think this means that I am allowed to put up the smaller options that are within the 70 square feet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2506)|
| 0:41:55| They were approved, you said, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| So, we could put this up and then if you change the ordinance, we could come back and petition to repaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| The ayes have it and the appeal is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| Okay, resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| 11A is a resolution honoring the memory of Alexander Harkness and expressing City Council's condolences to his family upon the occasion of his passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2541)|
| 0:42:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Yeah, thank you Mayor and Council for being sponsors of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Alex was a good friend of mine and probably a good friend of a lot of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| He was a great Knoxvillian for sure, but just a couple of things that was of note that he was involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| He really made a difference in the skyline of Knoxville and a lot of development here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| He and his brother-in-law were active builders originally in the Rocky Hill area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| They also developed and built the homes in Forest Brook Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| They were instrumental in developing with Pat Wood, Town View Terrace, Isabel Towers, Town View Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2587)|
| 0:43:15| And civically, I mean, he's got a list as long as my arm, but of note, he was president of the Home Builders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| He was on the board of directors of the Better Business Bureau and Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| He served on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| And he and Dwight Kessel, I understood in the obituary, were the two city councilmen that survived serving with Kaz Walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2607)|
| 0:43:35| which was quite a feat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| You know, one of the things that I think has really had an impact on Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| was the conversion of the old L&N Depot to the STEM Academy as it stands today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| It's a beautiful building and he was very passionate about maintaining and upgrading that building and did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| But most importantly for Vice Mayor and Councilman Wallace, he served by appointment by Mayor Ashe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| I think he was on the original task force on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| And he survived it for a long time, so you all have got a bright future ahead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| He was a great Knoxvillean and I know this council wants to recognize him with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2654)|
| 0:44:22| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2664)|

| 0:45:09| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2709)|

| 0:46:30| and delivering substandardized wheeled garbage and recycling containers to all city households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| I'd like Will to repeat that please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| For April Fool's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| At least we're not for Secretaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| It's been hard to read that on emergency order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| I'll have to read it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| I've had a couple of calls from some senior citizens concerning these new cans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| and I'd like to ask Chad if he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| He is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| If he would come just to allay some fears from some of our senior and disabled people concerning these new cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2822)|
| 0:47:11| Yes, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Chad Weath, Public Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| One of them I've had conversations with almost daily that you've referred me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| So there has been some talk that the biggest thing that we get is about the size of the garbage containers, especially from elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| I do first want to point out that we always have backdoor garbage service for any elderly over 75 or that has a medical need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| The biggest concern we have gotten is from the size of the containers, especially in condominium complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| Rachel and I are talking to several right now and most of them have agreed to at least accept the cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| And then as if residents aren't happy with them or can't handle the larger cart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| then we will work with them on finding a solution, which we are purchasing some smaller carts that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| we understand will be required for some people, especially in condominium complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Yeah, I just wanted to footnote the same comment that I've heard from several people, including my wife, as it turns out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| But since we started that single stream recycling, I mean, a lot of families like ours have cut our garbage disposal to like maybe a third of what it had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2887)|
| 0:48:20| The recycling train gets most of it and then a few bags of stuff go out, you know, once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| And so it seems a little bit like overkill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| I understand that the equipment is designed to lift these large containers and maybe that's the holdup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| I'm not sure why, but can it lift a smaller container or not as long as it has that little bar and, you know, locking mechanism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| Yeah, it can as long as it's designed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Really, the 95-gallon cart is really a standard in the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| I mean, if you look at several cities that have gone this route, that's typically what they say for a family of four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| whether you recycle or don't recycle, that a 95-gallon container is a standard cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| And they do make smaller ones, but the footprint of the smaller ones isn't much different from the 95-gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| So, again, it's really a standard size in the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| And our consultants, when they were down over the past year, that was really what was recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| So I interpreted your earlier statement as saying you're keeping an open mind if people decide that doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| We are. We do understand that there's going to be some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Like I said, we're in talks with – I spoke to four or five this week of condo complexes that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2963)|
| 0:49:29| some of the residents in there we already know will like the bigger can and will want the bigger can, but it won't work for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| So we are keeping an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| We just ask them to contact us once they get the larger one, and we will switch it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Councilman Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| I think it's worth noting, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but starting January 1, you're no longer recycling glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| So that will be going into your trash can unless you choose –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Let me rephrase that. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Da, da, da.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Unless you so choose to take it to a recycling facility in the city, but it won't be picked up anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| It will not be curbside recycled, but we will be offering it all drop-centered locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| We encourage people to continue like we used to do before the single stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| And explain why. Explain why that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| Again, there's – the market is just – the commodity for glass has become really nil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| A lot of the glass right now also that goes into single stream really gets broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| It is very difficult on a processor to process, and usually when it gets through the entire process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| it is no longer in one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| Co-mingled glass, there's just not a market for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| So a lot of it is being landfilled now and used as landfill cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| If it is separated and it's green glass and brown glass, there is still a market for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Again, if people take it, it usually doesn't get damaged through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| So that's the biggest – that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Well, I just – I mean, I think it's in all likelihood a lot of people will start throwing their glass away from now on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| instead of taking that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| I'm not encouraging that by any means, but, you know, it is quite a – I've recycled for many years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| and taking it is a chore at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| But, yeah, please recycle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Oh, I think it's fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| I just did it on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Oh, barrel of monkeys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| It's a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| You see your neighbors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| Really, I encourage everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| I was going to say, is there some way that you could join with other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| and request for proposals on glass reuse so that maybe some creative genius out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| has found wealth in the ash can kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| Yeah, I mean, I think several cities are looking at different approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| It's just very difficult for – you know, there's always the operation of collecting the glass as well that's always a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| It's just a matter of finding a business or somebody that can do something with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| especially if it's co-mingled with other recyclables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| I can also encourage people to find alternatives to buying your products in glass when you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| knowing that the market's different for glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Reduce your glass purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Ta-ta-ta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Ta-ta-ta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| That'll be the new call, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| I appreciate the time you've spent in answering a number of the telephone conversations that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| but I want to be sure just to reiterate what Councilman Del Voco said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| You are possibly looking at smaller containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| I have a number of people that have called and said that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| they're not the average family of four and that they're really down to one sack of garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| and whether or not they can do it, whether they do the backdoor or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| that they just don't have as much because they do recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| But part of the question had to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| And then what's our ordinance say about not leaving your can out at the roadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| Your can cannot be brought down before 6 p.m. of the night before trash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| and it has to be retrieved before 9, the day of collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| So it basically can only be down there that day of trash collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| Now, if some people who are against the carts, if they put their garbage out in bags, will it be picked up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3187)|
| 0:53:15| We're really pushing for the contents of cart system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Again, the design of the cart, one, to answer your first question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| while we do understand that, you know, your typical family of four might love the 95-gallon toter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| a family of two may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| But the other goal of this is to have a standardized cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| If you look at set-outs when you have a whole neighborhood that has the same cart, it's very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| It's very aesthetically pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| It's not like it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Right now we have just various set-out rates of all types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| So the goal is to have a trash container, whether we do work with the condominium complex for smaller ones or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3222)|
| 0:53:50| But the goal is for all trash to be in a garbage cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| But will their trash be picked up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| It will not be picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| We know there will be a – there's going to be a work process to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| I mean, we understand it will probably be six months of working out the kinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| So we do hope to get picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| I had a conversation with one lady this morning about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| She only has one bag, and she's always just throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| You know, we're working through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| We'll take any phone calls if people have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| But, again, the goal of it is to really control those set-out rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| and not leave trash on the sidewalk that's not in bags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| so we can get raccoons in it, rainwater in it, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Thanks, Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Finally, something we understood, trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| 12C is an ordinance to amend Chapter 17, Article 6 of the Knox City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| by repealing Division 4, Downtown Residential Parking Permit Program in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| I just had a question for Mr. Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| I got a call this afternoon about a resident who lived in a candy factory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| and he was asking about the Fort Kidd lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| and I was wondering if you could just provide us an update on the plan for that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Rick Emmett, Downtown Coordinator, 400 Main Street here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Yeah, we're going to offer the Fort Kidd lot as a city parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| It's been a city parking lot all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| but it's really been used more for the Fort Kidd and also for the Museum of Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| But PBA manages that lot, and so we're going to offer some monthly parking passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| Because what was going on now with the residential parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| was that where they were using parking there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| Yeah, it was a residential parking zone anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| And I think maybe there was some on-street residential parking as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| but a lot of them were already parking up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| so I think that will work out okay for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| The parking permit is only $125,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| so it will be a little bit more to have to park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| but that's what everyone else is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| 12D is an ordinance to release residual utility easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| from three earlier right-of-way closures at 261 West Springdale Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| and authorize the mayor to execute quit-claim deeds to the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| Fey-Roletto Steel Company, Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| 12E is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| to update the City of Knoxville parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| Mayor, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| I'd like to move to send Item 12E, the parking ordinance update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| back to the next regularly scheduled MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| to consider five changes that have come about since they last approved the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3412)|
| 0:57:00| The first change would be to include a link to the City of Knoxville's urban forestry tree list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| The second change would be to modify Section J . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| It has to, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Doesn't it reference the tree list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| It doesn't provide a link, and we want the ordinance to show the link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| Can we just add that ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Anyway, modification of Section J.1 to increase the threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| for application of certain landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| from a 5,000 square foot vehicular use area to a 10,000 square foot vehicular use area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3453)|
| 0:57:40| Three is modification of J.2.D to exclude perimeter screening from properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| with a shared access agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Four is full discussion of parking maximums and minimums included in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| And five is clarification of language provided by the Knoxville Utilities Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| regarding utility maintenance zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| And some of these came about as a result of the workshop we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| and I think they did not all get in to the MPC initial approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| So this is kind of a cleanup for the parking ordinance that we have been looking at for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3493)|
| 0:58:21| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Councilman Dalibopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Yeah, I just had one question for Gerald, and that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| I remember at that last workshop we had several speakers from the development world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| that were talking about special kinds of businesses that maybe needed a bigger either maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| or a different minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| Were they put in the tables?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| I didn't have the comparative information, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| We're still getting comments from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| and the item number, I believe it was item number four on the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3528)|
| 0:58:56| will allow us to discuss those and look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| Because there were some people who actually contacted certain type of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| or worked with certain types and said that wasn't going to work for a certain reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| Keep in mind, too, that there are no absolute minimums and no absolute maximums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| That's a 20% rule, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| And also, with the maximums, you can exceed up to 20% above the stated maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3555)|
| 0:59:23| just by providing pervious surface on those excess parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| You can go even beyond that with the parking study with the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| You can go below the minimum by providing a parking study that shows you don't need those parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| We're looking at those and also adjusting the stated maximums and minimums in the parking ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| It's something that has become more apparent and more viable in other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3583)|
| 0:59:50| There's no minimum for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| I don't think we want to go there, but we will at least mention that to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| Okay, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| I certainly commend MPC for working on this and maybe even at times struggling on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| but the idea that maybe we're overproviding for parking and making seas of asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| is something to be looked at and to be changed as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| But thank you for what you have done thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| Okay, so we have a motion to send 12E back to MPC to consider the changes that Councilwoman Palmer delineated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3621)|
| 1:00:30| We have a second for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| We have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| 12F is an ordinance to close a portion of an unnamed alley from the northeast corner of parcel 108CC032| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| to the southwest terminus at Railroad Right-of-Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| and authorize the mayor to execute quit-claim deeds to the adjacent property owner's Orange-Knoxville-Cumberland LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| Applicant First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| We have two people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| Do you wish to, Mr. Seymour, Mr. Wetzel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| This is your opportunity to address Council as a retiree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| You could change your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| I think you're going to be okay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Quickly, you've got those two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| 12G is an ordinance to close a portion of an unnamed alley from 22nd Street to South 21st Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| subject to conditions and authorize the mayor to execute quit-claim deeds to the adjacent property owner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| Starboard Properties 4 LLC Applicant First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| I want to move to approve on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| I had a conversation with Taylor a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| Well, we've been conversing for weeks about this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| and there's still some detail to be worked out with the law department and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3710)|
| 1:01:58| but I am going to make that motion to go ahead with this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| with the thought in mind that you all will hopefully come together in the next two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| or we'll have to maybe postpone it again or maybe deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| But with your assurance that you're going to work with them, I've made the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Councilman Dalibopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| I guess either Jim Hagerman or Gerald Green, the staff did recommend to deny this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| and it sounds like some of the city engineering review has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| I don't know what the status is, but could you just enlighten us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| What's the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Is it cutting off of straight passage down the alley by having one link taken out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3759)|
| 1:02:46| or what was the nature of the objection, and why are we recommending, at least at staff level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| originally to deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Gerald Green, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| I'll start, and Jim Hagerman with engineering may add to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| There were some concerns expressed from engineering because of the important role that alley plays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| in that section of the street network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| There are a number of one-way streets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| By cutting off the alley, there was concern that there would be limited access for service vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3790)|
| 1:03:18| for residents moving in and out of the apartment complex, and for general traffic movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| There were also some concerns about utilities in that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| For that reason, they initially opposed the closing of the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| That's the reason that MPC, in recommending the approval of the closing of the alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| had the condition that some plans for the development be approved prior to the actual closing of the alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3817)|
| 1:03:46| to assure that those concerns could be addressed in the planning for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| Jim may want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| You're saying like a plan review submission that looks at the actual details?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| A review by the, I believe, the Administrative Review Committee, Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| and by the Plans Review and Inspections Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| It's that review by Engineering that Councilmember Pavlis referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| in trying to assure that that review did not, in and of itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| cause a challenge with the closing of the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Mr. Hagerman, do you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| I think he covered it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| Vice Mayor Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| I just want to say a few things about, as we continue to develop projects along Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| I think pretty much all of us can agree that there's a particular facility on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| that would definitely receive an Onion Award, if not sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| And a concern that I have over not only this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| but also another building that's almost finished on up the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| if you're on Cumberland Avenue and you look at this building, it's fairly ugly on the back side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| And the building that I'm referring to, you folks know which one I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| And so I've had some conversations over the fact that even though we have presented to us some schematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3907)|
| 1:05:14| I do realize that this is just a visual that we're looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| But I do think that we as a city should be very much concerned about what all our projects look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| We've got a number of projects going on all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| and I think that it's time that we really take a hard look at what the aesthetics are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| and be sure that the aesthetics measure up to what it is that we think our city ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| And so I'm hoping this project, the conversations that I've had so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| that this will be a stellar project along Cumberland Avenue as opposed to a couple of the other ones that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| So I hope, again, the city will take heed and make sure that this is one that we can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| A number of the projects that we're seeing that are going on around the city right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| I've used the example before that when I taught I used to tell my students that a lot of times it's difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| when a building's finished to say whether or not we like it or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| because we don't understand the process that people went through to get to the final project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| We maybe a lot of times don't know the construction cost or the kinds of materials or the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| and the building ends up the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| But I think that we can start out with some pretty high standards here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| which I've had a commitment so far, correct, on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| He's looking behind him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| This is a sizable project on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| I mean, when you look at the size, I mean, they're taking up a whole block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| So I just want to say that I will be watching very closely, and I hope the city will also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| Might I inquire, is there going to be something specifically they're going to report back before the second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| Mr. Pavlis seemed to allude to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| Well, I was involved briefly late this afternoon with conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| I would anticipate Mr. Forrester and his client getting together with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| and engineering to try to come up with some language to improve on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| 12K is in ordinance approving an amendment to the South City Sector Plan from open space to general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| property located on the northwest and southeast sides of Severe Heights Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| south side of Wallace Drive, east side of Lancaster Drive, Tom Weiss Applicant, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4052)|
| 1:07:40| I'm going to move to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Tom or anybody from the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| Who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Yeah, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| First off, I want to recognize Linda Rust who has done a stellar job of kind of shepherding this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| Very, on behalf of, she's the president of the South Haven Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| and she's done a very good job of making sure, I don't know that I've ever been involved in a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| and it's been vetted as much as this one has, but there's been meeting after meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4090)|
| 1:08:17| four to five, I guess maybe four meetings were very well attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| and it's because there's a concern about this is coming into a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| but it complements what is going on at the Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4110)|
| 1:08:37| The former Severe Heights Baptist Church has sat empty for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| It's starting to deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| It's starting to attract folks that perhaps we don't want in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| and I think a great majority of the overwhelmingly people supported this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| and the rezoning that is pretty substantial coming in close to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| But with the hard work that all those folks aforementioned, they've done a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| and I think it's going to be just another outstanding project that's going to complement our urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| and everything that we have going on in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| So I'd like for you to just address what the plan is as best as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| You may not have a concrete plan, but I think it's worth the council to hear what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| I'm Thomas Kordewski. I'm 4054 Stillwood Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| and I'm partnered with Tom Weiss on the redevelopment of the Severe Heights Baptist Church campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| It's about a 4.5-acre property, 4.4-acre property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| and has about 80,000 square feet of existing building stock in five different buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| And our intention is to preserve those buildings, all five of them if we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| and it looks like we can, and repurpose those buildings to bring some new life to that community and that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| and to complement, as Mr. Pavlis said, the urban wilderness and what's happening at Baker Creek Preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| So our intention is for it to be a community hub where we can provide hospitality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| we can provide entertainment, food and beverage, all of those amenities that patrons of the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| and I think residents of South Knoxville would enjoy having right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| Councilman Delano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| Thank you, Mayor. Gerald Green, I'm calling you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| If this is in the middle of a neighborhood and the concern at the outset at least was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| why should we go from R1 to C3 and this kind of dramatic leap with residential around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| is C1 neighborhood commercial or some planned commercial, PC something, a better zone, or is C3 the right zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4250)|
| 1:10:59| I mean, I guess I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| No zone in our zoning code is the right zoning designation for what they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| that affords the protections the neighborhood needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| The C3 is with a condition that the use on review be approved as the best fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4270)|
| 1:11:16| We're taking a round peg and shoving it into a very square hole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| but those are the pegs and the holes we have at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| So it's the second look opportunity that makes that the right zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| That's correct, and the developers have submitted a plan to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| for their use on review that addresses the concerns that were identified by the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| in the community meetings, and that will enable the developers to do the development they propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| with minimal impact on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| I think the cooperation and the dialogue between the neighborhood and the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| has enabled this project to move to this point and will assure that it's a successful project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| for the developer and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| So we're on the right track with the right zone number and that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Yeah, I just want to make real clear that it's not jammed into the middle of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| It's four and a half acres. I heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| I just want to make sure that we're not recommending something that's in the actual middle of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4335)|
| 1:12:24| I would have issues with that, but this is the periphery of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| It's just not sitting in the middle of Holston Hills, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| I was looking at the picture and there were houses on three sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| I understand that, but if you're familiar with the area, if you go look at it-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| I defer to you on that because you know more about your South Pax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| I just want to make sure that it's not right in the middle of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| It sits well to go ahead and make this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4377)|

| 1:14:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Thanks, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| I just want to take a quick opportunity to recognize a few of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| Every year we go to the Tennessee chapter of American Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| and we have a conference there where every city from the state gets together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| and part of that is doing a heavy equipment rodeo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| So it's an opportunity for our guys to show off their skills in heavy equipment operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| and I'm pleased to say that we did very well as a city, and we finished third as a team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| and I also have a couple of guys with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Mr. Caleb Melton here to my left finished second in the knuckle boom operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| and Wayne Miley finished second in the high lift operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4488)|

| 1:15:03| and, really, I couldn't be prouder of those guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| and it's why we have a good public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| So I just wanted to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| Maybe you can challenge the bus drivers, and you guys can take them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you very much, and congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4522)|

| 1:16:37| to develop nine to ten apartments in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| He is a student at Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| This property is very close to the campus on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| He sees a need for young people who are working students like him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| to have housing in proximity to the campus of Pellissippi State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| The building is interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| According to our research, there are two houses under the facade that date back to about 1920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| Mayor Brown, I think, is very familiar with the property and knows the history well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| It has at various times been homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| It has been a bookstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| It has been a branch of a credit union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| That's the reason the facade that you see in the photographs of it is presently there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| At some point in time, it was rezoned to C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| MPC considered this and staff recommended approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| and the MPC unanimously recommended approval to you for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| This property has been vacant for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| I know the city is interested in the redevelopment of the Magnolia corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| and it is steps, even though this is a small step like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| that will help focus efforts on that redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| The MPC condition was that a sign be removed from the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Mr. Stevenson has already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| At one time, he was requested to fence the back parking lot, which he has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| He has secured the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| He has also requested meetings with neighborhood groups on his own initiative and has met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4708)|
| 1:18:35| At MPC, there were two speakers against this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| and I assume two of the three speakers tonight may be speakers against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4719)|
| 1:18:46| At MPC, one of the concerns of the opponents was that this would be subsidized housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4726)|
| 1:18:52| which is not a valid legal reason to deny the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| but I can assure you it's not subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| Mr. Stevenson intends to market it to students or anybody else who needs an apartment in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4741)|
| 1:19:10| and we would urge you to approve this zoning tonight and on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4750)|
| 1:19:19| If I may, Mr. Stevenson, again, I do not know what the opponents will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| other than what two of them said at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| If I may, I would like to reserve Mr. Stevenson's time until after the opponents speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| so we know what we're addressing or have one of us have a minute or two of rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4774)|
| 1:19:42| How about our normal process is we do the for and then the against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| and then there will be questions from council, so perhaps you'll have an opportunity then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| All right. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| Mr. Stevenson, come up here and tell city council what you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| and what you intend to do with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| Please state your name and address for the record. Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| My name is Philip Stevenson, 2321 East Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| I have currently owned 2321 East Magnolia as well as three other pieces of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4807)|
| 1:20:17| the corner lot as well as the yellow house as well as the three asphalt parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4817)|
| 1:20:24| From the start, this is my first project I've ever taken on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| I have grown up in Nashville doing commercial real estate with my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| and what my intention is to do here is to provide affordable housing to the working class college student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4835)|
| 1:20:43| who is working every week for that paycheck to pay their tuition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| not the average college student who has the allowance and their tuition paid for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| but good quality people and want to only improve the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4855)|
| 1:21:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| Okay. So now we have Kenny Riffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| Please state your name and address for the record, and thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| Mayor and council, my name is Kenny Riffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| I live at 2320 East Fifth Avenue, which you can probably tell is right behind this building that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4880)|
| 1:21:28| but that's not why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| I'm not here because they sit behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| I'm here because if you take a walk with me from Hall of Fame Drive up Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| as a part of the Magnolia Corridor redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| we recognize that we need business as well as residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| The first thing you run into, almost the first thing you run into, is CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| CAT takes up a lot of space down Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| Pellissippi takes up a lot of space on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| We have a federal release apartment complex there on Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| and sprinkled in between that we have apartment buildings, existing apartment buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| very close to Pellissippi, and we have sprinklings of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| If we are going to redevelop the Magnolia Corridor, we need a good mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| and my concern with this rezoning is we're removing a C3 commercial property out of the mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4941)|
| 1:22:31| Now we have one less building that a business can move into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| We have plenty of apartment buildings up and down Magnolia on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| We still have some houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| We have people who have bought apartment buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| and are converting them back to single-family residences along Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| But I don't see that we can spare a C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| I don't see that we can spare commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| because we want to try to attract businesses into the Magnolia Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| and how can we do that if there's no space there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| And we all know how difficult it can be to get residential properties converted to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4983)|
| 1:23:10| So I'm here to say let's preserve what we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| because there's not all that much of it along Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| The other thing that I thought was kind of interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| I pulled the zoning ordinance for RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| and it's this property that is asking to become RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| And the RP1 states that residential areas thus established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| would be characterized by a unified building and site development program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| open space for recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| and provision for commercial, religious, education, and cultural facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| And that seems like a lot of activity going on in a 100-foot by 175-foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| So I'm not sure why the RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| I'm sure it is to be able to convert this essentially to another apartment building along Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5038)|
| 1:24:06| But I would ask that you consider the need for commercial space, preserving the commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| There are many, many apartment buildings on either side of Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| throughout those communities that could be purchased and developed into the student housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5056)|
| 1:24:24| The other component of the student housing is it's going to be one of those nine units with three bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| and each person pays an amount of money to be in the bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| So you end up with more than essentially nine families or eight families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| You end up with 28 or 29 different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| And then, of course, there's the concern about parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| There are just a lot of issues that if the RP1 is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| I think the community would need to be very attentive to how that is implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| But I would ask that you consider preserving that commercial space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| so that we can attract businesses into the Magnolia corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| So now, James Wallerup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5110)|
| 1:25:17| He's not back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5117)|
| 1:25:24| So do you want to speak instead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| My name is David Nix, 2413 East 5th Avenue, Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| I've been there for like 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| We have kind of spent 19 years kind of fighting high-density apartments or high-density zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5138)|
| 1:25:47| In fact, most of the neighborhood now is a R1A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| which pretty much is down to single-family residence as far as most of the zoning in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5151)|
| 1:25:58| I'm not really here to say specifically that I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| I'm also on the Park Ridge Community Organization Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| Next year I'm going to be vice president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Been involved with it the entire 19 years that I've been in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| And, in fact, last night was our regular scheduled meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| and there was a long discussion about this at our meeting last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| And the outcome of that was about 25 percent went along with Ms. Riffey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5184)|
| 1:26:34| and thought that it should stay as C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| At the MPC meeting, you know, we suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| I'm the one that spoke at the MPC meeting and suggested the RP1, the lower density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5202)|
| 1:26:49| with the stipulation of, like I said, it is two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| There's a two-story craftsman-style building and a story-and-a-half Victorian or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| that has been a fake facade has been put across the front two buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| to make it look like a commercial building, if you can see that in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5224)|
| 1:27:11| So our stipulation was that the RP1, with a stipulation that the front of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5231)|
| 1:27:19| that front facade be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| and then be more in historical fabric of what the rest of the street looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5243)|
| 1:27:30| Because right now it kind of sticks out like a sore thumb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| and what Mr., not to dismiss what Mr. Stephens is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| but to paint it gray with a big orange stripe around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| kind of really was going to look like putting a Band-Aid on a big sore thumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| So that's kind of my stipulation, and as far as the Magnolia Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| they're using that as a hinge pin to say, oh, well, it's the Magnolia Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5271)|
| 1:27:59| and in the Magnolia Corridor there is zoning for RP1 and RP2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| and planned and formed zoning, but at this point none of that's been put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| None of the extra zoning or the special zoning has been put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| nor has the design guidelines been put in place for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| So really we're kind of sticking the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| So that's what I have to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| Mayor, I wonder if I could ask him something before he leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| since he's sort of limping back to the hurt your foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| I've hurt my knee twice, and I reckon I'm waiting on surgery on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| I just didn't want you to have to walk all the way up and back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| Do I understand that there's two separate houses with a facade in front of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| but they're still separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| They're not physically connected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| They're physically connected in that at some point they built a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| in between the two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| So it's one building functionally inside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| One side has been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| I think each side has been developed into different things at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| So it's not like walking into one big open building like this, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| I was curious because I was picturing you saying we sort of lift the facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| and it looks more like everything down the row is what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| Yeah, because that's what I do in Park Ridge is working on houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| and I've found a lot of times if they're going to do something bad to a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| if it takes more work to do something bad to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| they most of the time cover it up rather than tear it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| They're not going to spend the time and labor to tear something out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| tear the whole front of the buildings off to put a fake facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| It's kind of like icing on the cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| They just smear it in front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5380)|
| 1:29:48| In terms of the neighborhood meeting discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| was there concern about it being this kind of multifamily residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| or just its use generally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| You said about 25 percent wanted it to be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| The rest either weren't committed or had some different view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| What's the focal point of your neighborhood anyway in terms of the best use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| Well, we're concerned about more high-density residential in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| because Park Ridge is finally, I think, starting to turn the turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| as far as coming back and coming back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| as far as house sales and the people that are moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| But it's still kind of fragile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| The last thing you want to do when something is just starting to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| is go further in and start stomping it back down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| and start putting more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| And that's not to knock rental or high-density rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| but that's what ruined Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| So most of the group was interested in single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| Most groups are primarily single-family residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| but 75 percent of the neighborhood I think would go along with RP1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| with his plan as far as student, the shared student apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5463)|
| 1:31:11| But I think also, too, with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| I think the bond that we're getting from that would be at least it'll look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| and it'll look like it blends in, it won't stick out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| and it'll kind of blend back in with the neighborhood and not look like a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| We'll hear from the other speakers, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Thank you, Mr. Nix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| John Craig?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| John Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| I'm happy to say I now reside at 2455 East Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| Park Ridge Community Organization met last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| and this project was again discussed at great length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| I was asked to convey to the council the views expressed by the members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| Both these folks were also at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| so this is sort of a wrap-up of the various views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| We've had a number of discussions with Mr. Stevenson about his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| We've appreciated his willingness to seek the input of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| and his actions to adapt his plans based on that input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| The neighborhood organization has been consistently opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| to the original RP2 zoning requested for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| We appreciated the fact that the MPC rejected that RP2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| As you can hear from the neighbors, we've got different views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| The discussion last night resulted in a very similar split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| between neighbors wanting no change in the current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| and those who are open to the RP1 suggested by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| However, that openness is contingent upon some conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| We supported the MPC recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| for removal of the commercial signage for this residential project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| The neighbors willing to consider RP1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| would also like the current commercial façade to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| and the original façades of the two houses be restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| to recreate the original residential character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| We've been working with Mr. Stevenson to connect him to the city of Knoxville staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| to apply for façade grants that can help to defray the cost of those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5576)|
| 1:33:03| But failing that, I think most of the folks would prefer just to leave the zoning as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| rather than take it to a whole new zoning category without those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| The Park Ridge Community Organization wants to be supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| of new investment in the Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| The neighborhood is also committed to encouraging high-quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| The revitalization of Magnolia Avenue is well underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| with a mix of single-family, multifamily, commercial, and streetscape improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| and we want that momentum to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| However, many of us believe that the next 20 to 30 development projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| in the corridor will heavily influence the development path along Magnolia for a generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| We ask for your support of careful planning to ensure that those projects contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| to the success of the existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| and to the unique character of the Magnolia Avenue Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Mayor, could I ask John a question before he runs away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| The thing up in front of us says RP1, I guess, with one condition, remove the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| You're saying a second condition, restore sort of the residential façade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| Well, as you can see, I think in some of your packets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| it is two different houses this commercial façade got put on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| I think that those who were open to the idea of RP1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| at least wanted it to look more residential rather than just having that 80s style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| But you're saying you would have a second condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Yeah, it was a second condition, which was discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| but didn't get conveyed in the MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| I wonder if the gentleman, Mr. Stevenson, could tell us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| Or Mr. Seymour, if you prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| The condition that John Craig mentioned was included originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5681)|
| 1:34:48| MPC took it out at our request, and our request was it's going to require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| some structural engineering, which Mr. Stevenson has going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| to make sure that that façade, removal of that façade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| does not impact the structural integrity of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| He agrees that if you can take that façade away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| and not impact the structural integrity of the building, he's fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| He wants it to look like a residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| Have you reached a conclusion on that, Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| From what I understand and from me personally looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| as well as an engineer that I had come up and look at the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| the roof is sitting onto two triangular trusses that form the façade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5735)|
| 1:35:43| which sit onto a block wall, which is the first floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| So if I was to remove the façade, remove all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| there would be nothing left to hold up the roof, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| When Mr. Nix said that it's kind of like icing on a cake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| it's much more intricate than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| It's a lot more expensive, and it would pretty much just destroy the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| I am for making the outside look better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| but structurally removing the façade would pretty much break my project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| How long do you think it will take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| One of the problems I'm having is I've heard a number of things that could be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| and of course when I look at the other three houses that are along the street there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| I would certainly like to see those two houses be returned to what they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| How long will it take you to present to us an elevation of what you're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| as far as the two buildings go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| I mean, I can get together with my engineer some kind of drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| to make the façade look better within the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| Can you reiterate on what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| Well, what I'm interested in is that I've heard verbiage in terms of what is being planned to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| but I don't have anything concrete that says we're going to try to make the building look like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| or like what you were talking about in terms of your engineer situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| I have two questions in this regard, but the one has to do with what are you going to do with the façade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5834)|
| 1:37:20| and I personally would like to see what that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| and that's why I'm asking you how long before you can present to us some drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| that would show us what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| Before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| Before the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| And then also, when you talk about converting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| how many apartments are you actually putting into the two buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| I am asking for nine apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Right now, the front on the right side of the building would be two apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| one on top of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| They're four bedrooms, just like the commons over at UT at campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| They have four-bedroom apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| Each have their own bathroom and their own kitchen and living area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| Those will be accommodated by a community room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| Eventually, after my other two phases, it should be part of phase three, the community room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| When I try to renovate the basement into a big active area with computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| and workout machines and make it a full-running facility, the building is actually one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5897)|
| 1:38:27| It is all enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| It's one whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| It's not two buildings anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| I'll make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| So there is a connection between the two buildings that stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| It's inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| I'm personally living there with my puppy right now just as security on the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| and I go to school right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| It's heated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| I certainly appreciate what you're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| and I admire the fact of taking these two buildings and doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| but I don't feel like I have enough information to know exactly what it's going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| and I'm sure the neighbors don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| And so what I would like to do is I'd like to recommend that we postpone this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| I have a packet, not with the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| You were asking for what I was going to do essentially with the outside because I'm not quite sure yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| I don't have an answer specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| What I would like to do is probably put some kind of extension onto a roof to kind of bring it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| make it look kind of more like a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| I do have a packet that was put together by my engineer of the inside of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| and a bunch of pictures of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| and essentially what we're going to do written if you guys would like to see that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| For the inside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| But you say within two weeks you could have your exterior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| I'd get right to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| Well, I've been over and I've looked at the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| I've looked at the inside of it, and I'm very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| One of the things, the building has been empty for at least 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| and that is definitely not good for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| You have on each side of that building two apartments already that I don't think have presented any problems to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6005)|
| 1:40:14| Now, I don't have a problem with postponing it to let you present what you're going to have on the front of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6014)|
| 1:40:25| because I think you said you're going to have a problem with the structure trying to change the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6025)|
| 1:40:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| What I was saying is if I essentially remove the whole facade, it's not worth it into the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| It's part of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| I would have to add on to the facade to make it look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| Well, I would support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| Are you making a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| I'll make a motion that we postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| He said two weeks will be enough for you to get information, or do you need longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| A month would probably be ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| A month would be better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| The regular meeting is within two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| They have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| You have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Our first meeting in January is canceled or postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| Yes, so if you go a month, the next meeting is January 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| I'll go two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| I'll get it worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| Two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| I make a motion that we postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Well, I think we spent a lot of time over the last few weeks and few months talking about healthy corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| and trying to get mixed use on corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| And what he's asking for tonight is a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| We're not here to talk about design characteristics or whether we like the design or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| I bet even Mr. Stevenson probably doesn't like the design, but the design is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| He's asking for a zoning to use it as residential use, and that's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6110)|
| 1:41:58| Healthy corridors need a mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| They need people living on the corridor to be able to frequent the shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| Commercial development is going to follow the rooftops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| They're going to follow the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| The people are living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| They're going to support the businesses that are close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| It only makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| That's what we were talking about in trying to create these mixed use developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| and this is what he's asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| I'd be more a proponent to vote it, as we've done on other things tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| vote it on first reading and let's see if he comes back to you with his drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| and if we can get comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| I like the idea that, you know, do you ask him if he could take the facade down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| He's had an engineer look at it, and you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| And so I think you have to take it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| Mixed use is what we're looking for on these corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| It brings a healthy environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| He's down zoning it from C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| There's plenty of other places on Magnolia you can go C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| There's plenty of vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| There's plenty of other properties that can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| I don't think we have a shortage of C3 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| nor do we have a hesitancy to rezone stuff on these major corridors to C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| So, you know, I support it and I support his efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| I think student housing that close to Pellissippi State is very wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| I think it's a component that will continue to develop near that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6198)|
| 1:43:25| And I think he's really wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| I think he's out in front of it, and, you know, I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| So is that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| I make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| We hear it tonight to approve it tonight, and then we can talk about it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| I think a motion to postpone is a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| So we have a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| That's a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| If that, unless you withdraw it, you're going to stick with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| So if that fails, then we go to the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| Well, there's no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| There's no motion otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| I think Duane is going to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| Go ahead, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| Oh, put your light on, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| I don't have a problem with what they're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| In fact, I appreciate what he is trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| but I also know the neighborhood is concerned about, you know, what is going to happen there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| and what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| And if we can find out in two weeks what he plans to do or what he can do with the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| I mean, I'm all for the mixed use also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| I don't have a problem with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| What I'm concerned about is, just like the one gentleman said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| there's two facades there, and they'd like to know what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| And I think when you look at those five houses through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| I think there's an opportunity to do something on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| So I don't object to the two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| However, as a point of clarification, we vote on it the first time, like George is recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6282)|
| 1:44:49| and then it comes back for a second reading in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| Right, that's what Councilman Wallace is saying, if the postponement doesn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6293)|
| 1:45:01| Okay, let me get Councilman Stair and then Councilman Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| I guess I had a question for Mr. Stephenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| If you're going to leave the façade on, are you going to put windows in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| I've already started to try to figure out how I'm essentially going to put the windows into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| I'll have to cut into the façade and also re-secure that four feet that hangs out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6318)|
| 1:45:24| So I will have to build onto the façade there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| It's actually coated with a really bad material they used in the 90s that is actually styrofoam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| It leaks water in between the two layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| I plan to strip that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| And I plan to strip that off from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| I have to get that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| I need to make the building look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| We hope the styrofoam is not holding up the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| Yeah, it's only about that thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| But I would also like to add I'm not using any of the money that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6352)|
| 1:46:00| I'm bringing money to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| I'm bringing people into the community to spend money, the people that actually do have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| And then I guess, Mr. Green, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| I don't know if this will help or further confuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| but the RP1 does require the approval of a development plan by MPC prior to the final approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6380)|
| 1:46:28| and issuance of building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| Although that plan would not come back to city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| there would be an opportunity for public input and public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| And I've heard enough from this council and from the community to have a pretty clear direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| on what the intent of council is and what you want to see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| And would be willing to, when those plans are brought in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| would certainly be willing to show those to any council members for input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| just as a public review part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| Would that be done before the second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| No, it would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| I think we would not want to consider it until we knew the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| because we can't approve a plan until the zoning is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| And I think it will take Mr. Stephenson some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| It's a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| I mean, I'm concerned here, Mr. Seymour, Mr. Stephenson, whoever wants to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6444)|
| 1:47:29| I mean, can you do this in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| I mean, you agreed to do it, but I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| What I would essentially do is immediately get in contact with my engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| He'd probably come right back up here to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| We'd look at the facade, and I'd just get him immediately drawing something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| The best come up with exactly what he can do in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| I'm not exactly sure, but I'm pretty sure he can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| When he came up with this packet, he came up, visited me twice in the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| or that was three times in the matter of two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| and he got this packet out in about two and a half weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| And it was a lot of work and a lot of measurements and things that we had to do for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| And so, I mean, I like to see it move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6496)|
| 1:48:22| I mean, I really commend what you're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| And as our friend Bob Wetzel was hearing, as Councilman Wallace said, retail follows rooftops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6506)|
| 1:48:35| I mean, I've been hearing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| We need this to start in East Knoxville, and this is a beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6518)|
| 1:48:46| I think we're sending a bad message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6526)|
| 1:48:53| If you came back in two weeks and you didn't have it, then we could postpone it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| But I just want to make sure that you're not just agreeing to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6538)|
| 1:49:04| I mean, I'm just curious if you can really get that done in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6544)|
| 1:49:09| I mean, what would be drawn out is more like a shed roof style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| and to match kind of the main entrance on the points like the yellow house I own down on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| I mean, I've already thought through this ever since it was come up that the façade needed to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6559)|
| 1:49:27| I wanted the main front entrance to be a key point and to have windows cut through the façade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6567)|
| 1:49:34| and then to have kind of another roof off of it to get the lines more divided up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6574)|
| 1:49:43| I understand what you're trying to do, but my concern is can you really get this person up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6583)|
| 1:49:52| your engineer or whoever it is, and get this done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| I mean, if you can, then I'm going to go along with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6595)|
| 1:50:01| I just don't want you to put yourself in a hardship just to agree to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| I guess what he's really saying, he's going to try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| And the engineer who is from Middle Tennessee, is he Columbia or Franklin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| Columbia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| His family has worked with him for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| I'd like to speak into the microphone, please, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| The engineer is from Middle Tennessee, has worked with his family business for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| and I assume will do the best he can to meet that deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| Trust and free enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| It will get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| Well, it's got to go to MPC anyway, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| It's got to go to MPC anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| It's got a design review in it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| I had planned to support this, and I still do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| but it sounds as this discussion proceeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| it might be good to give him at least a month rather than two weeks to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6659)|
| 1:51:06| So I'm going to make a substitute motion that he come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| Well, we have to hear the postponement first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| We have to hear the postponement first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| Just one item, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| Gerald Green, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| I've been thinking, Peter Ahrens came down to reinforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| if City Council approves a design for this as part of the zoning, you're binding MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| MPC has provided the authority through the zoning ordinance to approve the development plan for this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6693)|
| 1:51:44| Maybe I'm going to look to your attorneys here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| To what extent can, through this zoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| can City Council bind MPC to approval of a certain design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| when that authority is delegated to MPC through the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6715)|
| 1:52:03| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| I'm not asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| What I'm asking for is the information that we've been given so far about the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| and I understand what you're talking about, is that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| I know that we're rezoning a piece of property to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| and all I'm asking for is what is it that we're going to do to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| I think the neighborhood is concerned about what we're going to do to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| Now I understand we're talking about punching windows in that front facade and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| I just think that somewhere along the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| we have a responsibility to look at not only the fact of what's happening on the Magnolia Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| but we need to raise the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| We need to raise the aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| And I appreciate the fact, and I'm glad you made the clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| that you are going to have the plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| But, you know, other people come to us and they bring us packets of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| when we talk about zoning and this sort of thing, and so that's all I'm asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| is I'm asking for additional information on what this is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| And that's why I'm asking, and I think the dialogue that we've had says that he feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| he's going to try to get something back to us within two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| I'm not against the project. I think it's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| I think Magnolia Avenue needs this sort of thing to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| But I think at the same time that with the neighborhood and with the surrounding areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| that we ought to be cognizant of what the aesthetics of whatever it is that we're doing as we move forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6804)|
| 1:53:31| And I'm not making this a condition on the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| but I think that I would like to have more information in terms of making a decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| Call for the question on the two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| Okay, so here we have a motion to postpone two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| If that passes, then in two weeks you will hear it on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| and then the second reading, if there is one, would be January 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| If this fails, then there's still an opportunity to entertain another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| All right, so the motion before us is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6847)|

| 1:54:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Okay, let's do a roll call so we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Councilman De La Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| Okay, the postponement fails five weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| Okay, is there another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6872)|
| 1:54:42| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| Okay, a motion on the second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6888)|

| 1:54:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| We have one no, so it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| Motion passes to approve 8 to 1 for the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6895)|
| 1:55:03| 12-0 is an ordinance appropriating the sum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| of $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| I didn't have a light so I'm waving my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| I'm sorry, Vice Mayor Grief, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| I would just, author, I would just encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| that in on the second reading that we see what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| that they're planning to do on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161206?start=6917)|
