| 0:12:44| of which 36 of them live in the Knoxville Empowerment Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| We've ran on average a 69 to 31 food to alcohol ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| The 69 is our food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| I'm bringing this out because I just want you guys to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| we take pride in that building and what the downtown grill and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| brewery stands for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| On our latest health score, we got a 95 in the kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| a 96, a 98 on the bar, upstairs and downstairs bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| That is outstanding for a 104-year-old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| I'm quite comfortable in saying that any inspector or city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| state, and county concerning the building and restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| the fire inspector, health inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| elevator inspector, or state, that I've always met and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| exceeded any requirements that they've asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| My goal is to be there a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| and I think that our reputation is outstanding as to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| carding that we've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| We've been open since, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| 2002, and we're currently open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| We've gone out of our way, knowing that UT is next to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| we've gone out of our way not to encourage the UT group to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| in because we understand that is the underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| I don't do any advertisement on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| I won't do anything in the beacon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| We don't rent out the space for any of the sororities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| or fraternities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| As of this year, we stopped doing bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| We do a jazz band on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| We don't allow smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| We're closing at 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| That makes us probably one of the earlier closing bars in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| We started doing that when we stopped doing the bands because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| if anybody has ever been into the downtown grill and brewery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| my age that I hit, our age factor is going to be 30 to 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=887)|
| 0:14:54| years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| That's what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| That's what I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| We have a policy and we're known that we card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Could you, and you've established very clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| you're quite reputable, if you could just tell us what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| going to be doing in this remedial plan that you didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| because you had a good first remedial plan and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| something happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=916)|
| 0:15:16| So what are you going to do differently to ensure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| don't see you here again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| I didn't say what a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| We don't want to be seen here again, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| And like I said, just a brief instance on the first instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| the employee that she did card, they admit she carded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| she misread the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| She's 34 years old, single female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| She'd been with us for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| When she found out, she broke down and she started crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| She's no longer employed with us, but it should be noted that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| it's our understanding that the case that she originally had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| had been dismissed with her doing ten hours of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| service and her retaking the ABC class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| She's currently working with another downtown restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| We wrote up our carding policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| I think we have one of the stronger carding policies in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| We've asked many people any suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| Unfortunately, in September 21, we had a 26-year-old black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| single mom who had been with us for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| She saw eight people at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| She carded all four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| The three otal ones before, she actually acknowledged the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| I'm just on had a birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| But then she carded the guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| She just, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| And when we met on the first instance, Officer Tracy told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1011)|
| 0:16:59| that the problem is maybe that they're getting so familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| with, they ask for the card, they think that the card's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| getting them out of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Or since then, you're seeing a revised plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| We now are doing a mandatory night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| And this was provided to us from Pouncey or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| Kim Pouncey from Top Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1043)|
| 0:17:23| We've asked everybody to give us suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| We now, every employees that come into the restaurant have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| take this 90-minute video, have to take the test associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| We are now making them doing, we haven't reached the time yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| that we're doing quarterly, but it's going to be a mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| review quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| And I mean, if you go into the restaurant, we have the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| We now, if you, on a remedial plan, we've told people, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| don't know if it's going to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Zero tolerance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| We've told the managers now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| If these people, and you know about it, the assistant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| managers, we're going to, you're terminated too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| So, this isn't just going to be the employees that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| We're looking at the people that are in charge of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| If they fail to do their duty also, we card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| That's, we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Do we have any questions from the members of the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| So, when the, you said the lady no longer was employed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| and why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Both of them, neither one of them are with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| The one, basically on the first instance, she had for probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| a three to four day, for a period, for three to four days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1126)|
| 0:18:53| every time I saw her, she looked like she was having a nervous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| These were old employees of ours, more than, I'd say, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| had 40 employees that have been with us over the entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| So, you think that an employee that had been a good employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| as you said, all of a sudden you put them out the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| We did terminate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| We, she made that suggestion, and unfortunately, the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| instance was, since the first instance, we, she just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1162)|
| 0:19:30| basically, she left on her own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| The second instance, to be quite frankly, was a 26-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| black female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| Since we had allowed the other one, we didn't have the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| in place to terminate immediately, but now, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| I didn't want to open up a can of worms on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| Plus, like I said, she's a single mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Now, I don't know really what race has to do with it, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| disappointed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Discrimination and the force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Okay, well, I've got the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| I'm just, it always aggravates me that management failed, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| the employee suffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| And, you know, it's about training, and if it had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| repeat, repeat, repeat, then I'd get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| But admittedly, she had been a good, long-time employee, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| it's just more of something to me that I don't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| I just don't think that's the answer to it or the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| But the thing is, you know, like I said, we're kind of asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| we've been in business for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| I have no idea how many times the cadets do this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| I've asked Officer Tracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| She says we have a good reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| Billy is a security, outside security on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| He knows the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| We ask him, what is our reputation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| From what everybody is telling me, we have a good reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| It's not about your reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| You've got a fine restaurant, and you're an upstanding citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| and I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1269)|
| 0:21:09| It just really gets in my crawl that a person who really, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| these hard times, has been an eight-year employee, that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| feel like that that was the answer, the solution to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| We did not terminate either of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| They left on the one, the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| I understood you say you terminated the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| No, no, the first one left on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| The second one, we were going to catch 22 because we did not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| a policy of zero tolerance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| We, one of the big issues at every lineup, we have lineup two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| times a week, I mean two times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| Besides having at every terminal, we have the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| that's a legal day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Okay, I get all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| I'm just making a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Excuse me, do we have any other comments from the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| Okay, you have submitted a second remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| You have strengthened some of the things that you did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| necessarily execute in the first plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| So, with the approval of the board, we will accept this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| and hope that we see you again as people who are customers of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| your establishment and not here on the other side of the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Well, and one thing, I mean, I'm open, we, I've told everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| if you can give me a better policy because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| we didn't terminate either of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| We've had to take that position because we got put in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| position when they knew the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| They just misread the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| In the police report, they say they carded them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| So, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| Okay, you've got your policy, so let's proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| And the next administrative hearing is the Magnuson Hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1383)|
| 0:23:15| Hi, if you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| My name is Flora Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| I'm a permittee, and my address is 7621 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| You have submitted a first plan, and it had, I think, four points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| And then you have submitted a remedial plan for the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| time that has four of the same points with three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| or four new points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Obviously, the first time, your plan didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| And the second time, you have included four of those same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| points plus three additional ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Could you tell me why you think this plan is going to work this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| time and it didn't before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Well, because the management is going to be more intensive on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| the meetings, and we're going to personally check the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| lighting, the signs, and the dates for that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Have you actually installed the better lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| under the bar lip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Yes, ma'am, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| You have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| And do you have something on the register or someplace else that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| verifies the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Yes, ma'am, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| And at the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| And do you have pin lights for the folks at the front door and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| for the servers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Yes, ma'am, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| And you are going to have quarterly meetings about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Who's going to teach these quarterly meetings and where are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| you getting your information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| The quarterly meetings will be held by Mercedes Long, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| the manager of the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| And where is she obtaining her information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| She obtains most of her information from the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Which she attends regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Does anybody have any comment or anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| I would like to suggest that you might want to consider looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| at the Metropolitan Drug Commission has a kit that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| The previous folks in here from Downtown Grill and Brewery have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| moved to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| There are some private companies that also provide some training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| The manager of your hotel, I'm sure, is well qualified for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| lot of things, but the fine points of this particular end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| your business might be something that would benefit from some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| additional help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| Board members, are you ready to accept this plan that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Councilman Delavaux, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| I was just saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1556)|
| 0:25:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Well, we would hope to not see you again on that side of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| And we also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Thank you, Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| We're going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1569)|
| 0:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| If you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Alan Morton, 1820 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| You have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| This is your second opportunity to improve your procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| What are some of the things that you're doing now that you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| not do the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| What are some changes you've made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| Well, a lot of the things are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| I mean, we meet with the employees every night on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| nightly basis now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| We remind them, you know, what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| We regularly change the color of the wristbands that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| You know, nobody can get access to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| Nothing like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Like I said, we teamed with Cherokee Distributing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| They send in people regularly and they report back to us how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| the bartenders did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| We ourselves send people in to test them, see if they serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| And we've also contacted the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| They have a lot of good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| You know, we've got the little placards by every one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| registers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| If I come into your bar and I am 19 years old, immediately, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| you look at my driver's license, how do you know I'm 19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| She's really 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| And it's a Tennessee driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Well, if you're underage, they're the other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| I believe that there's a red stripe on that license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Yeah, there's a red stripe on every driver's license for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| someone who's underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| And so, immediately, you should be able to look at that license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| But I'm glad that you've done these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Anybody have any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| If I may, what specifically happened in these two incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| they were correctly carded and marked at the door with X's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| their hands, but the bartender in each situation failed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| check for the wristband is what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Do I understand that they were not underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| They just didn't check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| No, they were underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| And correct me if this is still what's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| If the person's underage, they're marked with X's on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| backs of both hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Oh, that says don't serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| They need to take a black marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| But no one looked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| No, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Well, we hope that you have great success with this and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| if we see you again, it's because we're patrons of rumors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| not because you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| We have two folks signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| The first is Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Madam Chair, the folks are here that we postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| So if it would please the Board, I think we should probably, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| don't know if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| We voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Probably have somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| We need to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| We need to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| I'll move to reconsider the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Los Fuentes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| That is the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| I don't know how you say it, but I'll trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| Los Fuentes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| Is that fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Hi, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| If you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1778)|
| 0:29:46| You need to speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Anageli Navarro and the address is 2525 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| The applicant listed has not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| We still need the copy of the sales tax registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| certificate of zoning from MPC, and fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Do I have some kind of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| I'll make a motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Now, you understand that when you get everything done, you will get your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| So you need to get in for processing, and you need to get the inspections finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Now, we have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| We're ready for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| First person is Richard Brown from the Payne Avenue Baptist Church, and this is regarding the Casanova Bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1838)|
| 0:30:46| This is a reminder to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Casanova came before us several, a couple or three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| They were not here, and so it died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| And there will be someone from Casanova who also wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| But Mr. Brown signed up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1863)|
| 0:31:07| Richard Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| I'm pastor of Payne Avenue Baptist Church, which is located at 2714 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| My personal residence is 708 Sunnydale Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1874)|
| 0:31:23| As our congregation, we are greatly concerned regarding the granting of the beer permit to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1883)|
| 0:31:32| establishment that is immediately across the street from our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| And as I've researched a little, and perhaps you can enlighten me that there is a section of 4-66,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1898)|
| 0:31:50| which spells out the area in footage, location, closeness of the business to list several things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1910)|
| 0:32:01| and church being one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| We've had several unfortunate incidents in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| and we feel that this would not be a step in a positive direction for us to have the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1929)|
| 0:32:19| being sold in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| I'm sure most of you know the other things that have gone forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| and with it being so close to our church location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| And so we are requesting that we would not allow this to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| I guess I need to make a comment first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| At the present time, Casanova does not have an application before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| It's my understanding that they may want us to reconsider or to consider their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1968)|
| 0:32:54| But right now, as we are sitting here, we do not have an application from Casanova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| but someone from Casanova is scheduled to speak next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| What is the distance from the church to the establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| Pastor Brown, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| The document states that it needs to be within 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| How far within that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Because we're right almost a little bit before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| I don't recall what they're applying for, but Section 4-66 Part A, if it's an on-premise permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| it is the 300-foot distance requirement as measured from the building line to building line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| by the shortest possible distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| If it's an off-premise, it's 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| And then there's the exception, which everyone's aware of, if they have a liquor permit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| So I guess it all depends on what type of application they are seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| It's 300 feet or 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| And pre-existing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| But it's building line to building line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Yes, by the shortest possible distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Is it pre-existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| It's not a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| It's a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Thank you, Pastor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| And we will, if this board decides to consider this application, stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| You'll know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Now, we have Asma Ayesh wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2069)|
| 0:34:38| If you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| My name is Asma Ayesh, 2715 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| And here's my manager, Maurice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| And my name is Maurice Watson, and I'm just a manager there at Casanova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Could you tell us what you'd like to talk about, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Casanova is a convenient food mark, and we're a new establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| And we consider ourselves to be an asset to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Now, I'm aware of what Pastor Brown is speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| There has been incidents that happen within that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| They don't happen over at Casanova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| They haven't happened since we opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| And I really consider us to be a community, I mean, an asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| We also have customers since being open that have came in and started a petition to grant us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| you know, further success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| So, we're just trying to allow ourselves the opportunity to further our success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| So, tell us on the Beer Board what you would like us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| Your application came before us once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| You were not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| We dropped it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| So, tell us what you want to have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| Reconsider our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Excuse me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2149)|
| 0:36:08| Mr. Frost, would you explain to us what the process is on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| Because it's a little bit different than our normal procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Well, for a motion to reconsider, a party who voted to deny the permit or did not postpone the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2174)|
| 0:36:26| that's the proper person to make a motion for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| And if I recall correctly, it was nine to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| So, any member of the Beer Board can make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| And it would have to pass by a supermajority because it's not being done at the same meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| where it would take a just irregular majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| So, it would take six votes or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| When we considered this before, I believe it died for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| So, now, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| It came here, no one appeared, and it died for a lack of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| And so, it's a dead application as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| In other words, doesn't that end the application when it's not acted upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| That was my understanding also, but I'm not the lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| It's been a while since it's been up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Former Chairman Pavlis is nodding his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Unless he's just doddered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| It wasn't voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| It was not voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| It just died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| It died for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Yeah, there was no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| And that would essentially kill that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| So, they're free to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| And they would have to go back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| So, because there was no motion, it died from lack of a motion, you would need to reapply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| start from ground zero, and reapply for your beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| But they probably have a lot of the paperwork already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| But you probably have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| You probably have the paperwork pretty well finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| So, you need to resubmit that with the appropriate fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| And then, if you get that in on time, we could consider it on December 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| It would have to be in by November 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Okay, December 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| All your paperwork would have to be submitted by December 3rd so it could be in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| And then it would come before this board on December 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Madam Chair, do we know how far this structure-to-structure distance is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| I mean, is it more than the 50 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Or are we doing a futile act here if they're within 50 feet of a church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| It's still going to be unlawful under our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| Sergeant Hunter, did we measure that or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Part of the application is measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Well, it's his grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| It is grandfather?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| What was at the site you were at now before you took it over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| I beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| I didn't quite understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Was there an establishment at the site you were at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| You've opened a brand new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Okay, so there is no predecessor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| So what will happen is that you're off premise only, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| It would have to be measured, and it would have to be, if it's 50 feet within that church, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| It's more than 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Also, but, you know, we will look at your application again when you submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Madam Chair, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| You said you had a petition from persons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| Just customers since we've been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| We've got over 1,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| 1,000 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| Perhaps you could submit that with your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| While there's certainly anybody certainly welcome to submit a petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| I'd respectfully submit that that's not one of the criteria for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| and whether or not a beer permit is granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| If, you know, if these people meet all the requirements, pass all the applicable background checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| state law is going to mandate the granting of this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Is there any other business before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| I think Reverend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Pastor Brown, would you like to come back up to the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| Perhaps I need some clarification on the terminology that I'm hearing because in one instance it talks about 300 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| and now I'm hearing 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| So can someone define for me what the parameters of what we're dealing with so we'll know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2439)|
| 0:40:47| Our attorney here can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| You correctly referenced Section 4-66 of the city code, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| You referenced Part A, which is off, excuse me, on premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| That's if you are drinking the alcoholic beverage on premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| And this is like a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Off premise is a, which is Part B of the section, is a 50-foot distance for an off premise permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2471)|
| 0:41:21| And Part D of the section, there's an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| If an entity has a liquor permit that's been issued by the state, then the distance requirements are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2487)|
| 0:41:36| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Wait until you finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| I thought you were asking me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| Then there's a, if you have that liquor permit, then those distance requirements go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| So off premise means then that I'm to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Package of goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| It's like a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Convenience store, grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| You're buying it to take home and drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| To take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| So who monitors if I buy and drink outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| What happens then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| It's reported to the police and they will monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Because that's not what that business is, I mean, that's not what's supposed to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| But, I mean, but the reality of it is that there's no one there until 911 call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| and all the other stuff happens to say, oh, you shouldn't be doing that on these premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| And I think that we would be perhaps better served to deal with, I know we have law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| and all those things that we have to adhere to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| But I think the reality of the situation is the propensity is there for the other type of behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| which is why the other store that was right across at the end of our parking lot was shut down by the nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| situation and now it's just moved across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Well, I certainly don't pretend to speak for the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| but they are familiar with the past circumstances of a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| And I'm sure the owners know by your all's presence here tonight and concern for it that you all will be watching them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2579)|
| 0:43:07| But, I mean, all you can ask is for the laws to be applied equally, no matter the type of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| no matter the location in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Mr. Frost, in terms of the owner, I think it's the same owner for that business, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2604)|
| 0:43:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Different owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Well, on the previous application, it was a relative of the owner of the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| But this is a relative that's not prohibited by law from applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| We'll need to see whose names are on the new application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| So, in an instance like that, if everything is done as it's supposed to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| it would have to be a change in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| If we, if this board voted to deny, we cannot vote to deny according to the state law, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2640)|
| 0:44:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| The applicants stand on their own merits or their own flaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| I mean, surely most people have a relative that's done something they're not proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2656)|
| 0:44:24| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121127?start=2669)|
