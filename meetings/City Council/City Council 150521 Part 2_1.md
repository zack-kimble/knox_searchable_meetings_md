| 2:30:21| I think a lot of credit has to be given to those planning commissioners that serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9021)|
| 2:30:25| and give probably six to eight hours a month at a minimum to address our development and zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9025)|
| 2:30:34| And you should be very proud of the way that these commissioners are serving the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9034)|
| 2:30:41| When I've just been sitting here for the last hour, hour and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| I just realized how much MPC really interacts with so many city departments and agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9044)|
| 2:30:50| from the police department to public works to engineering, parks and recreation, transit, codes, development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| I mean, it's incredible where all of our paths cross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| and it's a very intense opportunity for us to continue to work in that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:08| But it's also very important for us to be able to do that and to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| and look for where this community wants to be in the next 15 to 20 or 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9071)|
| 2:31:19| We are really working towards building our agency and the budget that I have put together here is utilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:29| and the requests that I've done through the city and the county is building on the resources that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9089)|
| 2:31:34| and not dip into our fund balance that we had to do this past year to meet our operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9094)|
| 2:31:40| And that reflects it in our increased request to the city of Knoxville and to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9100)|
| 2:31:46| At this point in time, we seem to have a good reception from Knox County and the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| for our budget request to be able to meet our ongoing operating costs through fees, grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9110)|
| 2:31:55| and the money that we get from the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| Proposing in our budget a 2.5% salary increase and then additional increase in costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9120)|
| 2:32:05| that are going to occur for ongoing operating costs, insurance, and related things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| So we have also had changing in staff, and I just want to make clear that we are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9131)|
| 2:32:18| last year we have lost probably over 100 years of planning experience that was at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9138)|
| 2:32:24| and provides service to the community. And that is a challenge for us to build internally now staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9144)|
| 2:32:32| that can be able to pick up that experience and knowledge and gain that experience and knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| So my goal has been, at least as interim director, and I hope it will continue to move forward in my role at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9158)|
| 2:32:45| is to build the staff and their experience and knowledge and training so that they can better serve the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| and this community. And finally, I want to indicate that we are continuing to be very actively involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9171)|
| 2:32:57| with our agency and as my other hat that I wear with the Transportation Planning Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9177)|
| 2:33:03| working on transportation issues that are not only locally but are regionally that impact us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9183)|
| 2:33:09| from a regional perspective because the city of Knoxville is the heart of East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| but we are all connected, interconnected, and we must work together from a regional perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| if we're going to meet the challenges of this community. And I think many of you were here a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9199)|
| 2:33:25| approximately when Secretary Foxx was, we were honored to have him visit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9205)|
| 2:33:31| and he spoke a lot of just those types of issues of how, you know, you need to have a vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9211)|
| 2:33:36| you need to have a plan, and you need to be able to find ways to implement those plans at the local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9216)|
| 2:33:42| but also be able to think regionally as you're considering your growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9222)|
| 2:33:48| With that, I'll answer any of your questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| City Council has kept us very busy with a number of studies this past year, a lot of challenges that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9232)|
| 2:33:59| but we are continuing to move forward in addressing those challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9239)|
| 2:34:04| and the issues that have been brought forward to you from the City Council and to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9244)|
| 2:34:10| Thank you, Jeff. This $905,000 is city. What does the county provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9250)|
| 2:34:17| The county provides to us approximately $646,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9257)|
| 2:34:25| I requested $685,000 this year for this upcoming year through a combination of a small increase in revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9265)|
| 2:34:36| and reduction of fees to MPC that we pay the county for trustee and building utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9276)|
| 2:34:44| I believe at least the mayor's budget is meeting that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9284)|
| 2:34:49| Our request to the City of Knoxville was for $975,000 for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9289)|
| 2:34:54| which reflects, again, increased operating costs and not having to dip into our fund balance for ongoing operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9294)|
| 2:35:03| With the city giving $900,000 and the county giving $600,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| do you keep track of your services that you provide to the county versus the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9309)|
| 2:35:15| Do you provide more services to the city than you do the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:19| Yes. The request through the city and through the administration is a lot more activity growth that we're going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9319)|
| 2:35:28| From a development standpoint, there's more development, i.e., new development going on in the county, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9328)|
| 2:35:34| but there's a lot more redevelopment that we are seeing here in the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| through infill housing, through historic zoning, through downtown design review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| A lot of these other parts of MPC in the city that we are staffing are very busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9345)|
| 2:35:53| and the projects are becoming more and more complex and more and more complicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| as they're dealing with different types of uses that are coming in, different types of approaches to development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9358)|
| 2:36:03| and that's even true out in the county. All the good land has been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9363)|
| 2:36:08| Now those marginal pieces of property are looking for redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| and that is really challenging both staff, the commission, the public, and the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9372)|
| 2:36:19| Thank you. I'm just curious, is your overall budget those two items plus contract work you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9379)|
| 2:36:27| or is there state monies or other monies that MPC is able to utilize in carrying out its mission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9387)|
| 2:36:33| Approximately a third of our budget in the past has been state and federal grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9393)|
| 2:36:41| and they're primarily through the Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9401)|
| 2:36:46| That we receive over, probably manage close to $2 million goes through our budget that is transportation-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9406)|
| 2:36:54| One million of that is just passed through to nonprofits for the purchase of vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9414)|
| 2:37:00| and federal transit money that we manage, and about a million of that stays at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| for the staffing of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| We receive about around $575,000 to $600,000 in fee revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9429)|
| 2:37:14| and we anticipate that to be about the same as last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9434)|
| 2:37:18| It could increase as we see that, and the rest is city and county fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9438)|
| 2:37:23| When you say fee revenue, is that when a developer comes in and submits his use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| or his plans for review and that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| You were doing work for Lenore City and some other cities in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9451)|
| 2:37:34| Are you still doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9454)|
| 2:37:36| I mean, that's through the Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9456)|
| 2:37:39| I see. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9459)|
| 2:37:40| That we do our urban and regional transportation planning efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| and we have several contracts with the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| and actually with the Federal Transit Administration for those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9466)|
| 2:37:50| Do you do any planning work for the community of Farragut, or is that totally separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9470)|
| 2:37:54| Just transportation planning is all we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| The only thing we do for the town of Farragut is just through KJS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9477)|
| 2:38:02| and street names and addressing that assistance in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9482)|
| 2:38:05| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| Seeing none, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9491)|
| 2:38:12| Oh, goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9492)|
| 2:38:15| Ms. New.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9495)|
| 2:38:18| So the zoo is on the top of page 17 in the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9498)|
| 2:38:25| Hello, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9505)|
| 2:38:28| Thank you for having us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| We'll also be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| We have handouts that we'll leave behind with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| Hopefully it will answer any additional questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| And I have with me my Director of Finance, Glenn McGuire, handing out the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9518)|
| 2:38:45| And my Chairman of the Board, Eddie Maness, couldn't be here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| but he said to tell all of you hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9528)|
| 2:38:51| Who is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9531)|
| 2:38:52| Eddie Maness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9532)|
| 2:38:53| Who is Eddie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| How soon we forget, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9536)|
| 2:38:57| How soon we forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| Well, again, thank you for allowing me to come today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9539)|
| 2:39:03| The zoo's operational budget impacts the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9543)|
| 2:39:07| As most of you know, we've been talking about it a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9547)|
| 2:39:10| but by contributing this year or last year $29 million to Knoxville's economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9550)|
| 2:39:15| and also by serving as a community resource that's part of Knoxville's cultural vitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9555)|
| 2:39:21| The 2015 operational funding report that you see in front of you supports tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9561)|
| 2:39:26| marketing, education programming, new guest experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9566)|
| 2:39:30| and continued improvements to park amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| The Knoxville Zoo requests the $1.2 million operational allocation that's planned for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9573)|
| 2:39:38| in our current contract with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| Also, we always like to talk about some of our numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| We're a top 20 attraction in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| and we're the city of Knoxville's most visited attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| Last year was our second highest attended year on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| We welcomed nearly 417,000 guests to the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| and over 58% of those were tourists that traveled greater than 50 miles to see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:06| As I mentioned before, those tourists bring $29 million to the local economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9606)|
| 2:40:10| and they're responsible for 402 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9610)|
| 2:40:14| We have competitive pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| We partner with other agencies like Visit Knoxville to promote visitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| and we advertise heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| So the aggressive tourism marketing plan we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| paired with our new animals, interactive experiences, up-close opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9625)|
| 2:40:30| beautiful grounds, and continually improving amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| helps ensure the zoo remains highly competitive as a major tourist draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| and economic driver to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9638)|
| 2:40:41| And the city's operational funding is an absolutely critical component to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9641)|
| 2:40:47| The only other thing I really wanted to mention was the educational impact that the zoo has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9647)|
| 2:40:52| Last year over 88,000 people were reached through our education programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9652)|
| 2:40:57| Ninety percent of those were through outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| primarily to local and regional schools and community centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| In 2014, over 35,000 youth attended the zoo on field trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| Eighteen of those were kids from schools within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9668)|
| 2:41:13| who received a reduced or free admission of a value of $228,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9673)|
| 2:41:18| As you also know, last year we completed the most comprehensive strategic plan in the zoo's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9678)|
| 2:41:24| Part of that plan is our vision to become the destination for fun learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9684)|
| 2:41:29| and memories that last a lifetime, and we're well underway toward that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9689)|
| 2:41:34| We've just finalized an ambitious master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| which will bring transformational change to the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| With the support of the county as well as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| we've begun design plans for the beautification and enhancements of Timothy Street and Zoo Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9703)|
| 2:41:49| providing excitement and building anticipation to promote the zoo as the city's major destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9709)|
| 2:41:55| Later this summer we'll break ground on Tiger Forest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| a $6 million immersive experience showcasing our work with endangered Malayan tigers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9718)|
| 2:42:04| There's less than 50 of those tigers in the United States, less than 500 left in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9724)|
| 2:42:09| And this is just the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| We're committed to remaining and growing as an economic driver for the community and a cultural treasure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9731)|
| 2:42:18| and you're our critical partner in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| So with that, thank you, and I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| Lisa, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9747)|
| 2:42:28| I notice $1.2 million in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9748)|
| 2:42:32| Does the county participate as we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9752)|
| 2:42:36| Certainly the county participates, but not near to the level of funding that you all provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| So if you see in our budget handout, oh, gosh, it's several pages in, is our budget outline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9761)|
| 2:42:49| The city provides about 11.5% of our overall revenue budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9769)|
| 2:42:56| The county last year contributed about half a percent, $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9776)|
| 2:43:02| This year that's quite a bit higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9782)|
| 2:43:07| and that's in addition to or not including their contribution through the Arts and Cultural Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9787)|
| 2:43:15| The funding that they did give us that's outside of our operational budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9795)|
| 2:43:20| $650,000 for the beautification of Timothy Street and Sioux Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9800)|
| 2:43:26| Councilman Walz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| Lisa, last year you talked about the $10 million gift from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9808)|
| 2:43:34| How have you leveraged that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9814)|
| 2:43:35| I think that was one of your big things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| If you got it all at once, you'd be able to leverage it into additional gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| Talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| Did that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| Did that strategy work out well for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| Well, it's all still in development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| We have begun our work on design and planning of Tiger Forest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9826)|
| 2:43:51| and then the master planning, the concept design of the rest of those projects that the $10 million would help support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9831)|
| 2:43:58| And then we are working our way toward a capital campaign plan that would make those additional requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9838)|
| 2:44:06| But it's helped you raise money for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9846)|
| 2:44:10| It has certainly helped create the buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| It's also we've gotten quite a few additional contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9852)|
| 2:44:16| including $400,000 the past two years from the state toward Tiger Forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9856)|
| 2:44:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9862)|
| 2:44:23| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9865)|
| 2:44:26| Lisa, there's some land on the east side, I guess that's the west side of the zoo, towards Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9866)|
| 2:44:34| Is there any effort to acquire that before it gets developed or, you know, unaccessible to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9874)|
| 2:44:41| We have looked at that property, and it is not completely developable for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9881)|
| 2:44:48| We are interested potentially in that property as part of our capital program if it were affordable more as a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9888)|
| 2:44:56| Right, you don't want something negative next to you right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9896)|
| 2:44:59| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9899)|
| 2:45:00| But we are not actively pursuing that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9900)|
| 2:45:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9904)|
| 2:45:06| And then a facetious question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9906)|
| 2:45:08| Can you lend some of your tigers to Holston Hills so we can get rid of the coyotes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9908)|
| 2:45:12| Well, I only have two, so I better keep them where the guests can enjoy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9912)|
| 2:45:19| And you were answering to Mr. Wallace's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9919)|
| 2:45:22| When do you see that campaign really getting the momentum to get on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9922)|
| 2:45:26| and start, you know, leveraging the fundraiser that the $10 million will help you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9926)|
| 2:45:32| We are currently interviewing consultants to help us with that plan, with the campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9932)|
| 2:45:39| We anticipate doing feasibility and strategy studies this summer and to be going by fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9939)|
| 2:45:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9950)|
| 2:45:51| Seeing none, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| Ms. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9956)|
| 2:46:01| CAC is on page 18 of the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9961)|
| 2:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9966)|
| 2:46:07| I'm Barbara Kelly with the Community Action Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9967)|
| 2:46:11| And I have with me David Mincy from our Finance Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| and Jason Estes from Housing and Energy Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9975)|
| 2:46:22| And thank you all for your ongoing support for everything we do at CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9982)|
| 2:46:29| And I'm really pleased that the budget that you're considering today includes funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| that we requested for a 2.5% salary increase for CAC staff who work hard every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=9994)|
| 2:46:43| meeting the needs of the people we serve, our neighbors, your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| And of course, CAC is like a jigsaw puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10008)|
| 2:46:51| I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| The unique thing about it is that some of the pieces are enormous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| and some of them are teeny tiny, but we've got to put them all together to make the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10018)|
| 2:47:05| And some of them are adequately funded, and many of them just struggle to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10025)|
| 2:47:12| But all of the 450 employees at CAC need to be treated equitably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10032)|
| 2:47:18| and so your support makes it possible for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10038)|
| 2:47:24| And I guess I do want to comment again that although the weather is really nice now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10044)|
| 2:47:31| this winter we really saw what our staff meant to us, their dedication and their determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10051)|
| 2:47:39| Meals were served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| Emergencies were met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| And I'm just proud to say that not one scheduled dialysis appointment was missed in all of that bad weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10063)|
| 2:47:51| So it's going to be really good to recognize those individuals with this pay adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10071)|
| 2:47:56| And if things go well, this will be the first time in many, many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10076)|
| 2:48:01| that we've been actually able to have a salary increase effective the 1st of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10081)|
| 2:48:06| Usually it takes us a little scrambling around to see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10086)|
| 2:48:11| So anyway, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| In the interest of time, I'll just hit on one or two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10094)|
| 2:48:18| Our homeless prevention work continues to be very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10098)|
| 2:48:23| Although there are evictions at KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10103)|
| 2:48:26| none of the residents who receive CAC case management services are evicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10106)|
| 2:48:33| or they are alternately placed in more suitable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10113)|
| 2:48:38| And we currently have 103 KCDC residents on the active caseload,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10118)|
| 2:48:44| and the budget that you're considering includes continued funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| for this very important case management initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10129)|
| 2:48:54| And we also appreciate our relationship with the Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10134)|
| 2:48:59| and the work that we're able to do to provide home repairs and interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10139)|
| 2:49:04| to improve our affordable housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10144)|
| 2:49:07| and to help homeowners and renters live safely and comfortably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10147)|
| 2:49:12| while at the same time we're improving our lower income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| And I've said this before, but I do want to remind you that CAC continues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10157)|
| 2:49:22| to be a really good investment for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| We work really hard and successfully to bring other resources to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10165)|
| 2:49:32| Last year we mobilized over $23 million in federal and state funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10172)|
| 2:49:37| and more than $6 million in private funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| accounting to an 11-to-1 return on each local city and county dollar that's invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10181)|
| 2:49:47| And I'm always proud of the fact that 20% of the money we actually spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10187)|
| 2:49:54| comes from private sources, which means that every time CAC spends $5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10194)|
| 2:50:00| some person takes his or her dollar out of their pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| and contributes that to the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| And I think that speaks really highly of the dedication of the staff and the volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10208)|
| 2:50:13| and the generosity of the community because we do it without a PR staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| and with no development staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10218)|
| 2:50:20| So it really speaks to the responsiveness of the community to the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10220)|
| 2:50:29| And I guess I would like to say that it doesn't always have to be a large amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10229)|
| 2:50:34| that this week I received three letters from the Akema Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10234)|
| 2:50:39| providing awards to CAC programs amounting from $800 to $2,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10239)|
| 2:50:45| and a letter from the Trinity Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| And these amounts, when your neighbors, people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10248)|
| 2:50:52| recognize what you're doing and contribute the money that we have raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10252)|
| 2:50:57| it means every bit as much as the large grants that we receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10257)|
| 2:51:02| from primarily federal sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10262)|
| 2:51:07| A lot of the work that we do is in direct services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| but we also do a lot to create partnerships and to advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| and to work on mobilizing resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10274)|
| 2:51:18| And we're really about to see that approach kind of pay off next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10278)|
| 2:51:24| in the impact in the energy and weatherization area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10284)|
| 2:51:29| I was just amazed yesterday, I was thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| if we relied on the federal funds that we receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10292)|
| 2:51:38| next year in the whole Knox County, we would weatherize 21 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10298)|
| 2:51:47| Because of the partnerships that we have with the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10307)|
| 2:51:51| with TVA, and with KUB, we will be weatherizing 751 homes next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10311)|
| 2:52:00| 751 homes the following year, and because of the Roundup Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10320)|
| 2:52:08| we will have a sustainable funding source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10328)|
| 2:52:12| for this important intervention going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| And so I would just, with that upbeat note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| I'd just like to thank each of you for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10338)|
| 2:52:22| and for the trust and for the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| And I just want to say I always appreciate the kind words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| and the acknowledgement that I receive from each one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10348)|
| 2:52:32| when I see you throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10352)|
| 2:52:35| It really does mean a lot. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| And so I'll just stop and see if you have any questions or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10362)|
| 2:52:44| Thank you. A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| First of all, the homeless model that you have used has been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10366)|
| 2:52:51| The absence of evictions or getting people into a better suited location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10371)|
| 2:52:56| is really admirable, and I think that the spirit of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10376)|
| 2:52:59| has spread to some other organizations who address the issues of the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10379)|
| 2:53:04| So I commend you for that and keep it up, I guess, is the cheerleading part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10384)|
| 2:53:09| And the other thing, this weatherization deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10389)|
| 2:53:13| will weatherize about 1,600 homes within the next two years with the TVA money and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10393)|
| 2:53:19| and then the sustainability through the KUB rounding up is amazing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10399)|
| 2:53:25| I get very disappointed with property owners who have rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10405)|
| 2:53:31| but they don't think about the cost to the people who rent the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10411)|
| 2:53:35| with utilities and some of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10415)|
| 2:53:39| So I think this is a great example of private-public partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| and this is also a payoff of that study that IBM did with us and made some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10422)|
| 2:53:49| So instead of pouring money with subsidizing utility bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10429)|
| 2:53:54| now we won't be pouring that money down that rat hole, I guess is the nice way to say it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10434)|
| 2:54:00| or maybe not such a nice way to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| But we'll be getting something back, and I think that this is a real positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| So I commend CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| We have an incredible amount for many, many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| who most of us don't see or think about every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10452)|
| 2:54:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10456)|
| 2:54:17| I do think that it's really important, the weatherization work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| If you've ever seen families, as I have seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10460)|
| 2:54:23| who are so excited about getting a housing voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| and being able to move into an affordable, quote, house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10466)|
| 2:54:31| and then they get hit with that first utility bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10471)|
| 2:54:34| and realize that the overall situation is not affordable at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| And then when we realize if you're in subsidized housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| and you lose your utilities, you are also subject to eviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10483)|
| 2:54:48| So this can really play a very substantial role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10488)|
| 2:54:53| and it's big enough to have, I think, an impact that we are going to be able to analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10493)|
| 2:55:00| and to actually look at and be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10500)|
| 2:55:03| And it's going to make a really big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10503)|
| 2:55:06| And it all comes through the partnerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10506)|
| 2:55:08| because if it wasn't for the good relationships with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10508)|
| 2:55:11| and the good relationships with KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10511)|
| 2:55:15| and taking advantage of the Smarter Cities opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10515)|
| 2:55:18| I don't think this would be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10518)|
| 2:55:23| Councilman Delbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10523)|
| 2:55:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10524)|
| 2:55:25| I want to join Councilman Palmer, and I'm sure everyone else would too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10525)|
| 2:55:29| in saying we appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10529)|
| 2:55:31| We know that you kind of squeeze as much work out of every penny as you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10531)|
| 2:55:36| and it's really impressive what you do with that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10536)|
| 2:55:39| I have a question that I probably should have asked Michael Dunthorne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10539)|
| 2:55:43| but I'm curious if you have any observations about how we might, what, not discourage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10543)|
| 2:55:50| but find a way to have people not aggregating on lower Broadway and by the Mission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10550)|
| 2:55:56| It saddens me every time I drive through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| and see 40 or 50 people just hanging around waiting for the next dinner bell or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10558)|
| 2:56:04| and I wish there was some way they could be productive or engaged and involved in something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10564)|
| 2:56:10| And that's probably beyond your bailiwick, but maybe you have a thought in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10570)|
| 2:56:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| Well, I actually, you know, whenever I have an opportunity to meet with Burt Rosen at CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10576)|
| 2:56:24| he frequently says, well, I'll come to you, and I always say, no, I'll come to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10584)|
| 2:56:29| because I think all of us need to take whatever opportunities we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10589)|
| 2:56:34| to actually see how some of our neighbors spend the day in what's called the Mission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10594)|
| 2:56:43| I do think it would be wonderful if there was some way that there were some day programs available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10603)|
| 2:56:48| but I also understand that CARM and the Salvation Army, who provide the primarily CARM, the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10608)|
| 2:56:57| are really, you know, not totally equipped to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10617)|
| 2:57:02| There are some small, you know, BMC provides some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10622)|
| 2:57:05| and there are some day shelter opportunities available, but it's a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10625)|
| 2:57:13| If I had an easy answer, I would implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10633)|
| 2:57:18| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10638)|
| 2:57:19| It just, you think, well, it must not be very rewarding to be sitting there all that time just hanging around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10639)|
| 2:57:25| I think it's off-putting to people who are walking down the street and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10645)|
| 2:57:29| but I think more importantly, those individuals must not feel very productively engaged in their everyday life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10649)|
| 2:57:36| Well, and I think the thing you also need to realize is that many of the people are not well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10656)|
| 2:57:40| Some of them are in poor health and having to get up in the morning and spend the day on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10660)|
| 2:57:48| except for coming in for meals until it's time to sleep in a shelter bed at night is not an easy situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10668)|
| 2:57:59| And, of course, we try to do everything that we can to prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10679)|
| 2:58:06| I mean, the efforts that we have, if the people who we work with at KCDC were not facilitated to keep their housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10686)|
| 2:58:16| they would be among the people that you're expressing concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10696)|
| 2:58:20| because there would be no alternate housing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| Case workers get out and work with them before they get in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10703)|
| 2:58:27| And trying to focus as much on prevention as we possibly can because some of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10707)|
| 2:58:33| well, we have the situations, you know, at Flinnegan, that's wonderful, and in Villa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10713)|
| 2:58:38| I mean, it's just wonderful when people can have this type of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10718)|
| 2:58:42| but it's not feasible to do that in every instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10722)|
| 2:58:48| And so I personally am a strong advocate of prevention, trying to keep people housed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10728)|
| 2:58:55| and a lot of what we're focusing on here with weatherization will keep our affordable housing stock truly affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10735)|
| 2:59:05| so that in time, as we're working with the people who are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10745)|
| 2:59:10| at least we won't be channeling and funneling more people into that unfortunate pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10750)|
| 2:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10758)|
| 2:59:21| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| I see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10764)|
| 2:59:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| We'll now go to the city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10767)|
| 2:59:30| Judge Rosson, I see you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10772)|
| 2:59:33| On page 21 in the middle of the page, it's fund 213.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10773)|
| 2:59:52| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10792)|
| 2:59:53| Thank you for inviting us over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| We're always glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| We have submitted a proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| We certainly would ask you to consider it, and we think it's a good budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10798)|
| 3:00:02| and we'd please ask you to consider it, and I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10802)|
| 3:00:09| Come on, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10809)|
| 3:00:10| Don't let him off that easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10810)|
| 3:00:11| There's got to be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10811)|
| 3:00:12| There's got to be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10812)|
| 3:00:14| I think you're batting 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10814)|
| 3:00:16| I try to be nice to the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10816)|
| 3:00:18| Judge Rosson, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10818)|
| 3:00:20| Are any of the, I don't know, things like e-tickets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10820)|
| 3:00:24| or any of the electronic innovations affecting how you do business in a positive way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10824)|
| 3:00:29| In other words, are there some things that will be happening as we get smarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| with our IT technology that make your job a little easier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10833)|
| 3:00:38| The answer to that question I think will be yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| but we haven't actually started getting the e-tickets yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| We've got just regular citations still being issued on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10843)|
| 3:00:48| So I'm looking forward, I guess, to trying that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10848)|
| 3:00:50| and giving you a report as soon as I can, but they haven't actually started doing it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10850)|
| 3:00:53| I think they're getting close to starting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10853)|
| 3:00:55| I know they've got the, I know the police department is getting together the mechanics of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10855)|
| 3:01:00| but we haven't actually seen the e-tickets yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| Parking is doing it, parking tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10864)|
| 3:01:06| And I heard you speak, I guess it was at Town Hall East recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10866)|
| 3:01:09| and you were talking about the state-created tool of taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10869)|
| 3:01:14| or suspending someone's license for not paying fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10874)|
| 3:01:17| but what, did you say 25 percent of the folks just keep driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10877)|
| 3:01:21| and don't worry about not having a license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10881)|
| 3:01:23| It was some huge number that was scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10883)|
| 3:01:26| I think it was 24 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10886)|
| 3:01:27| That was reported in the new Sentinel, I think, about, I don't know, maybe a month or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10887)|
| 3:01:32| It had been reported a couple of years ago before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| It's not just a problem here, it's a problem everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10894)|
| 3:01:37| I mean, people are driving without driver's licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10897)|
| 3:01:40| And insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10900)|
| 3:01:41| And insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10901)|
| 3:01:42| And so you should keep your uninsured motorist coverage paid up for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10902)|
| 3:01:45| But it's just a, you know, there's a certain segment of the population, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10905)|
| 3:01:49| that will try to get to work, I guess, and just can't afford the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10909)|
| 3:01:53| As you know, car insurance is not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| And the state legislature has passed a law making it a mandatory $50 fine plus the court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10916)|
| 3:02:03| If you get caught driving without insurance, the court costs are $101.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10923)|
| 3:02:06| That's $151.50 to get caught driving without insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10926)|
| 3:02:09| The law used to be that I could, if somebody would come in and did not have insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10929)|
| 3:02:14| I could reset the case, and if they would go buy the insurance, I could then give them a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10934)|
| 3:02:19| But the state legislature passed a law saying I couldn't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10939)|
| 3:02:23| And so they made it a mandatory $50 fine and court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10943)|
| 3:02:26| And you may have noticed this past session they passed a new law that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10946)|
| 3:02:31| I think they're going to start towing vehicles for people that caught driving without insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| And I can't imagine where that's going to wind up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| But in any event, it's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10958)|
| 3:02:43| And I'm sorry I don't have the answer to exactly how it's going to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10963)|
| 3:02:47| But we do suspend the driver's license if they don't pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10967)|
| 3:02:51| It's an automatic, electronic thing that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10971)|
| 3:02:55| Last question is, I guess, is there any tools you need from City Council for your toolbox to make your world work a little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10975)|
| 3:03:04| I mean, is there anything in terms of ordinance, amendments, shifts that you think would help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10984)|
| 3:03:10| And maybe that's hard off the cuff, but we certainly would consider something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10990)|
| 3:03:16| First of all, I appreciate your all support that you continue to give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=10996)|
| 3:03:21| We appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| The IT part of this is probably the most important part, not the electronics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11003)|
| 3:03:27| And anything we can do to upgrade that and update that and stay on top of that really helps us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11007)|
| 3:03:32| And, of course, if we become extremely efficient at doing, like, suspending driver's licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11012)|
| 3:03:37| we've gotten a lot better at it, I think, over the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11017)|
| 3:03:41| Up until fairly recently there was some disconnect, I think, between the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11021)|
| 3:03:45| and some of the courts around the state because the electronics were not talking to each other in a particular way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11025)|
| 3:03:51| They're talking to each other a lot better now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11031)|
| 3:03:53| The city of Knoxville has done something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| I'm not confident enough to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| I can tell you what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11039)|
| 3:04:00| So after this meeting last year, we talked about collections at city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11040)|
| 3:04:06| And so we asked MTAS to do a study and help us to identify where some of the issues may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11046)|
| 3:04:12| And somehow through that study, MTAS was able to let the state know that they were not following through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11052)|
| 3:04:18| and notifying people that they were going to be losing their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11058)|
| 3:04:21| And not only were they not doing that in Knoxville, but they were not doing that across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11061)|
| 3:04:25| So we don't really know how that got reported back to the state from MTAS or from whomever, but it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11065)|
| 3:04:30| And so they're working really hard to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11070)|
| 3:04:32| And we've seen an uptick just recently now that they're correcting that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11072)|
| 3:04:36| But we're going to be working with city court on e-citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11076)|
| 3:04:39| and how that process is going to work for the city here fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11079)|
| 3:04:44| We're going to have a sit-down meeting to really start that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| and make sure everybody has all the resources they need so that it functions properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11086)|
| 3:04:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11091)|
| 3:04:52| You mentioned at Town Hall East, but I've forgotten, the percentage of collections you have on fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11092)|
| 3:04:59| In other words, you said it's one thing to have the hearing assess the fine, the court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11099)|
| 3:05:05| It's another thing to get paid necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| What was the percentage of collections that you more or less experienced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11107)|
| 3:05:12| I don't remember a percentage of collections that I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| but I remember talking about the percentage of the people that come to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11114)|
| 3:05:17| The breakdown I can give you on that is about a third of the people that get citations just mail them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11117)|
| 3:05:21| They just don't come to court or come to the window and just pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11121)|
| 3:05:25| We never see them in the courtroom, that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| About 24 percent just don't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11128)|
| 3:05:32| They don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11132)|
| 3:05:33| They don't pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11133)|
| 3:05:34| They just keep on keeping on and hope for the best, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11134)|
| 3:05:38| And that leaves about 40-some percent that do come to court, somewhere between 40 and 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11138)|
| 3:05:43| And then they come in and ask for a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11143)|
| 3:05:45| A lot of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11145)|
| 3:05:46| They come in and ask for a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11146)|
| 3:05:47| They come in and ask to go to traffic school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11147)|
| 3:05:48| They ask various questions, and some of them have some legal training and some of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11148)|
| 3:05:53| A lot of them have seen courts on television and want to have their day in court, which they're absolutely entitled to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11153)|
| 3:05:59| Very few people come over there with lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| I think that's an interesting statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| I have days that go by that I don't even see lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11163)|
| 3:06:06| So it's the people's court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11166)|
| 3:06:09| It's the citizen that comes in that's accused and they want their day in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11169)|
| 3:06:13| and we're certainly very glad to give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11173)|
| 3:06:16| Valley might be able to respond to what percentage we collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11176)|
| 3:06:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11180)|
| 3:06:21| Do you have a figure you can give them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| It depends on if you're talking about the tickets that are outstanding as far as the traffic citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11184)|
| 3:06:37| Collections are up as of January, very much so because of what is going on with the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11197)|
| 3:06:43| because the letters are going out and people are calling because they're getting letters saying their licenses are going to be suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11203)|
| 3:06:49| So I would say that right now we are about at 45% as far as the total collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11209)|
| 3:06:57| So it is going up, and revenue is up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11217)|
| 3:07:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11221)|
| 3:07:02| If I could add to that, in the traffic ticket situation we have a hammer that we can levy on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11222)|
| 3:07:09| If they don't pay, we can suspend their driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| But by contrast, for everything else that the city writes, such as an animal ordinance case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11231)|
| 3:07:16| or a disorderly conduct case or parking ticket appeals or anything that's not traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11236)|
| 3:07:21| codes enforcement and those sorts of things, we cannot suspend their driver's license if they don't pay those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11241)|
| 3:07:27| They're not related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11247)|
| 3:07:28| They're not related to traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11248)|
| 3:07:29| Now, I think there is a statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11249)|
| 3:07:30| I think criminal court has got a statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| If they don't pay their court costs, I think they can suspend driver's licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11252)|
| 3:07:35| And, of course, if you don't pay your child support, you can get your driver's license suspended for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11255)|
| 3:07:41| But those are special legislative acts that apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11261)|
| 3:07:45| So I don't think we can suspend for them not paying a dog case, can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11265)|
| 3:07:50| You can't put them in the stocks in the market square or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11270)|
| 3:07:53| Can't do that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11273)|
| 3:07:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11274)|
| 3:07:55| Let me go to Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11275)|
| 3:07:58| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| That is a no-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11280)|
| 3:08:01| No-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11281)|
| 3:08:02| Did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11282)|
| 3:08:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11283)|
| 3:08:04| Judge, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11284)|
| 3:08:05| How many citations of traffic are issued a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11285)|
| 3:08:09| And then the percentage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11289)|
| 3:08:12| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11292)|
| 3:08:13| Just out of curiosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| I would say a year, it is approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11295)|
| 3:08:29| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11310)|
| 3:08:35| We've got some monthly tolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| Yeah, there's approximately 10,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11319)|
| 3:08:45| And these are single citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11325)|
| 3:08:49| For instance, when KPD writes a citation, and their numbers may be a little different than ours because they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11329)|
| 3:08:56| For instance, if one citation has three violations on it, then, you know, they will count each violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11336)|
| 3:09:04| Whereas when we get it, we do it just per citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11344)|
| 3:09:08| So those numbers may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11348)|
| 3:09:09| They count all three offenses and you just treat it as one citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11351)|
| 3:09:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11352)|
| 3:09:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11353)|
| 3:09:14| Because they keep up with it a little different than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| Do we, does, is Knoxville, do we run about the same as other cities in the state as far as collections on citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11358)|
| 3:09:25| as far as the percentage of collections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| Are we pretty much similar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11367)|
| 3:09:31| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11371)|
| 3:09:33| Especially now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11373)|
| 3:09:35| I think when we had, when we were down some last year, a lot of that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11375)|
| 3:09:42| was because of no one's license was getting suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11382)|
| 3:09:47| So if they had a citation that they weren't paying, then there was basically no penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11387)|
| 3:09:52| So now that licenses are being suspended, you know, our collections are up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11392)|
| 3:09:58| But as Christy had mentioned, that was a problem that was all over the state as far as collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11398)|
| 3:10:05| and people not getting their license suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11405)|
| 3:10:08| And some jurisdictions have other problems that, well, not problems, but they can even arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11408)|
| 3:10:19| And at one point in time, the city was able to do that, to issue warrants for citations that were unpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11419)|
| 3:10:26| But we're no longer able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11426)|
| 3:10:30| But we estimate that for the year, you know, the $5 electronic increase that was put on tickets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11430)|
| 3:10:37| you know, when KPD added that on to help pay for the e-citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11437)|
| 3:10:43| I think that that's going to probably bring in an estimated $110,000 or so extra in revenue as far as that goes per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11443)|
| 3:10:55| And, again, because of the state now doing their part to help us out when it comes to the suspensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11455)|
| 3:11:06| we just hope that we continue to see an increase in what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11466)|
| 3:11:12| Has Knoxville ever had like a forgiveness day or something where you'll clean your files out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11472)|
| 3:11:22| You want to tell us something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11482)|
| 3:11:25| It's election year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11485)|
| 3:11:26| You might want to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11486)|
| 3:11:28| It's never too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11488)|
| 3:11:29| Where there's a parking ticket or something that, you know, you can just pay the amount and not all the increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11489)|
| 3:11:34| Have you all done something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11494)|
| 3:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11496)|
| 3:11:37| Seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11497)|
| 3:11:38| No, we've never thought about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11498)|
| 3:11:41| Well, if Jim works back to the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11501)|
| 3:11:46| I guess before we did anything like that, I certainly want to talk to Jim about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11506)|
| 3:11:50| It has happened in the past, to answer your question, but what's really going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11510)|
| 3:11:55| there are certain people that come to court periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| In fact, they probably come almost daily now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| We have certain people that come down that are indigent, and they will ask me to suspend on an individual basis their fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11519)|
| 3:12:07| and or court costs, either all of them or a portion of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| One group in particular, the veterans group, has organized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| and they are, because their veterans have been automatically discharged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11535)|
| 3:12:19| there's a program here in town now that the Public Defender's Office is very much involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11539)|
| 3:12:24| and going through the courts to try to help a lot of veterans out that have fines and court costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11544)|
| 3:12:28| and these sorts of things suspended so we can get them back on their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11548)|
| 3:12:32| It's called Operation Stand Down, and we participate in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| and we have clerks that are assigned to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11556)|
| 3:12:38| and every year we have a group of veterans that come down from all over the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11558)|
| 3:12:42| and we have them fill out affidavits of income, that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11562)|
| 3:12:46| and if they meet the qualifications, then we will suspend 100 percent of their fines and court costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11566)|
| 3:12:51| because of their service to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| And other people come down that just are down on their luck and have just lost their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11573)|
| 3:12:57| and some of them are fresh out of prison and want a fresh start and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11577)|
| 3:13:02| and I consider each one of these cases on an individual basis and consider their ability to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11582)|
| 3:13:06| We have them fill out an affidavit of income and expenses, and I put them under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11586)|
| 3:13:10| We don't have the ability, of course, to go out and do any independent investigations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11590)|
| 3:13:14| so I'm making a very subjective decision about what I'm going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11594)|
| 3:13:18| and I always hope I'm doing the right thing when I do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11598)|
| 3:13:21| but I will excuse periodically fines and court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11601)|
| 3:13:26| Sometimes all of it, sometimes part of it depends on what they present to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11606)|
| 3:13:34| Throw yourself on the mercy of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| Your Honor, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| Thank you, Judge, for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11619)|
| 3:13:40| It's always good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11620)|
| 3:13:42| He was mayor for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11622)|
| 3:13:43| You have forgiveness day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| Are you going to pay for that park down there that Delavoke wants the money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11625)|
| 3:13:54| I would point out that there has been an amnesty day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11634)|
| 3:13:58| but it predates me and I've been here 27 years, so it's probably been 30-plus years since we've had an amnesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11638)|
| 3:14:06| It's a $100 special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11646)|
| 3:14:07| You come in and clear the boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11647)|
| 3:14:12| And that brings us to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11652)|
| 3:14:21| Are we good to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11661)|
| 3:14:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11662)|
| 3:14:23| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| It's been a lightning day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| It's a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11667)|
| 3:14:28| I've learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11668)|
| 3:14:29| I always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11669)|
| 3:14:30| Two or three things that I highlighted today I just want to go back and talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11670)|
| 3:14:34| and they've addressed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11674)|
| 3:14:35| I don't understand at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11675)|
| 3:14:37| I guess I don't completely understand why the funding for the state Supreme Court is not in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11677)|
| 3:14:44| and why we're here tonight to talk about the budget and we're going to get an amendment in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11684)|
| 3:14:51| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11693)|
| 3:14:56| This is our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11696)|
| 3:14:58| Oh, our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11698)|
| 3:14:59| The legislative budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11699)|
| 3:15:00| Yeah, the legislative budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11700)|
| 3:15:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11701)|
| 3:15:03| I just want to say, I mean, it's just nothing but the expense of the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11703)|
| 3:15:10| It's on page 15 of the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11710)|
| 3:15:14| I assume that we have budgeted for an overlap while we go about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11714)|
| 3:15:21| Well, not through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11721)|
| 3:15:25| I think we're going to be able to, in some discussions with the mayor, we'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11725)|
| 3:15:33| That will be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| The overlaps will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11735)|
| 3:15:39| I don't know exactly what the mechanism is to handle that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11739)|
| 3:15:43| I don't know if Jim may have any suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11743)|
| 3:15:46| or if we just need to have some further discussions with the mayor before we inform council how that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11746)|
| 3:15:54| One area on that page is that the dues for National League of Cities, Cindy says we no longer pay those out of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11754)|
| 3:16:01| So that needs to be striked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| I need to take that off the thumb drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11763)|
| 3:16:07| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11767)|
| 3:16:08| We'll work with council as you go through this transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11768)|
| 3:16:13| And as we get to there, part of this is going to figure out what that transition is going to cost and how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11773)|
| 3:16:21| So this is one where I prefer to work with some better numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11781)|
| 3:16:26| And, again, as we get closer to that time, then we'll be able to tie those down a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11786)|
| 3:16:34| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11795)|
| 3:16:38| We're all in the public here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11798)|
| 3:16:40| So Frost's salary and stuff, that's not where we started, whatever, three years ago, whenever we started that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11800)|
| 3:16:48| How does that get adjusted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| Is he on the city raise each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11810)|
| 3:16:55| That's the formula I've been using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11815)|
| 3:16:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| So you give him, he gets a two and a half percent raise each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11820)|
| 3:17:07| Is that what he got last year and that's what he got this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| And that's where you're disclosing that right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11830)|
| 3:17:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11833)|
| 3:17:14| It's been, honestly, there haven't been any discussions about anything this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11834)|
| 3:17:22| Is that number last year's number, I guess, is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11842)|
| 3:17:24| Or is that a different one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11844)|
| 3:17:27| I don't have Melissa's printout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11849)|
| 3:17:30| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| I just wonder what the calculation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| It's his current salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11854)|
| 3:17:35| I just put the current salary in there and for two years it had two and a half percent in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11855)|
| 3:17:41| So I don't know what the plan is this year until something lands on my desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11861)|
| 3:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11866)|
| 3:17:47| I just didn't know what the formula was and how we came about that and how we reviewed that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11867)|
| 3:17:51| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11871)|
| 3:17:52| Just consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| You know, two and a half seems to be the magic number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11874)|
| 3:17:57| And the thing that I don't want to do is, you know, go all these years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11877)|
| 3:18:01| and all of a sudden you have to have the big increase and, you know, it draws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11881)|
| 3:18:06| I just wanted to know what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11886)|
| 3:18:08| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11888)|
| 3:18:09| Fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11889)|
| 3:18:10| You put it down there, so I'm looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11890)|
| 3:18:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11892)|
| 3:18:19| There seems to be some scurrying over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| Page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11901)|
| 3:18:26| Has there been any consideration of a mileage stipend or anything like that for the travel the council does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11906)|
| 3:18:33| Well, I would need to speak with Jim about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11913)|
| 3:18:39| How about free parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| Well, I mean, you know, you throw that out there and I don't think that that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11921)|
| 3:18:47| I don't know that it's unreasonable, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11927)|
| 3:18:49| I mean, it costs us a lot of money to hold these seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11929)|
| 3:18:53| And, you know, we beg for them and we campaign and so we want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11933)|
| 3:18:57| And, you know, I think it's been since the 80s since we've had any increase in a stipend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11937)|
| 3:19:04| but yet, you know, we've had the parking and I don't think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11944)|
| 3:19:12| This is just me personally speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| I don't think that's reasonable no more than what we're down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11954)|
| 3:19:19| You know, to have to pay $40 unless it's going to $60, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11959)|
| 3:19:26| I think it's $45 a month, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11966)|
| 3:19:29| $45 a month, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| I mean, Jim, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11971)|
| 3:19:34| The, again, the parking has been scheduled to go to $60 and we have postponed it for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11974)|
| 3:19:42| I think it was scheduled to go to $60 about a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11982)|
| 3:19:46| And the county and the city have postponed that increase, you know, for at least twice that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11986)|
| 3:19:55| And we haven't had discussions this year as to where we're going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=11995)|
| 3:20:00| And my understanding is that council, you know, pays half of whatever they're going to write,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12000)|
| 3:20:06| so that might be about $23.75 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12006)|
| 3:20:11| Pay period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12011)|
| 3:20:12| Oh, it's $45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12012)|
| 3:20:14| $45 a month, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12014)|
| 3:20:15| Well, it's a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12015)|
| 3:20:17| I use it, and it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| You know, it's a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12019)|
| 3:20:20| I used to get a printout of their pay stubs, like advice on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12020)|
| 3:20:25| and I don't get those anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12025)|
| 3:20:26| They quit coming, so I don't really know unless somebody calls me and says there's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12026)|
| 3:20:32| So you're saying we're paying half of the rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12034)|
| 3:20:35| Yeah, that's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12035)|
| 3:20:37| I don't think that's all my pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12037)|
| 3:20:41| I pay zero, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12041)|
| 3:20:43| Well, there's two, I believe, that pay zero because they don't park here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12043)|
| 3:20:49| But I don't see it anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12049)|
| 3:20:52| so I'd have to see one of your deduct slips in order to tell you what's your advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12052)|
| 3:21:01| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12061)|
| 3:21:02| We don't pay the full $45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12062)|
| 3:21:03| You don't think they pay the full $45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12063)|
| 3:21:06| No, I believe that it's half of the going rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12066)|
| 3:21:09| So that would be what, if it's $45, $22.50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12069)|
| 3:21:14| It's more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12074)|
| 3:21:15| It's more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12075)|
| 3:21:16| I mean, I'll have to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12076)|
| 3:21:18| I thought the parking rate was $47.50, and you would pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12078)|
| 3:21:22| Per month or per pay period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12082)|
| 3:21:23| Per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12083)|
| 3:21:24| Per month or per pay period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12084)|
| 3:21:25| Well, could you check on that and let us know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| I will check on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12087)|
| 3:21:28| I mean, Councilman Del Vopi, to answer your question, since it's thrown out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| I mean, my thought on the, you know, an allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12092)|
| 3:21:38| we have a budget for travel, and it's very rarely ever, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12098)|
| 3:21:44| it's never since I've been vice mayor been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12104)|
| 3:21:48| I mean, there is some travel, but there's certainly not the amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12108)|
| 3:21:52| But I didn't know from an accounting standpoint if we wanted to do something like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12112)|
| 3:22:00| two fill-ups a month or something along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12120)|
| 3:22:03| and then you've got a receipt, you know, to back up what it is that you're doing for a gas allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12123)|
| 3:22:08| I mean, you asked me about a gas allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| I don't know how else you could, you know, there's got to be some kind of checks and balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12130)|
| 3:22:18| and I don't know how comfortable Jim would be, you know, with that type of a mechanism for backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12138)|
| 3:22:28| Wouldn't it be easier just to pay for parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12148)|
| 3:22:33| That's what we're here to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12153)|
| 3:22:37| The only reason I asked that was most of what we do is going to meetings in communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12157)|
| 3:22:42| looking at sites and, you know, meeting with a staff person about a problem there or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12162)|
| 3:22:47| And we come to meetings a couple times a month here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12167)|
| 3:22:51| but mostly we're out in the field driving around in our personal vehicles spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12171)|
| 3:22:57| It's doing the city's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12177)|
| 3:22:58| I mean, Councilor Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12178)|
| 3:23:00| Over the years, not anybody's request, just from serving on council and being out of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12180)|
| 3:23:07| this local elected legislative body receives the least amount of pay as well as, as far as I can tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12187)|
| 3:23:17| no supplements for mileage or home office expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12197)|
| 3:23:23| So this body's very, very frugal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12203)|
| 3:23:28| So I don't think, personally, I don't think it would be out of line to have something that was more in line with the other local elected bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12208)|
| 3:23:39| Do you know what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12219)|
| 3:23:41| Well, the county commission, their pay was essentially the same as ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12221)|
| 3:23:46| but there were some either office or mileage or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12226)|
| 3:23:50| They gave you a stipend above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12230)|
| 3:23:53| Yes, it was about $300 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12233)|
| 3:23:54| I think it's $300 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12234)|
| 3:23:57| In my opinion, given where we are right now, for this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12237)|
| 3:24:01| I would prefer just to leave this alone and deal with that in the coming year because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12241)|
| 3:24:07| this is something the mayor and Jim need to incorporate into whatever they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12247)|
| 3:24:12| This is not a hugely significant portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12252)|
| 3:24:17| Well, it's already budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12257)|
| 3:24:18| It's already in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12258)|
| 3:24:19| This is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| But what I'm saying is if we did, and I'm glad to let it go until next year, but there's $18,000 in there for travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12261)|
| 3:24:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12270)|
| 3:24:31| So it's already budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12271)|
| 3:24:32| It's just not used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12272)|
| 3:24:34| And that doesn't mean just because it's not used we have to use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12274)|
| 3:24:37| but that's one mechanism to do it and it not affect the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12277)|
| 3:24:41| Eighteen or eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| Eighteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12284)|
| 3:24:45| It's $2,000 per council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12285)|
| 3:24:49| Where am I looking that I'm not funding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12289)|
| 3:24:51| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12291)|
| 3:24:52| I'm on page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| Give everybody a raise of $1,000 and make it $21,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12294)|
| 3:24:58| That offset would be the easiest way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12298)|
| 3:25:01| I don't think you can do that without changing the charter or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12301)|
| 3:25:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12304)|
| 3:25:05| I don't know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12305)|
| 3:25:06| I know I'm talking about instead of raise, but I'm talking about an allowance for an actual cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12306)|
| 3:25:10| and whether it's documented mileage, which takes a lot of administrative time for not much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12310)|
| 3:25:15| whether it's like two fill-ups a month or whether it's, you know, some flat fee, $100, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12315)|
| 3:25:21| I think offsetting some of the costs of travel is not unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12321)|
| 3:25:25| And it shouldn't be excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12325)|
| 3:25:26| I don't think we want to stir anyone's ire about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12326)|
| 3:25:31| It's an out-of-pocket cost that we incur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12331)|
| 3:25:34| We do it because we want to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12334)|
| 3:25:37| In this budget that's proposed for you right now, it has airline, $4,000, transportation, other $4,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12337)|
| 3:25:47| and lodging, $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| So that's $12,000 that's in the proposed budget that you've got right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12349)|
| 3:25:56| That was the Joe Holquist fund, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12356)|
| 3:25:58| It's the page 21 that's referred to on the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12358)|
| 3:26:03| And it's kind of like the 202 money that what we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| I mean, it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12368)|
| 3:26:09| And if you want to use it, you can use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| And if you don't want to use it, you don't have to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12371)|
| 3:26:14| So if you wanted to maybe keep track of your miles and submit it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12374)|
| 3:26:21| I think that that's probably, it would be a nightmare for me to have to log it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12381)|
| 3:26:26| If we were to do it, and Jim, if you could kind of weigh in on, you know, a receipt type deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12386)|
| 3:26:35| that may be a little squirrely, something you may not be comfortable with, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12395)|
| 3:26:40| With the max, with the ceiling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12400)|
| 3:26:45| If we're talking, we have some provisions for out-of-town travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12405)|
| 3:26:52| We could come up with some procedures if we need to for in-town travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12412)|
| 3:26:57| Again, that's something that, again, we'd like to take a look at if that's something council would like to pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12417)|
| 3:27:04| and then let us see what we can work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12424)|
| 3:27:09| I was just throwing a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12429)|
| 3:27:10| I'm perfectly content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12430)|
| 3:27:12| Okay, so Cindy's saying to me that also registration fees is included in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12432)|
| 3:27:17| and miscellaneous registration fees, transportation, airline transportation, other lodging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12437)|
| 3:27:23| and all of that would be $4,000, $8,000, $12,000, $13,000, $14,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12443)|
| 3:27:29| And miscellaneous travel expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12449)|
| 3:27:34| Well, there's obviously money that could be used for a different expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12454)|
| 3:27:47| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12467)|
| 3:27:51| You want to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12473)|
| 3:27:54| At one time, a while back, before there was an increase in council salary by ordinance before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12474)|
| 3:28:00| and I don't remember exactly what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12480)|
| 3:28:02| I wish I had that file down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12482)|
| 3:28:04| But I believe at one time council had $400 a month for incidental experiences that they got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12484)|
| 3:28:10| But what happened was it was so cumbersome when you all did your taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12490)|
| 3:28:14| because you had to prove those expenses or pay taxes on that income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12494)|
| 3:28:20| That was back when Ed Schaus and there were a few others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12500)|
| 3:28:24| Is that your recollection too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12504)|
| 3:28:27| Again, this has been a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12509)|
| 3:28:30| I'm pretty sure it was $400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12510)|
| 3:28:31| There was, and I don't remember the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12511)|
| 3:28:34| There was a salary plus some sort of additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12514)|
| 3:28:39| Expense allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12519)|
| 3:28:42| And, again, it goes back a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12522)|
| 3:28:44| And then that was rolled into salaries and it just became harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12524)|
| 3:28:49| That way it was not an issue for tax preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12529)|
| 3:28:55| It made it a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12535)|
| 3:28:56| And that would still apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12536)|
| 3:28:59| It would be easier probably all the way around if you just had an increase in the pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12539)|
| 3:29:06| and reduce some of these other things that you all don't use in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12546)|
| 3:29:10| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12550)|
| 3:29:11| I don't know what I agree with you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| I recall reading, coming across a couple years ago, the last ordinance for the pay increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12553)|
| 3:29:18| and it did reference, like Jim and Melissa mentioned, that there was a monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12558)|
| 3:29:25| and because language was the cumbersome nature of it, they just transformed how it was structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12565)|
| 3:29:34| But I did a little Googling here and the source I found was about five years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12574)|
| 3:29:40| and it indicated that commission pay was $19,835 a year and $3,900 in travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12580)|
| 3:29:51| which would correspond to what Finbar was saying on the monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12591)|
| 3:29:55| And I believe by state law, commission and school board salaries are to be treated equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12595)|
| 3:30:04| We're not school board, so it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12604)|
| 3:30:19| Why don't Section 405 of the Charter says the salary of each council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12619)|
| 3:30:26| shall be as fixed by ordinance of said council but not less than $500 a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12626)|
| 3:30:32| and any change shall be effective the first day of the year following the next councilmanic election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12632)|
| 3:30:38| So I guess that's like the mayor's where it takes place January 1 or something, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12638)|
| 3:30:42| December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12642)|
| 3:30:43| Or December, whatever, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| This third Saturday, I think it is, in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12645)|
| 3:30:48| So we'd have to do it between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12648)|
| 3:30:51| By ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12651)|
| 3:30:52| If you did a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12652)|
| 3:30:53| Yeah, you could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12653)|
| 3:30:55| Even to do the expense allowance, you probably have to do an ordinance to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12655)|
| 3:30:59| I'll have to pull the ordinance where we had it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12659)|
| 3:31:03| And again, your attorney would probably want to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12663)|
| 3:31:06| My understanding is that you cannot raise any either salaries for the mayor or judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12666)|
| 3:31:14| or council member for existing members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12674)|
| 3:31:18| and it can only apply prospectively going to new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12678)|
| 3:31:23| And I'll give you the example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12683)|
| 3:31:26| There are four council members up for election this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12686)|
| 3:31:30| If you did it, and again, Rob may want to weigh in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12690)|
| 3:31:36| that if you did raise the salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| it could apply to the four new council members or existing council members coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12699)|
| 3:31:46| after the election in November, but it cannot apply to existing council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12706)|
| 3:31:52| Is that true of expenses, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12712)|
| 3:31:55| It's a different beast, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12715)|
| 3:31:57| I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| Again, what would happen is, again, there's another election in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12719)|
| 3:32:03| and then at that point they would all be hung up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12723)|
| 3:32:07| Lawyers do serve in bigger areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12727)|
| 3:32:10| No way, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12730)|
| 3:32:14| Mark will vote with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12734)|
| 3:32:16| I'm sorry I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12736)|
| 3:32:18| This is prolonging the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12738)|
| 3:32:25| We needed to burn up some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12745)|
| 3:32:28| I was going to say, this is as late as we've ever gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12748)|
| 3:32:32| The judge can rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12752)|
| 3:32:36| Vice Mayor, how about a 15-minute break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12756)|
| 3:32:41| 16 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12761)|
| 3:32:43| No, 15 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12763)|
| 3:32:44| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12764)|
| 3:32:45| Can we discuss about the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12765)|
| 3:32:47| Can we talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12767)|
| 3:32:49| Well, I think there's a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12769)|
| 3:32:51| We can go past 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12771)|
| 3:32:54| I'll withdraw my break request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12774)|
| 3:32:56| If Councilman Wallace would like to discuss the budget, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12776)|
| 3:33:01| Well, just a couple quick observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12781)|
| 3:33:05| Again, I brought these out during the day, and they're for consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12785)|
| 3:33:10| and I guess we'll learn more maybe on Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12790)|
| 3:33:13| But the funding for some type of parking garage for Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12793)|
| 3:33:16| this has been a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12796)|
| 3:33:18| It's a big deal for the merchants there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12798)|
| 3:33:19| and I think the timing is appropriate to have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12799)|
| 3:33:21| at least to have it in the budget as a placeholder and nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12801)|
| 3:33:24| Funding for the purchase of the State Supreme Court building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12804)|
| 3:33:26| the announcement's been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12806)|
| 3:33:27| We're going to bring it before Council to vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| and maybe we're going to see an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12810)|
| 3:33:32| I didn't know that, that we were going to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12812)|
| 3:33:36| I think that, you know, I think there ought to be some type of planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12816)|
| 3:33:41| and study for what we're going to do with Chilhowick Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12821)|
| 3:33:43| That's something that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12823)|
| 3:33:46| The other night we were out at the town, no, we were out at Alice Bell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12826)|
| 3:33:53| Alice Bell Spring Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| and it was talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12835)|
| 3:33:57| they talked about this from the East Town Business Association meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12837)|
| 3:34:03| that Nick's helped put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12843)|
| 3:34:04| about removing the trees in between the bridges along there to improve visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12844)|
| 3:34:11| At least some windows, we talked about clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12851)|
| 3:34:14| You know, there's two kinds of trees out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12854)|
| 3:34:16| There are specimen trees that need to stay there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12856)|
| 3:34:19| and Casey Krause could have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| There's a lot of scrub stuff, huckleberry junk that bird droppings create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12861)|
| 3:34:25| There's a lot of things that we can't do there very easily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12865)|
| 3:34:27| and one of those is reroute all those, reroute the entrance and exit ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12867)|
| 3:34:32| But that's a project right there that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12872)|
| 3:34:35| that could be done and pretty easily done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12875)|
| 3:34:37| and certainly budgeted for to improve the look of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12877)|
| 3:34:41| and that's something that they ought to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12881)|
| 3:34:43| It does concern me, nine plus million at Lake Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12883)|
| 3:34:48| I get the gym, and it's a great park, and I love the park, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12888)|
| 3:34:51| and I go there regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| but it's going to be an expensive office building, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12893)|
| 3:34:58| That's what you need to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12898)|
| 3:35:00| But all in all, I think it's a good budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12900)|
| 3:35:02| I'd like to see some dollars put in for economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12902)|
| 3:35:06| and what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12906)|
| 3:35:09| And Bob Wetzel touched on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12909)|
| 3:35:11| but it's going to be five years before that PSC metal site is going to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12911)|
| 3:35:16| I think one of what I heard from the Chamber and the Cirrus Airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12916)|
| 3:35:22| that announcement was that we were site ready out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12922)|
| 3:35:25| That site's ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12925)|
| 3:35:27| They could dig on it, and they're going to dig on it in June, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12927)|
| 3:35:30| I mean, it was site ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12930)|
| 3:35:32| It was ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12932)|
| 3:35:33| It's leveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12933)|
| 3:35:34| It was, and if we could do that inside the city of Knoxville somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12934)|
| 3:35:38| and work on that, again, I'd just like to see some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12938)|
| 3:35:42| We're throwing money at other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12942)|
| 3:35:44| You're saying acquire a land mass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12944)|
| 3:35:47| Well, you know, Bob talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12947)|
| 3:35:49| and I guess it's going to take five years to continue to put that PSC metals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12949)|
| 3:35:53| I guess it's so contaminated and all and a lot of other factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12953)|
| 3:35:56| but five years is a long time to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12956)|
| 3:36:00| I think that's a really good initiative to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12960)|
| 3:36:03| or have a 10-acre site that's available for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12963)|
| 3:36:08| Site ready stuff is really, really important to these businesses that want to move here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12968)|
| 3:36:13| And you heard Rhonda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12973)|
| 3:36:14| That's why I asked Rhonda that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12974)|
| 3:36:18| What's a limitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12978)|
| 3:36:19| Site ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12979)|
| 3:36:20| We've got to have stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12980)|
| 3:36:21| We've got to have availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| You can't forget that she had 57 in the queue that she's looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12983)|
| 3:36:27| They're looking at other cities, too, being site ready and what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12987)|
| 3:36:31| And we are very limited, as Jeff Welch talked briefly on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12991)|
| 3:36:36| But just a couple of comments I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12996)|
| 3:36:38| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12998)|
| 3:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=12999)|
| 3:36:40| Yeah, I found today to be, well, Brenda's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13000)|
| 3:36:45| She slipped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13005)|
| 3:36:46| Anyhow, listening to the mayor's budget hearings a month or a month and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13006)|
| 3:36:52| whenever it was, is always an eye opener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13012)|
| 3:36:55| Today has been, in my mind, a real showcase for the energy in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13015)|
| 3:37:01| I mean, I'm really impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13021)|
| 3:37:02| When you listen to it all in a concentrated form like we did today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13022)|
| 3:37:06| you really see the unbelievable activity going on, not just initiated by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13026)|
| 3:37:11| but partly initiated by the city and in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13031)|
| 3:37:15| It's just fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13035)|
| 3:37:16| So I've been delighted to see the activity going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13036)|
| 3:37:20| Could there be more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13040)|
| 3:37:21| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13041)|
| 3:37:22| But we've got a full plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13042)|
| 3:37:24| And I'm delighted with the activity I see and with the energy in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13044)|
| 3:37:29| So this is, I think we're headed in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13049)|
| 3:37:32| and I appreciate the administration putting this budget together, and I'm very comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13052)|
| 3:37:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| Well, some interesting comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13061)|
| 3:37:43| George raises the proposition of, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13063)|
| 3:37:47| should we be working with the chamber and more dollars to get a bigger land mass that's prepared and ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13067)|
| 3:37:54| Does that help us recruit a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13074)|
| 3:37:57| I guess I'm concerned that 10 acres might be small potatoes for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13077)|
| 3:38:02| a car industry supplier or something who needs to have kind of a big layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13082)|
| 3:38:08| But the idea, I think, is pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13088)|
| 3:38:11| They do some of that work now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13091)|
| 3:38:12| I don't know if, you know, what kind of money they have to acquire land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13092)|
| 3:38:18| I've heard Mike Edwards lament that they didn't get midway road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13098)|
| 3:38:22| but there were lots of local opposition to taking over that farmland and making it industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13102)|
| 3:38:27| and there were things like sinkholes and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13107)|
| 3:38:30| But I guess when you see what happens in places like Chattanooga, which is a lot flatter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13110)|
| 3:38:37| if an industry wants to come in and build something, they might have a bigger land mass than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13117)|
| 3:38:44| And I guess most of us have been to some chamber presentation where they sell that site-ready thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13124)|
| 3:38:50| That's certainly worthy of considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13130)|
| 3:38:52| I don't know how we go about it, whether the city does it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13132)|
| 3:38:55| whether they do it through the chamber or the economic development agency or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13135)|
| 3:38:59| but that's worth thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| In terms of things I've suggested in the past, I hope the mayor is considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13141)|
| 3:39:05| She's not here, but I hope she's considering the idea of let's have several departments that have the ability to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13145)|
| 3:39:13| For example, help us get, one, a sign on Cherry Street Interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13153)|
| 3:39:18| and route people to the Botanical Garden and Arboretum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13158)|
| 3:39:21| I think that's an asset and a jewel of East Knoxville that's not being fully utilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13161)|
| 3:39:28| and it wouldn't take much to plant some trees along that 1.6 mile to pick out a few blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13168)|
| 3:39:35| and get them acquired, cleaned up, resold, whatever, and maybe fix a sidewalk or two or a pothole or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13175)|
| 3:39:42| But I think we could troll cars of travelers and vacationers who want to do something interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13182)|
| 3:39:49| and that is a pretty neat thing, and people do it in the Carolinas and other places, bush gardens and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13189)|
| 3:39:56| It's kind of a treat to go to someplace like that, and those old stone walls are cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13196)|
| 3:40:00| So I hope we're thinking about doing stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13200)|
| 3:40:03| To me, that would come out of just sort of spare change operating funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13203)|
| 3:40:08| In other words, you might focus a little more on two or three blocks that are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13208)|
| 3:40:13| I hope we're thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| I don't think it requires a special budget line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13215)|
| 3:40:18| And then I guess I am impressed that we're trying to hold the line in terms of costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13218)|
| 3:40:24| and that this is not an overly ambitious budget in terms of new expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13224)|
| 3:40:30| so appreciative of that and all the work that went into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13230)|
| 3:40:35| With regard to Easttown, you know, we had two or three initiatives that we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13235)|
| 3:40:40| and this council actually prepared a resolution which we sent to the state, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13240)|
| 3:40:46| about looking into those interchanges, those two parallel access roads that are one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13246)|
| 3:40:53| the confusing crossover bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13253)|
| 3:40:55| Could there be a second chance exit if you finally realize as you drive through the somewhat clear trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13255)|
| 3:41:02| that there's a shopping center or a Lowe's or a Home Depot or a Cracker Barrel or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13262)|
| 3:41:07| that you can get off at the next stop, which is either Washington Pike if you're going north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13267)|
| 3:41:12| or Millertown if you're going south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13272)|
| 3:41:15| We have succeeded, I think, in convincing the state to let us have the logo signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13275)|
| 3:41:21| and that's going to help some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13281)|
| 3:41:22| But I think some clearing and whether that's something David Brace can, you know, pick up on a dull day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13282)|
| 3:41:28| He has offered if we wanted to get some volunteer labor to send a truck out or two to pick up some brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13288)|
| 3:41:35| if we clear it ourselves, and I know they did some clearing at the intersection of Millertown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13295)|
| 3:41:41| and the interstate, so that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13301)|
| 3:41:43| But I think that's an important thing to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13303)|
| 3:41:47| Here's a situation where we got 100 businesses that contribute mightily to property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13307)|
| 3:41:54| personal property tax, sales tax, and there are some infrastructure barriers that prevent them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13314)|
| 3:42:00| from being as successful as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13320)|
| 3:42:03| And I think government can do that, help remove barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13323)|
| 3:42:06| They can't run the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13326)|
| 3:42:07| Somebody with risk capital has got to go out there and do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13327)|
| 3:42:10| But, you know, but if they're hidden or hard to get to, there are things we can fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13330)|
| 3:42:15| that improve their chance of success in keeping jobs in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13335)|
| 3:42:19| But that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13339)|
| 3:42:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13341)|
| 3:42:22| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13342)|
| 3:42:23| Well, if we're talking about wish lists, I really would like to see something done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13343)|
| 3:42:29| in the area known as downtown Burlington, either public or private investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13349)|
| 3:42:36| a combination of both, because the area has really gone down over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13356)|
| 3:42:42| and there's really no investment going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13362)|
| 3:42:46| The Magnolia-Warhawk District, I think it will extend out that way over a period of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13366)|
| 3:42:52| but that's going to take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13372)|
| 3:42:55| So I would really like to see something done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13375)|
| 3:42:59| With the closing of Walgreens on Magnolia, that had a tremendous economic impact on that side of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13379)|
| 3:43:10| If you leave Gay Street, you're not going to find a pharmacy or really a health care facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13390)|
| 3:43:18| until you get all the way out to Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13398)|
| 3:43:20| That's a major problem that we really need to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13400)|
| 3:43:25| So I just want to make those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13405)|
| 3:43:28| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13408)|
| 3:43:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13409)|
| 3:43:30| I just want to echo what Finbar had to say about today was really, really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13410)|
| 3:43:34| in terms of realizing all that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13414)|
| 3:43:36| It's exciting to be a part of what's happening in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13416)|
| 3:43:39| But the other thing I want to do is I want to thank Melissa for the documents that she gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13419)|
| 3:43:44| It really does help go through and realize what it is, and you've made it very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13424)|
| 3:43:49| And I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13429)|
| 3:43:50| We appreciate what you've done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13430)|
| 3:43:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13434)|
| 3:43:58| Thank you, Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13438)|
| 3:43:59| I do have one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13439)|
| 3:44:01| You've got to train your assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13441)|
| 3:44:02| Our last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13442)|
| 3:44:03| You and Cindy both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13443)|
| 3:44:04| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13444)|
| 3:44:05| How many more are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13445)|
| 3:44:06| And thanks to Cindy for all the preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13446)|
| 3:44:09| Really, all the food and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13449)|
| 3:44:15| One comment on the site ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13455)|
| 3:44:19| Keep in mind the Industrial Development Board has many sites in Knox County, and periodically they do a tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13459)|
| 3:44:27| And I took that tour, I don't know, five or six months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13467)|
| 3:44:30| and it reminds you again of the sites that are ready for development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13470)|
| 3:44:36| We don't have a site for a Volkswagen plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13476)|
| 3:44:40| We just don't, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13480)|
| 3:44:41| But nevertheless, there are, and this is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13481)|
| 3:44:44| It may not be as much as we want or ultimately need, but the Chamber, they know about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13484)|
| 3:44:49| and certainly the Industrial Development Board does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13489)|
| 3:44:52| And that I-275 access road alongside 275 is going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13492)|
| 3:44:57| He's working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13497)|
| 3:44:58| The road that they're fixing, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13498)|
| 3:44:59| We're going to open up some old land that can be reused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13499)|
| 3:45:01| Good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13501)|
| 3:45:03| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13503)|
| 3:45:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13505)|
| 3:45:06| Hicks Plastic is located in the Mid-Park Industrial Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13506)|
| 3:45:11| They are a supplier of parts for Chevrolet products and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13511)|
| 3:45:16| It doesn't always take a huge piece of property for these suppliers to do their thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13516)|
| 3:45:25| And while Volkswagen has made a real impact on Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13525)|
| 3:45:29| Chattanooga also has a billion-dollar debt that our city doesn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| And so even though they're getting a lot of money from Volkswagen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13534)|
| 3:45:37| they've spent a lot of money to get a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13537)|
| 3:45:40| And I think that needs to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13540)|
| 3:45:42| But something like Hicks Plastic comes in and we do a pilot or a TIF, whatever, to get them going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13542)|
| 3:45:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13548)|
| 3:45:49| That's one of our tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13549)|
| 3:45:50| And they're going to keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13550)|
| 3:45:52| And we have other sites in the Mid-Park development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13552)|
| 3:45:56| We have some off of Industrial Heights Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13556)|
| 3:45:59| I'm not just speaking in the 3rd District because I kind of keep looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13559)|
| 3:46:04| A term comes up about locating a facility that I don't want located where they want to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13564)|
| 3:46:11| And it's not a manufacturing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13571)|
| 3:46:15| But we do have some sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13575)|
| 3:46:17| And it may be that we need to think in our own minds that you don't need thousands of acres of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13577)|
| 3:46:24| or hundreds of acres of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13584)|
| 3:46:25| We won't have them, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13585)|
| 3:46:26| And we don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13586)|
| 3:46:27| So we might as well think about what we do have and what will fit into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13587)|
| 3:46:31| And I think that the Chamber has greatly improved what it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13591)|
| 3:46:38| and what we get for the money that we give them over the time I've been on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13598)|
| 3:46:42| I was really unhappy the first two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13602)|
| 3:46:45| And maybe that was because the economy kind of slowed down too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13605)|
| 3:46:48| But I think that they're making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13608)|
| 3:46:51| They're reporting to us regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13611)|
| 3:46:53| And Innovation Valley is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13613)|
| 3:46:55| And as Finbar says, we need to think regionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13615)|
| 3:46:58| I mean, Knoxville is the place for the region, the hub of the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13618)|
| 3:47:02| But we need to think regionally in how we benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13622)|
| 3:47:05| Maybe it doesn't land in the city limits, but we do benefit from a lot of these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150521part2?start=13625)|
