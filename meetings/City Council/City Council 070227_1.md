| 1:08:04| The market for a condominium-style development generally produces fewer children than your typical house on a large lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4084)|
| 1:08:16| We would project that perhaps .2 children per housing unit going into the elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4096)|
| 1:08:28| Ten maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| The other question I got, and I don't want this to be sarcastic, although every time I say it in my head it comes out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| Number three below this, and this is an honest question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| We've just heard about all the density around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| The most dense anywhere near this is less than half the density of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| And yet on number three, your staff write-up says the proposed residential development is consistent in use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| and density with the zoning and community facilities in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| And I guess I just want to get sort of what, you know, how you do make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| and how much more density would have to happen for it to be inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4140)|
| 1:09:08| How do you all make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Because Mr. King, and I think the developer looked at this and said, you know, great, we're consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| How do you all make that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| We look at the surrounding zoning and the maximum development rights that would be generated from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| We've got a couple of RP1s at six units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| That's fairly comparable to the 7.9 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| We also look at good sustainable neighborhoods in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| and we see places like Sequoia Hills where there's a great variety of housing types in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| ranging from large houses on large lots to small houses on large lots to apartments and condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4185)|
| 1:09:53| So the density of a project is not necessarily the only criteria for compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4193)|
| 1:10:03| It would be the scale of the structures themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| and we have this particular project is made up of attached houses in combinations of twos and threes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| So they're not going to have structures that are going to overwhelm the scale of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| I think if you talk to a lot of planners, they will say that we need to learn to live on a smaller footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| Part of that is to learn to live with greater density, particularly within our urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4227)|
| 1:10:35| We have a growth policy plan that says we're to direct growth to the planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| and urban growth areas in a compact and contiguous manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| I think this project is compatible with that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| And if we look at housing 46 households in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| we need to consider whether we should put them on parcels that are less than 10 acres at greater densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| or to spread them out throughout the balance of the county in densities that are great or that are small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| So you decide what's consistent with the area depending on sort of philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| We also look at the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| We looked at the existing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| The one-year plan calls for a medium-density residential on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| The sector plan calls for a medium-density residential along that segment of Murray between this property and the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4288)|
| 1:11:37| It's compatible with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| Counsel Moroni.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| I guess I have two-part comments, first for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| If this council would support this appeal and basically repeat their action from a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4308)|
| 1:11:55| the action that Mr. Redman referenced, would this parcel ever come up to be down zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4315)|
| 1:12:04| or does that request have to come from the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| I guess in the second half of my comment is my struggle with this is that I feel like this parcel of property is inappropriately zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4327)|
| 1:12:16| When you look at the surrounding map and you see this RP1 drop down in the middle of agriculture and R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| although there is planned residential in other places, on that particular corner, it just feels like spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| And when you go back to the history here and look that it's been this way since 1973| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4350)|
| 1:12:37| and the designation for the, let's see, medium-density residential has been in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4357)|
| 1:12:45| the Knoxville one-year plan, since the plan started in 1982,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| it's difficult for me to say to the property owner, no, you can't do this with your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| I mean, the property owner has rights to develop their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| and there's a long history of this property holding this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| So if this council would turn this down, you know, at what point do we say this is spot zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| and the zoning needs to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| Well, you have that right at virtually any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| You as a council have the right to initiate general rezonings in addition to the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4394)|
| 1:13:21| Each year we do the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| and that requirement was put in the charter to give the council a list of general rezonings to be undertaken each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4403)|
| 1:13:36| I suspect that this property is probably in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| Previous councils have opted not to take those kinds of steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| and rely on the property owners themselves to initiate zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| And I have a follow-up question for Mr. Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| Following the controversy with this piece of property several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| did the Norwood Homeowners Association attempt to initiate via a council member a request for a rezoning on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4437)|
| 1:14:06| In 1990 and 1991, it was initiated by MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| Four major pieces of property in the Norwood area along Pleasant Ridge were changed to a zoning of lesser density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4453)|
| 1:14:24| That's a different way of saying downzoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| It was a huge, incredible property rights fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| The neighborhood supported MPC staff, and these were downzoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| Yes, this is obviously a spot-zoned piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| Do I want to make a declaration of war tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Of course not, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| I think we're just here to consider one thing, and that is, does this development, is it compatible with the surrounding area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| And really, Ms. Roddy, that has nothing to do with the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| If it were compatible at 20 units an acre, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| But in every possible way, this property is not compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| If you look at that first subdivision on Murray Road, it has sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| This development doesn't have sidewalks because everything is so crammed in, there's not room for sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| This is just too dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| It's not compatible with any of the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| If you'll notice on your map, just to the left, just to the west of this property, is a huge acreage that's zoned A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4521)|
| 1:15:30| Our homeowner's position for many years is we would not object to that property going residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| whether it's planned residential or single family or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| What do we tell that person if we approve the cabinet of realty development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| Do we say, well, you don't have a good lawyer like John King, so we're not going to let you do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| We're not going to let 150 units go in yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| We're just going to let 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| When we talk about zoning, we're setting a precedent every time we do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| And this is a precedent we really don't want to set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Ms. Peelum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Well, I think Mr. Redman, in a sense, has responded to one of my questions, my question and a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| But I do feel that one-year plan review is a very critical time for these issues to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4570)|
| 1:16:19| And I think it's a good time to consider this situation, which is a complicated situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4579)|
| 1:16:26| in terms of actually spot zoning is my sense of what has happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Seeing no other lights, are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| The motion is made in favor of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| And there was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| Okay, I have eight in favor and one against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| 10B is an appeal by Ann McIntyre for the Kingston Pikes Sequoia Hills Association of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| to approve a use on review request for a beauty salon as a home occupation subject to seven conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| in a low-density residential district property located on the northwest side of Kingston Pike, northwest of Tawanda Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4628)|
| 1:17:15| second district in conjunction with Resolution 11-0, which is a resolution approving the appeal of Ann McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4635)|
| 1:17:23| There are several people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| Those in favor of the appeal, I think I have this right, are John Brock and Arthur Seymour Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4645)|
| 1:17:32| Opposed to the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| Did I give it to you wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| And Kathy Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| You have it as opposed, but are you sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| We're in favor of the action of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| He's opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Kathy Sanders, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Is there anybody here, then, to speak in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| Ms. Mitchell made a mistake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| If anybody did, it was me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| This is the people in favor of the appeal by Ann McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| So that would be Mr. Seymour is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Arthur, who do you represent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| I represent Craig Barnett and Tracy Benson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| They were approved for a home occupation by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| So you oppose the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| So the neighborhood is here in favor of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| And the three of us who want to speak very briefly, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| But first we'll hear from those who are in favor, which I think, if I have this right, are Ruthie Coleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| Jim Blutner, and Ray Lacey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| And if I have mischaracterized one of you, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| But Jim and then Ruthie and then Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| That's correct, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| I'm Jim Blutner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| I'm here representing the Kingston Pikes and Quarry Hills Association and the Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4748)|
| 1:19:17| I've lost my train of thought on what our Bearden group is called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| Councilwoman Pelo, could you help me with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| Yes, the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| The Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| You have a lot on your mind tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| Well, it's, you know, we're not going to be here any longer than we have to, I assure you, from my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| Speak to it, Mr. Blutner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Go, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| First thing I'd like to say is that we do encourage this business to stay in Humberg Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| We encourage growth in Humberg Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| We've worked very hard for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| We also, if they feel like they need to move, would be glad to have them in our neighborhood commercial area in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| Quarry Hills next to Hamilton House and numerous apartments where they could do tons of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| So we are not against the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| We are just against the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| We emailed you a letter today that came from Nancy Benziger, who is a planner and a professor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| and thoughts that she had based on the conversations she had with the retired director of UT School of Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| and a former MPC member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Well, and this was the basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| I want to read a little, just a short part of this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| A beauty parlor should be very limited when it is a home occupation and residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| One chair, no outside employees and owner living in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| Okay, they have somewhat said they may do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| The incursion into a neighborhood is creeping commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| That is very likely to justify additional commercial uses in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| The situation is essentially de facto rezoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| So, in essence, that is one of the main concerns that we have is we have historically had the Montessori School as our buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4852)|
| 1:21:00| We know Kingsville Park is a very fragile area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| It has been assaulted on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| But over the years as we have been able to fight these battles and win those battles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| there has been quite a bit of development in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| And a lot of work has been done for people putting new houses, remodeled houses, spending a considerable amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4873)|
| 1:21:22| If you skip one house past this, the next three houses have all had a considerable amount of work done on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4882)|
| 1:21:29| Ray Lacy's house, the Killefer house there, the Coleman house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| And behind Sequoia Gardens, a nice development has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| So we are very concerned that this could erode their property values and that creeping commercialism could continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4898)|
| 1:21:47| Another main concern we have are the traffic implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| As you may know, this particular property was approved for use on review over 20 years ago in 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4911)|
| 1:21:58| As an association, we actually were in favor of this at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| There were several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| One, the house was well over 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| It needed to be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| It was going to the wrecking ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| So we saved it basically with use for a psychologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| Now, there has been some conversation about how many people did they use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| How many people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| They say they had two practicing psychologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| We have letters which are there for you from both of Mr. Dr. Droppelman's ex-wives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4940)|
| 1:22:29| And those are letters on the red sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| And both letters will tell you that Dr. Droppelman practiced by himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| There was no question about that, just so that you'll know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| What's changed during that time period, over 22 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| Well, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Western Plains has been expanded, been revitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| There's many more stores there, much more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Cherokee Gardens has gone in behind to add more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| Anttila has been fully developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| St. George's Church has had immense growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| and has just recently gone, in the last two years, for additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| A very active church, I might add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| All of these things have made the traffic in this area considerably worse than it was 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| I would like to call your attention to a sheet that we had the police department give us, a crash analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=4997)|
| 1:23:24| You will see that since 2002, and this is just a little one month over five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5004)|
| 1:23:31| there's been 312 accidents, one fatality, 47 crashes with injury, injuring 73 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5011)|
| 1:23:41| 264 property damage accidents with 695 vehicles involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| That's about close to 60 on a period of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| And those of us who live along the pike or have lived there will tell you that many accidents go unreported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| because simply they're very minor and the two people get out, settle it, and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| So this is, at a minimum, the number of accidents that occur there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| This is an undulating area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| It's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| One more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| We would like to talk about the concerns that MPC had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| Ray Lacey will address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Forest Glen, which comes out there west, is in the middle of a traffic calming study that's about completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| So there are definite areas there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| Ray Lacey will discuss some of the concerns that MPC had about traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| and some of the creeping commercialism problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| And Arusi Coleman will talk to you about the hairstylist situation and what we consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| You will see there we have given you information from a 45-year lady of 45 years' experience in styling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| that will tell you that the number of people that they have equipment for could handle three beauticians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| a stylist, and an assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| The restrictions that were placed on here are restricted to one person living in the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| and also no products can be sold in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| That's some of the restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| But yet they have admitted that they will sell products for various things that their customers will need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| So with this, I'd like to let Mr. Lacey speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5117)|
| 1:25:27| I'll try to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| Ray, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| My name is Raymond Lacey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| I live at 4243 Kingston Pike, which is two houses to the east of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5131)|
| 1:25:38| When I came to Knoxville in 1967 as a freshman at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| I can remember driving down Kingston Pike and seeing really grand homes along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| One of the houses that I distinctly remember seeing is the house that I presently own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| It was owned at that time by the owner of the White Stores, Mr. Dwight McDonald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| I've lived in Knoxville since pretty much all of my life, it seems like, but certainly since 1967,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| except for three years when I attended law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| I can remember driving down Kingston Pike over the years and seeing how things deteriorated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| Homes, basically, many of them just did not get repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| One of those houses I saw in disrepair is my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| which is now the oldest Barbara and McMurray house in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| I think council will remember the lengths to which the city went to preserve one old Barbara and McMurray house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5189)|
| 1:26:37| I have apparently the oldest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| But anyway, I saw that house and I had an opportunity to buy it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| and the property behind that and do some developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| And when I bought the house, I thought, you know, this is a great old house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| And being a history major in college, I wanted to preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| Folks, I've spent a lot of money on that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| As a matter of fact, my wife says I'm absolutely crazy for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| But I felt like I had an obligation to that old house once I bought it to make sure that nothing happened to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5225)|
| 1:27:11| And I will tell you, I think that my house, with the work that I've done on it, will be there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| What concerns me about this whole thing is that what's going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| Where does all this end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Am I to come back to you in two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| or maybe when I start to run, my practice starts to kind of wane a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5248)|
| 1:27:35| maybe I come back to you and say, look, I want a couple of my associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| and we want to move into my house and practice law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| I don't want to come before you and say, hey, I want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| because you've allowed somebody right down the street to put in two doors down, a hair salon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| and maybe next door to me, God forbid, a dog groomer or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| I don't care what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| I don't want any further commercial development along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| What that does is it pretty much erodes away, I think, one of the grandest parts of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| and that's what you see as you travel down Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| I want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| The fellow who bought the house next to me, and that house is in terrible shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| He bought it in terrible shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| There he is, Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| When he bought that house, I just breathed a sigh of relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| because I knew that no longer was I going to have to worry about the college kids jumping off the roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| and doing things on the roof and throwing beer bottles against the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| and doing wheelies in the yard and my having to call the police department a half a dozen times to get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5316)|
| 1:28:45| But, anyway, Tom wants to make that little house that's next door to me into a grand little house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| And, quite frankly, based on my conversations with him, he doesn't want to do that if he's going to be right next to a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| And so what's happening is we end up just basically stifling what I would think that all of you would want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| and that is a preservation of some of these grander old homes along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5343)|
| 1:29:10| That's what I have, but I do want to point out one last thing, and that is about MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| When I developed Sequoia Gardens, they basically said this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| Nope, no commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| I thought about putting some, maybe expanding the Western Plaza a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| No, couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| I thought, well, I'll put 80 units back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| I said, no, can't do that, too much traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| Well, what happens is as you go along, and I now recognize because I live there and I see the traffic every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5373)|
| 1:29:40| more traffic there is terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| Now, I will offer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| If anybody really wants to help us solve the problems about traffic along Kingston Pike, put in more red lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5385)|
| 1:29:51| and reduce the speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| But please do not allow any commercialization, any more commercial properties to be or properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5392)|
| 1:29:59| homes to be converted into basically businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| I think that's a bad, bad precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| Ruthie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Ruthie Coleman, 4205 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| First of all, I want all our neighbors to stand up that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| We handed you all also petitions, a total of 130 names that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| I think you all each have a copy of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| I live on the corner of Forest Glen and Kingston Pike, Forest Glen West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| It is a home that my husband's family has owned for 51 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| and Russell and I moved in it about eight or nine years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| I can't tell you how many wrecks have been in front of my home and in that stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| how many screeches I hear every day between Western Plaza and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| But the main thing I wanted to say is women go to hairstylists, and that's where we get all our gossip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5454)|
| 1:31:02| And today I heard gossip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| And so, therefore, I'm coming to you all to tell the gossip that I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| Apparently, the gentleman, Craig and his partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5469)|
| 1:31:16| Tracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| No, Craig Barnett and the other gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| Tracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Tracy Benson, who are doing this, will be living upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5482)|
| 1:31:28| Craig, along with Randy Bowles and Ray Gentry, will be the hairstylists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| and Tracy will be answering the phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| This was Randy Bowles' mother is telling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| So not only do we have them living there, which is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| and we have one hairstylist that is supposed to be doing the work, we will have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| Now that is against what they told MPC that would be going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| and that is what is going around in the circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| and that they will be selling their interior design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| They say that it won't be out of the home, but, you know, I pledge to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| if you agree to this, then you call every week, use a fake name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| and you go in there and have your hair done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| and you tell me that there's only one person doing hair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| I live four houses from this, and I am like Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| I have put a lot of money in my home since my in-laws died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| and in my yard, and it's going to go to waste if you all allow this to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| and I beg you not to let this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| because the next thing I know I'm going to have is a 7-Eleven next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| and I'll be getting my Diet Cokes every morning real easy at 6 in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| but that's not what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| I want to preserve my home and all the homes that we have going down Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| because that's all we have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| So by laws, we'll move to those speaking against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| John Brock and Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5588)|
| 1:33:16| Well, by our rules, we only allow three unless someone wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| I'll move to suspend the rules to give them a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| But if you would make that very brief, because your side already has taken the whole 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| if you'd just come speak very briefly, give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| I'm Thomas Brennan, Post Office Box 10324 Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| and I own the house next door to Ray Lacey and in between the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| It's in between the house that's in question for the rezoning at 4253.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| This house is not abandoned, as it's been proposed by some people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| and I do have a Fleener security hooked into the house to keep the homeless out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| while we're trying to decide what to do and which way to repair it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| This house was bought with the idea of restoration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| and it is a prime and beautiful example of a Gustav Stuckey design craftsman home of the 1920s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5646)|
| 1:34:14| Once finished, the house should be added to the other beautiful homes left in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| The encroachment of the beauty salon next door puts this house in a bad financial position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| as well as trying to restore it and puts it in question whether it should be restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5666)|
| 1:34:34| with all this commercialism that could creep into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| Is it worth doing this financially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| I'm asking the quest to be denied and the zoning to remain residential only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| And my hope rides with the council here that this house can be put back into a beautiful condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| and in the neighborhood the way it was years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| and a prime example for people going up and down Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| And I appreciate the minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| Three of us wanted to speak, and I will get straight to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| I am here on behalf of Mr. Benson and Mr. Barnett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| and they seek to do what the other speakers have said they want for Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5722)|
| 1:35:30| They want to maintain it as a prime residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| The house we're discussing here is a problem house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| It has not been owner-occupied for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| Today and within the past year and even more back in time than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| this house could serve as a set for a remake of that classic movie, Animal House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| Go down there any weekend, you have the extras on site, and start filming away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5760)|
| 1:36:09| My clients want to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| The house has become dilapidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| Subject to obtaining approval of this home occupation, they would close on the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5775)|
| 1:36:22| They do not own it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| They would buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| They would restore it and help stabilize this end of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| They would reestablish it as an owner-occupied house, which it has not been for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5792)|
| 1:36:40| Unless this home occupation is approved, they will not be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5800)|
| 1:36:48| Sequoia Hills Homeowners Association says that it opposes this because of creeping commercialism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| This is not a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| The home will remain zoned R1, and there is certainly no intention of changing any of the zoning along that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5817)|
| 1:37:07| The area can once again become stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| If Mr. Brandon would do his house and my clients could do their house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| this would return to a stable anchor for the west end of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| Home occupations are much more prevalent than you are aware of in the city, I suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5845)|
| 1:37:32| In fact, if you look at the business licenses issued or posted in the newspaper on Sunday, 90 percent of them list property that is residentially zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5852)|
| 1:37:43| It is only when somebody comes forward with a request like this that they run into trouble or when a neighbor reports them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5863)|
| 1:37:52| My clients came forward up front asking, telling everybody what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5872)|
| 1:38:00| If city council would be inclined to grant this approval, the city ordinance, the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5880)|
| 1:38:08| allows you all to place any number of conditions on their use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| One, well, the ordinance itself says there can be no more than one nonresident working on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| You can limit the duration of the home occupation there to their ownership of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| They have agreed no signs other than the number on the mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| You can put any number of conditions like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| And I've offered that to Mr. Blattner but have run into a blank wall on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| So it comes down to an issue of are you going to grant the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| This house will probably return to a rental if the appeal is not granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5925)|
| 1:38:53| My clients intend to go forward and purchase the home and use it as their residence, their only residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5933)|
| 1:39:00| and operate a business in the home without any indices that a business is going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5940)|
| 1:39:07| Finally, I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Brock next, but I want to point out some deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| This matter has been appealed from MPC by Mrs. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5953)|
| 1:39:22| The appeal is not here properly before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| Article 7, Section 6, Subsection F of the City Zoning Ordinance states how an appeal is taken from the action of MPC to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5966)|
| 1:39:40| It's by filing a petition with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| There are four particulars required in that petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| Three of them are not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| There has only been compliance with one, and this is not a may provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| The ordinance says such a petition shall be in writing and shall state with particularity the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=5994)|
| 1:40:03| One, the name of the owner of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| This petition does not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| B, a description of the subject property, including the city block and parcel or lot number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| This petition does not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| C, a statement of the petitioner's interest in the matter, including a description of affected property owned by a petitioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6016)|
| 1:40:24| where a petitioner is not the owner of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| That is not included in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| For those reasons, we submit this council has no jurisdiction to hear this appeal tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| Mr. Brock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| I'm John Brock, 7412 Bellingham Drive, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| I'm a real estate broker, and I'm the one who's facilitating this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| I brought together seller and buyer to the table with this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| The seller contacted me after owning this property for a few years and renting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| and feeling like her renters were turning out to be only college students who were sending the property backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| Frank got a little bit more than she could handle and asked me if I could help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| and I put my head to the ground and came up with the thoughts that maybe the applicants who are before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6069)|
| 1:41:16| might be just the type of business and residence use that could bring this property to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| as one stepping forward instead of backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6082)|
| 1:41:26| This house is one of two Victorian houses remaining on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| The Matheny House behind the serpentine wall and this yellow farmhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| which when it was built was far out in the country and long before Sequoia Hills was constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| So it sat there by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| It was a private home until Dr. Dropelman bought it in the mid-'80s and did a great thing for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| On one hand, he infused some money in it that gave it mechanical strength and kept it around until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| On the other hand, he modified it in such a way that it's no longer a candidate for a standard residential unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| And as is the case so often when we have to go backwards and try to lay covenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| and restrictions and regulations on a neighborhood that's never had them, there's always community angst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| And I sympathize to a great degree with the opponents because I, too, live in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| but I've passed this house every day and I've watched it go down in the shadow of the Coughlin House going away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| not too many miles away from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| This is a historic property, not registered but entitled to registration, that is stepping backwards quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6143)|
| 1:42:30| And it is not a candidate for residential use because clotting has happened, as I call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| Age and condition and price have all come together to a point where value is affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| And unfortunately, our opponents have not addressed value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| This property is not worth to a residential homeowner what it is worth for a use like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6167)|
| 1:42:54| And to reemphasize some things, it is to be first and foremost the home of these applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6174)|
| 1:42:59| with only 23 percent of the space used for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| I'm not here to spread gossip, as some others were purporting to do earlier, but I will tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| It is the intent of the applicant, as reflected in their application, to downsize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| They are getting older. They want their business to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| And this is not an application for perpetual use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| If it were, Dr. Droppelman's approval from years ago would keep us from being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| He had an in-home business. It was rented after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| We're back before you with the application for an in-home business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| The next person, if there is another one, next owner, if he proposes a 7-Eleven or some other use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| would have to be back before you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| This is an in-home business, and I'm told that I should say there is a difference between a beauty salon and a hair salon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6222)|
| 1:43:49| the latter being a smaller and more limited service offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| All these things said and done, I reach for straws with great passion and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6235)|
| 1:44:02| tomorrow morning, if this does not gain your approval, there will be a for rent sign in the yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6242)|
| 1:44:09| and by the weekend, no doubt, there will be college students back in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| because my seller tells me it was her hope when investing in it that maybe she might live in it someday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| and when that was ruled out, she hoped maybe Ken, Barbie, and their two daughters would move in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| and this house does not attract families, much to her chagrin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| It seemingly attracts only college students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| It's great for that, too, because right now it's a two-bedroom house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| Four people can live there, and it's got a bunk room upstairs with four beds in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| and ten of their drunken friends can stay over, so there's always a mass, I generalize laughingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| but there's always a mass of cars and unwanted activity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| No rental project could ever bring a great appreciation to any neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| particularly this one on Knoxville Signature Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| We had one more speaker from the Montessori School, if we may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6294)|
| 1:45:02| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| My name is Kathy Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| I live at 929 Marble Road here in Knoxville, and first I want to apologize for the uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6304)|
| 1:45:11| I'm the Knox County Fire Marshal, but I'm here purely as a private citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| I'm here as president of the Knoxville Montessori School Board of Trustees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| and I didn't have time to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| I want to introduce very briefly some board members and staff that are here from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| Jeannie Olbert, co-owner of Olbert Printing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| Lela Young, former employment lawyer, current secretary of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| and I might add a current Sequoia Hills homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| Jan Goddard, our director and administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| And Kerry Mullendick, our assistant director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| I think most of the people before me have covered the history fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| A little bit of history for KMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| We've been in operation since 1966.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| We've been at this current location since 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| We've built a primary wing in the 80s, and we added on again in 2002 for the elementary class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6358)|
| 1:46:05| But through all these changes, KMS has been careful to maintain the original appearance of the front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| We understand the importance of the authenticity of the KMS facade to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| and to the beauty of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| We see ourselves as kind of a bulwark against the commercialism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| the outright commercialism of Western Plaza and further west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| As other people have mentioned, Dr. Dropelman lived next to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| He loved that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| We remember very well the care he put into it and the appearance and the interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6395)|
| 1:46:40| He not only lived there, he operated the business, a home business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| and he did remodel it extensively so that the main floor is only waiting rooms, exam rooms, bathrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6403)|
| 1:46:51| and it's the second floor that's a living space with kitchen, dining room, bath, bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| Dr. Dropelman was a great neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| Since he lived on site, he looked after the school after hours and on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| And as he got older, we helped him out, helping with branches down and cleaning out our common fences, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6424)|
| 1:47:11| And the traffic from his patients was a total non-issue from the school's point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| We appreciated having an owner-occupied home business next to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6436)|
| 1:47:22| Then about five years ago, the business was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| I mean, the property was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| Another business operated for a little while, an art school for children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| which dovetails nicely with the KMS mission, but that didn't last long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| Since then, it's been a rental house, and other people have talked to that, but we lived through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6453)|
| 1:47:40| There's been a progression of male students, college students living in that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| They throw parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| They shoot off fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| Kathy, pardon me for interrupting, but let me add something here, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| The last time this property sold took two years and ten months to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| It went through the hands of seven real estate agents and thousands of dollars in marketing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| Two years and ten months to sell that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| So we've had to deal with people throwing parties over there, shooting off fireworks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| dumping the empty fireworks in our parking lot, people driving through the yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| both theirs and ours, hopping the fence after hours and playing on our monkey bars and swings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| leaving articles of clothing on our playground, breaking beer bottles in the parking area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| running naked through the yard, and throwing garbage and rotten food into the playground area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| A quick review of the photos you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Some of those are the beer bottles and the rotten eggs that have been thrown around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6514)|
| 1:48:41| plastic bottles, leaking dressings, shattered glass up against classroom doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| This is the stuff that we've been living with for the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| And the last pages are a partial journal, very brief, from the administrator's notes, board meetings, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| and I've highlighted a few of the items that I've already mentioned that we've had to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| For us, this is clearly an issue of the KMS children's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| Children we're responsible for while they're attending the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| The other people who spoke against this petition, or in favor of it, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6552)|
| 1:49:20| they can't speak to the health and safety of the children like we can, and we've been having to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6560)|
| 1:49:27| In fact, if you want a close-up opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| actually the Sequoia Hills Neighborhood Association president is a former parent from our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| His children attended, and part of the time he was part of our school was during these rental years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| And I guess I'd have to ask anybody, especially him, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| are the health and safety of the children compromised more by fashion-minded professionals who want their hair styled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| or by broken glass in the parking area, rotten food and thrown into the playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| underwear and other soil clothing in the playground areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| So in conclusion, you know, I thought about getting up here and talking about zoning issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| and highest and best use and, you know, what an owner-occupied home business would mean to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6605)|
| 1:50:13| But in the end, I just want to say that while, you know, I don't know that this will pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6613)|
| 1:50:19| I understand the nature and power of neighborhood associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| I live in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| And in another life, I worked as an attorney for a nine-member city council, much like this, though in a smaller city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6624)|
| 1:50:31| So I know what's against us in supporting this petition, or supporting the MPC decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6631)|
| 1:50:38| But, you know, what is at stake here is trying to improve the health and safety conditions of children in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6638)|
| 1:50:49| And if you strike down the MPC's decision, we will continue to deal with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| the overgrown weeds in the yard and broken beer bottles and naked men running through at dismissal time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| and whatever else we have thrown at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| But you have the opportunity to address a real health and safety risk to the children who attend KMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| And by supporting the MPC's decision on this issue, and I'm asking you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6670)|
| 1:51:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| Mr. Blattner, you have two minutes if anyone would like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6679)|
| 1:51:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| I'd like to make a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| First of all, we agree with Montessori School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| We're not happy with what's been going on there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| We filed a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| You'll see we have a copy of a complaint where they actually had seven people living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| They have five beds upstairs, not four, and two bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| They had seven people, although five on the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| It's $3,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| Nice rent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| Okay, who are you going to get to rent that other than a bunch of college students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| And you're not going to be able to do it any longer under the new definition of family that we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| because most they could have would probably be three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| So that's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| The game has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| You know, they talk about it not being able to be used because of the particular situation that it's in with the kitchen upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6722)|
| 1:52:10| I might point out that in August of 2004, this house was purchased for $291,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| and you have the property card there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| It's currently under contract for $499,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| Not bad for 30 months holding a piece of property and not doing a darn thing to improve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| other than having a bunch of students there that are causing everybody problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Maybe she'd take some of that money that she's going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| and take the kitchen and move it downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| She'd still, let's just say she spends $100,000, she's still going to make $100,000 on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6755)|
| 1:52:41| So, you know, if she can't sell it, maybe she needs to make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| Or maybe she made a bad business deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| We can't protect everybody for bad business deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| And so I guess the other point that I'd like to make is that while we're talking about the Montessori School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6771)|
| 1:53:00| I think one of the things that they pointed out to you that I forgot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| they've had two expansions with that school since Mr. Droppelman went in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| Do you think that's increased the traffic in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| You know it's increased the traffic in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Has it increased the people who we want to be least at risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| Sure it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| Fifteen more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| In conclusion, I ask that you uphold our appeal and vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6801)|
| 1:53:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| We don't need a beauty parlor on Kingston Pike that close where all the traffic problems are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| Councilman Bailey, I think you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| Mayor, I wanted to ask Mr. Swanson if we have the right to hear this appeal tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| First of all, I know you heard Mr. Seymour's complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| Yes, I heard Mr. Seymour's complaints and I've heard them in the past with regard to the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| And he's exactly right about what the code says about what is required in terms of information on an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6828)|
| 1:53:55| Unfortunately, the appeal form that is provided in MPC does not contain that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| and so the person who is filling out the appeal form is not required there on that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| What I would say to you is that if I think this is something that can be cured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| and if Mr. Seymour feels like he's prejudiced by not having that information in the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| I would suggest that you offer to him a two-week postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| during which the appeal form can be amended to include that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| if he feels like he needs that information in order to proceed with his case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| I don't want to jump out of line here real quick, but before I lose this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| why do we, if this has been a problem in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| why do we still have a form that doesn't address this and is not adequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| Why have we not addressed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| And that predates you, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| but can anybody who predates Mr. Donaldson in MPC explain why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| if this has been an issue that's come up before, that nobody has amended a form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| Dave Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| Yeah, who was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6896)|
| 1:54:57| Dave Hill was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| This is Dave Hill's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| Mark, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| I think it predates Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| This is the first I've heard of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| I wasn't aware that there was a problem with the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| Let me make a recommendation that somebody put their heads together and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| That doesn't make much sense to me that we've got that issue out there like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| I think it's in Mr. Hill's defense and the current director's defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| that this issue has come up years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| and not during the current administration or the immediately previous administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6924)|
| 1:55:30| And I'm going to mention it predated both you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| I recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Mr. Bailey, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| Mr. Seymour, would you like to answer Mr. Swanson's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| Well, we both read the same ordinance and we read it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| I would respectfully disagree with Mr. Swanson that this can be cured after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| The appeal must be taken within 15 days of the action of the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| which I think was January 11th, was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| The appeal was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6958)|
| 1:55:59| but there's nothing in there that says it can't be amended to include additional information as may be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| Well, I would respectfully submit that it must be properly filed at the time within 15 days of the MPC action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6964)|
| 1:56:13| Now you've found an area where we will agree to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| Yes, and that it cannot be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| It is procedurally defective, substantively defective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| if it's not properly prepared within the 15 days of the action of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| Mr. Swanson and I disagree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| He's your lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| I'm the applicant's lawyer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| So I don't see the need for a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| I just submit that the appeal is not properly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| Well, I think we need to ask you whether you feel that you've been prejudiced by the lack of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| And if you have, we can probably supply the missing information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| So we need to ask you whether you want us to supply that missing information by giving a two-week postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7017)|
| 1:57:04| during which you will be provided with the information so that you will not be prejudiced in dealing with this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| We wouldn't want you to be prejudiced by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| It's not a matter of prejudice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| It's a matter of jurisdiction, the same as an appeal from a law court to a higher law court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7033)|
| 1:57:20| If it's not done properly within the period of time following the action of, say, the Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7040)|
| 1:57:27| or the Chantry Court or the Circuit Court, the appeal cannot be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| I would disagree with that and suggest to you that I believe the court, when we get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| will say that this can be cured if you want it to be cured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| and we'll be happy to provide an opportunity for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| Nelson Bailey, go ahead if you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| Should we proceed or postpone or what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| Because I can tell you these aren't much fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| I'd leave that up to Mr. Seymour and let him decide if he wants you to provide that information to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7073)|
| 1:58:02| Counselor Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| No, I want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| We're here raising a jurisdictional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| This appeal was not properly filed within the 15 days required by the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| and the manner required by the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| So we respectfully submit there's no jurisdiction here in the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| So you don't want to postpone that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| That's entirely within the discretion of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| All right, I'd like to go ahead, because I know we've got a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| that have come out from the community on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| And, you know, we've had these use-on-review home occupation appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| and issues before, and they've been contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| And it's not a lot of fun because, first of all, Mr. Brock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| I commend you on bringing the buyer-seller together because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| your concept's very positive, and I think, you know, that would work out very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| And, you know, the property, the house, and so forth seem to fit well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| And it's, you know, the Sequoia Hills, Kingston, Pike area's been mixed and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| But, you know, I also see the positives, but I also see the negatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| which is, in this case, you know, a very successful business in the Homburg community down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7148)|
| 1:59:14| which we've all been hopeful and, you know, very excited about its success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| And you have a very successful business down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| And, you know, I've heard from a lot of your clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| people I go to church with, you know, love the job you do, and they've, you know, asked me to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7166)|
| 1:59:32| And then I've, you know, but I just look at Kingston, Pike as I see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| and I think, you know, neighborhoods are neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| and businesses ought to be in commercial districts, and you have to draw the line somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| And, unfortunately, I think this is where you draw the line because there's a lot of similar pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7186)|
| 1:59:52| up and down Kingston, Pike, and I can just see what, I guess, the commercial creep continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7192)|
| 1:59:59| And so, you know, as I want to remain consistent in my view of these home occupations, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| businesses ought to be in commercial districts and neighborhoods should remain neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| And so I'm going to support this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| I'm going to go to Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| Actually, maybe Councilwoman Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| I think your light was on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Well, Councilman Frost, I think, was nice enough to let me go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| However, I had wanted to respond directly to Mrs. Saunders, and I believe it's Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| And that didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| This is my fifth year sitting on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7231)|
| 2:00:35| I am your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| I live a couple of blocks from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| I represent the district that the Montessori School sits in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| I have never had the first phone call about any of the concerns or problems that you have there with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7243)|
| 2:00:51| And listening to you account all of the situations there, I certainly sit here feeling embarrassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7251)|
| 2:00:58| and remiss that I have not been involved in assisting you to find some way to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7258)|
| 2:01:06| So I'm offering you my services because that is why I sit on this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7266)|
| 2:01:12| and that is why I represent the district in which your school is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| Now, I'm not going to repeat the comments Mr. Bailey made, but I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7277)|
| 2:01:25| We had a wonderful visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| I really appreciate Mr. Brock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| I really appreciate both of you gentlemen for inviting me to the property because, frankly, I had never been in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7289)|
| 2:01:36| So it was of great benefit to me to see the circumstance there and to see really what your dream is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7296)|
| 2:01:42| And it's just unfortunate that it's located where it is because I think your concept there would be a wonderful one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7302)|
| 2:01:52| But I have to concur with Mr. Bailey that it's just in the wrong place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| and I just simply cannot support anything that encroaches further on the residential area along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7317)|
| 2:02:08| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| Ms. Saunders, may I ask you a question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| Let me boil it down to one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| Isn't the problem with the current property owner and you figure there's nowhere to go but up with change of ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7337)|
| 2:02:28| Basically, I believe that it will turn into a rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| You know, given the layout of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| I just don't believe that it's going to be purchased by a single family who will want to spend the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7357)|
| 2:02:44| to completely redo the entire inside of it to make it into a livable property again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| It's been on the market, as Mr. Brock said, for years before it was purchased this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| And during that time it was a rental and we dealt with the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| And I just don't see that it's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7380)|
| 2:03:06| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| I just want to let me give a for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| I mean, I grew up in Sequoia Hills, drove by that house, admired that house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| bought a house very similar to that house, actually, in Fourth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| actually had a beauty shop in the basement, one-time Dorinda's Beauty Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| I met with the applicants early this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| And, you know, it's a fine endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| Unfortunately, I'm not in the need to need a hairdresser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| But, yeah, I'm concerned with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| But, you know, the house I had had three kitchens in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7419)|
| 2:03:43| A kitchen can certainly be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| As I told these two fine gentlemen this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| my house tore out and hauled off over 30 tons of plaster, lath, and sheetrock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| Work can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| I mean, actually, this is something that I could see myself owning someday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7436)|
| 2:04:00| knowing exactly what I know about it, how it's laid out right now, not at this price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7440)|
| 2:04:08| But it is something that's worthy of consideration by the property owner of putting in the right tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7448)|
| 2:04:16| of putting in tenants that are respectful of their neighbors and their surroundings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| The previous exchange of Mr. Seymour and Mr. Swanson, I think it's clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| that the record should reflect that Mr. Seymour's objections to the appeal form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7472)|
| 2:04:40| and its apparent failure to fulfill the requirements of the ordinance, as Mr. Swanson put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7480)|
| 2:04:47| and it was essentially offered to Mr. Seymour, there is a remedy or a cure for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| And it is evident that Mr. Seymour is not interested in pursuing that cure, so I don't think that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7491)|
| 2:04:59| In terms of the support, and I understand the position that the Montessori school is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| and feel for them in that situation, I represent the Fort Sanders neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7506)|
| 2:05:13| And in terms of problems with students, college students, we see a tremendous amount of that there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7513)|
| 2:05:20| and much of that behavior is totally inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| But I go back to what Councilman Pelos said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| I think that, and also what Mr. Blattner said earlier, that with the change in our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7528)|
| 2:05:35| and zoning ordinances and the definition of family, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| and the ability we have to enforce those, at least in theory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7539)|
| 2:05:44| and certainly with the support of the district council member, I think there may be a remedy other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7544)|
| 2:05:50| And the key question here is, is there another remedy other than what some people are calling a de facto rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7550)|
| 2:05:57| Because of the scale of the commercial application that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| So given the balance of things, while I can see concerns on both sides, I would find it very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7562)|
| 2:06:10| and, in fact, don't see how I can support the use on review, and, therefore, I'm going to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7570)|
| 2:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| Seeing no further lights, are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| Vice Mayor Brown, go ahead first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7584)|
| 2:06:25| Just very quickly, you know, I sit here for a second and struggle with whether or not to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7585)|
| 2:06:30| because it seems like sometimes we feel as council members we've got to always say why we vote in a certain way sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| And I felt that maybe this time, because I've got a feeling I'm going to be on the other side of this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7595)|
| 2:06:41| this feels a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| I've voted, I guess, pretty much most of these kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| but there's something here that after looking at the application, hearing what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| that I think that I'm probably going to be in the minority here and actually not support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7610)|
| 2:06:56| I think this may actually be the best thing in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| The zoning is not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| We've got a lot of issues that have been put out here that are really kind of landing home to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| for some of the things that are being said on the other side with regards to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| And sometimes you've got to just sit back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| So without just people hearing it and not hearing me say why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| basically after listening to the arguments, you know, and reading what I see here, I can't support the appeal on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7636)|
| 2:07:22| I think that this may be the best thing with this property in a long home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| And I don't see commercial creeping on Kingston Pike, realistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| Let's be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7651)|
| 2:07:32| How many of those big houses are people going to buy and put a Wendy's in or a 7-Eleven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| I don't personally see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| My personal opinion, I don't want to get into a debate with a whole bunch of folk about my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| I don't see that because these guys may take a building that's run down and improve a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| and improve a situation for the school next door, deal with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| When I look at the issue of jeopardizing safety, if you've already got it as a rental property with folk staying up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7671)|
| 2:07:57| and having parties and cars pulling out in the middle of the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| they're still going to be there if it's a rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| It may be more so worse than what these guys are going to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| So when I look at some of these reasons for appeal, they don't sit home with me on this one as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7684)|
| 2:08:10| I tend to go against these kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| But in this situation, I think that maybe I'm going to be in the minority on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| Mr. Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| Councilman Brown, I was tempted to head in that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| because this project does seem to resolve some of the concerns of the school and also improving the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7702)|
| 2:08:30| And I want to thank Mr. Benson for taking me through the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| And I'm convinced that you would do an outstanding job of restoring that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7714)|
| 2:08:39| But it feels a little bit like doing the right thing the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7719)|
| 2:08:45| You have Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7725)|
| 2:08:51| You're offering your support in helping to, I don't know what kind of support you're offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7731)|
| 2:08:58| I would like to also offer my support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| I've talked to Mr. Blattner about mobilizing an effort to not just tell the community what you don't want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7741)|
| 2:09:10| but what you do want with some of the ordinance changes that we no longer can have 10 people in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7750)|
| 2:09:18| There's clearly a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| We have blight in Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| But I'm going to support the appeal because I feel like it's doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7766)|
| 2:09:35| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7775)|
| 2:09:36| I certainly do not want to take our vice mayor on in a debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| I'm definitely not up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| However, I do feel that I need to comment in regard to your comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| that you can't see this crouching commercialism in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| And I have to tell you, in the few years I have sat on Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7794)|
| 2:09:59| there are two other properties where I have been approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| They are immediately in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| One is almost immediately across the street and another just a bit away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| And so that approach has already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| That consideration has already been brought to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| And, you know, I feel a big concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7816)|
| 2:10:21| And that is one thing that weighs heavily on me when I consider how this property might go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7821)|
| 2:10:29| Because I think if this property goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| so we would have no reason to oppose any other business that wanted to move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7831)|
| 2:10:38| Would anyone like to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| Right now there's none on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| I move that we uphold the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| There's a motion and a second to uphold the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| I heard Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| 10C is an appeal by Dennis Weaver of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| to deny his request to rezone property located on the southwest side of Maloney Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7868)|
| 2:11:13| northwest of Ginn Drive, from A1 General Agricultural District to RP1 Planned Residential District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7873)|
| 2:11:18| Dennis and Jana Weaver applicants, that is first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7878)|
| 2:11:22| and it's to be considered with 12D in ordinance to rezone the property from A1 to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7882)|
| 2:11:30| There is, I think, Mr. King, you're signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7890)|
| 2:11:36| I don't have anybody here signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| Is there anyone here to speak in favor of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7901)|
| 2:11:44| Sir, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| Dennis Weaver, 1849 Kelton Lane Merrillville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7906)|
| 2:11:56| A little lost for words because I don't normally do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| Since I bought the property a little over four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| we put over $8 million into it to improve the old Maxie Boat Dock property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7925)|
| 2:12:11| I bought the land from the heirs of the Maxie Estate after they died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7931)|
| 2:12:20| I bought it from the two sisters and brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| We bought the land in front of them as well, and starting in November, December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| I've been trying to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| The people that I've been talking with asked me to submit the rezoning and the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7954)|
| 2:12:42| which I did at their request in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| They asked me to postpone it until February, and then again from February to March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| When I went down to postpone it to the February meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| I found out that part of this property had already been part of the two documents I filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7975)|
| 2:13:02| that had already been heard, and that was the zoning of the A1 to RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7982)|
| 2:13:12| They had later asked me to go ahead and remove the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| They were looking at a way to make the property more profitable in order to sell it, for them to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=7997)|
| 2:13:26| I spoke with Mr. Kelly today and removed the concept plan off the agenda on January the 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8006)|
| 2:13:35| when I was not there at the meeting because I thought I had filed continuance for both of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8015)|
| 2:13:41| and evidently we only got one of them filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| In reading the minutes of the January 11th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8024)|
| 2:13:49| everybody that opposed it was objecting to the concept plan more than the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8029)|
| 2:13:55| And what we were trying to do is have more parking area available on this 1.4 acre that's in front of the main property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8035)|
| 2:14:06| I'm asking again today if I can have that zoned so that we can have the A1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8046)|
| 2:14:12| which we can't do anything with like it is, zoned RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| MPC staff had recommended the approval of it on their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8057)|
| 2:14:22| And, like I say, since I wasn't there and the people that opposed it, they were opposed to the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8062)|
| 2:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8070)|
| 2:14:48| Mayor, members of the council, I'm John King, 3604 Blow Drive, Lakemore Hills, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8088)|
| 2:14:58| I don't have on my hired hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| I'm here as a member of my neighborhood in opposition to this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| Working for free?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| I've been sitting here off the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| On the previous item, he had a post office box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| I made that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| I know that there are a number of my neighbors here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| I would ask that they at this time stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| They've been pretty patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| And I know that there are a couple of them who got here after the meeting started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| and didn't get a chance to sign up but who do want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| I'm going to yield at this time to at least one of those I know who's a property owner right across the street from this on Maloney Road, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8131)|
| 2:15:41| Emmett Buck Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| Emmett Buck Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| Mr. Vaughn, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| My name is Emmett Buck Vaughn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| I live at 3509 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| And, Mayor Haslam and council, you received from a young lady that's in our neighborhood that's helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8155)|
| 2:16:07| working with us on this issue and e-mailed giving you most of the points or most all of the points that we're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8167)|
| 2:16:13| Now, we went to say one thing about Mr. Weaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| I have nothing against Mr. Weaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| I'm the new guy on the block out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| My wife, Linda, and I bought out there just a year ago and redid a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8181)|
| 2:16:26| And we were excited about seeing this pretty condo development going up across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8186)|
| 2:16:31| And it was all looking nice, and that was very nice for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| And some of the neighbors asked me to talk, and I came before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| And we changed MPC's mind, and they voted 100 percent in our favor for several pretty simple reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8199)|
| 2:16:50| And in no way are we trying to hurt or I'm not trying to hurt or affect Mr. Weaver in any way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8210)|
| 2:16:56| but I do feel that his request for rezoning is wrong and for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8216)|
| 2:17:01| Number one, it's a little bitty piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| It's 1.4 acres that sits right on the greenway that you all are going to have right down beside there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8224)|
| 2:17:11| And it was designed originally, I am told, strictly for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8231)|
| 2:17:20| Well, I understand now that the rezoning of that will allow them to have more building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8240)|
| 2:17:28| more units that they can put on the land that they're building the condos on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| That's the last thing we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| We need the nice condos that were originally scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| They're even talking about now three-, four-, and maybe five-story condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8257)|
| 2:17:42| The tallest condos in this whole deal were two- and three-story that have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8262)|
| 2:17:46| Actually, all we're saying is what has been approved by MPC is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8266)|
| 2:17:53| We want them just to leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| It's a nice area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| It has a beautiful way for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| And I think if you will come out and look on Maloney Road, we live out in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| You all are the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| You're the little enclave right in the middle of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| The next thing to a four-, five-story building that you can find from our place is go to UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8291)|
| 2:18:20| I mean, this is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8300)|
| 2:18:21| It doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| Nothing fits out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8302)|
| 2:18:23| We're going to have something here that just absolutely doesn't fit in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8303)|
| 2:18:28| It ought to be two- and three-stories, and I'll even go a step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| As it comes up from the hill up toward Mr. Maxey's home, who still lives there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| it still should only be two-stories there as it comes up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| It should be three-stories down on the water and then two-stories up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8320)|
| 2:18:45| We're doing very, very little fussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| We just think that this shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| Now, one other comment that I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| If any of you all live or have driven or have even seen Alcoa Highway, I can assure you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8332)|
| 2:18:59| after living in West for about 69 years, I have never seen anything like Alcoa Highway in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8339)|
| 2:19:08| The last thing we need is one more car going out on Alcoa Highway from our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8348)|
| 2:19:16| And so to make this thing even more dense is just not what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8356)|
| 2:19:22| And I don't have any real big issues here other than leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8362)|
| 2:19:27| The MPC said with a vote of unanimous vote, leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| Thanks for hearing me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8374)|
| 2:19:35| Mr. King, did you have anything you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| You could just give us your name and address and speak to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| My name is Michelle Newton-Neal, PO Box 32218, Knoxville, 37930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8381)|
| 2:19:47| And I just wanted to address one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| I know Mr. Weaver said that now they've removed the concept plan, which is a change, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| that he was proposing to change the two- and three-story buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8393)|
| 2:19:58| so it makes it look like maybe it's okay to rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| And I don't agree at all that it's okay to rezone just because he's changed the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| One thing to keep in mind is I think I know that Mr. Becker has been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| and maybe some other people have seen that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| I don't know personally how this got changed to a city property in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| It's like what you call spot zoning or finger zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| This land is like five acres surrounded by agricultural or a county park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8422)|
| 2:20:31| When this developer came up with his first plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8431)|
| 2:20:35| he worked with the neighborhood and they worked together to try to come up with this design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| and part of it was that they decided to leave that 1.4 acres open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| It's a buffer as well as for overflow parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| The other thing is that it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8449)|
| 2:20:56| The gentleman said, I thought it was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| We've not done this much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| There's project creep going on here, and we want to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| The legal standard that Lynn Redmond said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| each planned unit shall be compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| Well, the condos are really not compatible with the surrounding development in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| but to let project creep go on is just not really acceptable to this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| and we're afraid that it can end up being more and more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| I know that Mr. Weaver owns some additional land just about an eighth of a mile away from this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| that he's cleared off, hasn't proposed any changes to that yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| but everybody's speculating that he's going to want to put condos there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| This is not something that is compatible at all with this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8506)|
| 2:21:47| Mr. Weaver, do you have something to wrap up with Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| You have about 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| I would briefly, if it's permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| and I have had one other gentleman approach me who would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8516)|
| 2:22:01| Is there a sense in which they need more speakers or not, counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| You all will need to deal with his request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| I'm just letting you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| This applicant stated his reason for appeal is the property is not appropriate size and shape for A1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8530)|
| 2:22:19| I'd just turn it back and say this piece of property is not an appropriate shape and size for RP1 either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8539)|
| 2:22:28| if you look at it as a triangular base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| His comment was that we wanted to rezone it to RP1 to give more parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8551)|
| 2:22:39| Rezoning it to RP1 doesn't give him any more parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| What it gives him is more density on the backside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| and the density that's on the backside was the subject of a negotiated situation for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8565)|
| 2:22:52| And I'm going to be like Mr. Buck says, you know, let's leave it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8572)|
| 2:22:58| Don't rezone this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| It is not appropriate in these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| Mr. Weaver, would you like to give two minutes to counter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| Some of the facts are incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| That initial triangle I never owned when we first submitted this for the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8591)|
| 2:23:18| I bought it right at a year after I bought the initial track of land where the condos are on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8598)|
| 2:23:28| I had dedicated the front portion of that for the green belt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| I've already set a fence back to allow the green belt trail to go in front of all the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| And we did need the additional parking area up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8617)|
| 2:23:43| And, like I said, after I purchased it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| I had ultimately hoped to acquire the other three tracks of land, which I bought from the Maxis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| which they gave me the first right of refusal on it when I bought the marina property from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8632)|
| 2:23:57| MPC, back in August, rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| I don't know if it's rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| They recommended rezoning of this whole triangular parcel, my triangle that's 1.4 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8643)|
| 2:24:10| and then the other three tracks of land that I have the option on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8650)|
| 2:24:14| which would ultimately tie all this property together into one piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| They had recommended that it would be zone RP1 5.9 to the acre whenever the rezoning was requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8659)|
| 2:24:28| When I made the request in December at the request of the people that was looking to buy this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| they said that's fine, just submit it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| And then, like I said, Mr. Vaughn spoke about the high rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| Fifteen more seconds, Mr. Weber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| The concept for those revisions have been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| They're not going to have a high rise there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| All they're asking for is a rezoning of that one piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Ms. Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| I move that the appeal be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| Mr. Weber, I have a question for you, a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8702)|
| 2:25:11| My understanding is that you struck a deal or an agreement with Knox County Parks and Recreation to put in a pump station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8711)|
| 2:25:19| for them to allow you to put a pump station in the middle of the county park adjacent to your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8719)|
| 2:25:26| And in return, you would build a gazebo and restrooms for the county in that park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8726)|
| 2:25:34| and that the county fulfilled its portion of the deal, but the gazebo and the restrooms have never materialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| Partially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| The county originally approached when we talked about putting the lift station on the county property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8743)|
| 2:25:48| they wanted me to build a public restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| I agreed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8751)|
| 2:25:52| I had the architect draw blueprints for the public restrooms and connect it to city sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8752)|
| 2:25:59| I let the contractor, DF Schaffner Mechanical Contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8759)|
| 2:26:02| they laid the sewer laterals and the water lines for the restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| Before we started construction on it, the county commissioners came to me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| we don't want the public restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| We would like to have a boat launch and a picnic shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| I agreed to donate the same amount of money that the bathrooms would cost for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8776)|
| 2:26:22| I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8782)|
| 2:26:23| I put the boat launch in immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| I stopped the construction on the bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| I paid Schaffner Mechanical several thousand dollars for the work they had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| I have gave the county the boat launch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| and donated materials and stuff up to the amount of money that the bathrooms would have cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8796)|
| 2:26:44| We got to the point that the picnic shelter was halfway done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8804)|
| 2:26:48| The county was to have gotten building permits and finished it from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8808)|
| 2:26:54| Half truths have been printed in the paper about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| but I did fulfill my financial obligations to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| I did give them the same amount of money or work that the bathrooms would have cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8819)|
| 2:27:05| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| Is it true that the foreclosure action has been taken on your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8829)|
| 2:27:14| and it will be sold, quote, on the courthouse steps this Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| The bank will foreclose on it and it will belong to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| I was making the request that the people that were interested in buying the property earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| Other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| Okay, there's a motion on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8855)|

| 2:27:38| The motion is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8858)|

| 2:27:42| Okay, ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| All those in favor of denying the appeal signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8865)|
| 2:27:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| Motion is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| 11B is a resolution approving an agreement with 500 Block LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| for the purchase and development of five tracts of real property in the 500 Block of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8881)|
| 2:28:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| I talked with Dr. Lyons earlier today about having a quick claim deed in case of a default by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| I understand that's been discussed with Mr. Kaiser, Dr. Lyons, and Mr. Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8894)|
| 2:28:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8895)|
| 2:28:16| But what we're going to do is in Section 5.2 of the contract where it talks about if the city exercises the reversion right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8896)|
| 2:28:23| and tenders the purchase price, we'll add some language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| and at that point the developers will execute a quick claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8905)|
| 2:28:30| And that's a promise that can be specifically enforced under the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8914)|
| 2:28:35| Mr. Alquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| Does it need to be do we need to vote on the amended version or just is the resolution adequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8916)|
| 2:28:41| The resolution is adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8921)|
| 2:28:42| There's an agreement by the parties and their lawyer to that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| I see John Craig is standing ready to talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| I don't know if anyone wants to hear from Mr. Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| I think he's fine unless we need him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| Is there anybody else that has a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8934)|
| 2:28:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8935)|
| 2:28:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| About the Florida game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8937)|

| 2:29:30| and for computer hardware and software to allow the digital data to be transferred wirelessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| from patrol cars to a server to permit it to be stored in a searchable format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8975)|

| 2:29:42| Mr. Talquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8982)|
| 2:29:43| Chief, I see Janet Wright is here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8983)|
| 2:29:46| I know you're so technically proficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| I'm sure you can answer all questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| I don't want to drag the meeting out too much longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| so I'll try to keep my question brief and trust that your answer is going to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8992)|
| 2:29:57| But when the officers go to the download points, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| where they're in the wireless areas that they have access to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9002)|
| 2:30:07| they'll download the data then from the cameras?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| I see you've got help on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| Go ahead, Janet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| I was about to give you the answer, but I'll let Janet do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9021)|
| 2:30:25| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| There's wireless access points located both at the safety building and also Knoxville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9027)|
| 2:30:32| So as the cars drive into that hot area, automatically the data starts transmitting to the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9032)|
| 2:30:39| Are there not any other wireless access points that the police cruisers use in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9039)|
| 2:30:45| I thought there were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9046)|
| 2:30:47| There are probably about 21 wireless access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| but in the beginning we're not going to use those to transfer the data for the cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| Because they don't have the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| The bandwidth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| The bandwidth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9058)|
| 2:30:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| For the record, that's Janet Wright, the director of information services for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| Chief, do you have something you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| Any other questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| Any other questions anybody has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9068)|
| 2:31:09| Chief, could you define bandwidth and exactly how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9073)|
| 2:31:14| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9074)|

| 2:39:32| for final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| So those concerns would be addressed at that time by our engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| MPC did approve our R1 recommendation based on the information that we had given them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9578)|
| 2:39:46| And the only thing that I was asking is if we were granted our R1, we would come back with a concept of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9586)|
| 2:39:53| subdivision that you all could accept addressing the drainage, the road issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9593)|
| 2:40:00| and also all the other concerns of privacy and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| So if there's any questions, I'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9604)|
| 2:40:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| Mr. Hocus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| You're wrong about the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9612)|
| 2:40:14| It's approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9614)|
| 2:40:16| This MPC, this council does not see concept plans, and they are not appealable to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9616)|
| 2:40:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| Well, I'm misinformed then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9624)|
| 2:40:27| But our concept would have to go before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9627)|
| 2:40:30| and it would have to meet all engineering and all traffic regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9630)|
| 2:40:35| And to actually rezone this R1 and put stipulations of the number of lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9635)|
| 2:40:44| I really don't understand that concept based on the development standards that I have in the booklet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9644)|
| 2:40:51| which is 789 pages if you count the city and the county together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9651)|
| 2:40:55| And I've studied that to try to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| So we're just asking to grant us our R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| and we will bring a concept back that both the neighbors and the MPC can accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9662)|
| 2:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9668)|

| 2:41:30| the neighbors met for an hour with both the owner and the developer of the 7040 Seaver Drive property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9690)|
| 2:41:39| Unfortunately, the meeting ended in a no compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| As a collective neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| we feel that a very honest attempt was made to reconcile our differences and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9704)|
| 2:41:51| We urge and respectively request that the proposed rezoning of 7040 Seaver Drive for R1 be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9711)|
| 2:41:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9718)|

| 2:42:02| I just want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9724)|

| 2:42:06| Questions or discussions from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9729)|
| 2:42:10| I'd just like to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9732)|

| 2:42:15| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9735)|
| 2:42:16| Just to say, I think it was actually a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| I think Mr. Christopher summed it up well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9739)|

| 2:42:23| The developer moved down, but they didn't come close enough to agree to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9743)|
| 2:42:27| I think this is clearly not a property we should have that many houses on, and I'll be supporting the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9747)|
| 2:42:33| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9753)|

| 2:43:15| Having no one signed up, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070227?start=9795)|
