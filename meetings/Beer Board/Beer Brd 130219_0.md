| 0:11:14| Before we vote on this and have a motion, tell us what the Fort Sanders Festival is and who is Nourish International.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=674)|
| 0:11:23| Fort Sanders Fest is an annual music festival that myself and eight other students at the University of Tennessee put on every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| It's held off campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| It serves to connect budding local Knoxville musicians with a much larger audience than they would normally get at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| a market square show or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| So what we do is that we compile them all into one big festival to get a much larger audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| And every year, well, this is the second year we'll be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| The first year we did it, we did it to benefit Nourish International.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| They're our same benefiting charity this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=714)|

| 0:12:07| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Can you tell us what Nourish International does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| They are a national organization with various local chapters around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| Knoxville is one of the biggest ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| And we're trying to help grow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| What they do is that they do small projects throughout the year in each chapter, whether that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| selling hot chocolate on campus when it's cold, selling one of the projects they did last year was selling Ugandan jewelry on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| And then at the end of the year, all the chapters compile their funds, and they do one large project overseas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| So last year, the national chapter took a trip to Peru to implement a clean water system for a village down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=760)|
| 0:12:47| Those are the types of projects that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=767)|

| 0:17:01| Give me a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| I know for suspension or the administrative hearings, the ordinance says they shall appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| Let me look here for the under qualifications of the permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| Are you asking why Ms. McNally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| I guess that's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| Ms. McNally is currently at Earth Old City taking care of things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| She just requested that I come in and stand in for her as a representative for the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| While he's looking that up, could he tell us about the two events that they're seeking a permit for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| The first one is the St. Paddy's Day event, which will actually be held on the Saturday before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| which would be March 7th or March 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| It's going to be a very typical Market Square event that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| We'll be putting bands on the Market Square stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| We've seeked out a beer permit to sell beer on the square and everything with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| It will be a very similar event in August, August 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| We haven't done any booking as far as the bands or anything along those lines yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| It's still a process that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| We haven't locked anything in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| But, as I said, very similar to the six events that we put on in Market Square last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| Very, very similar to the ones we're doing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1089)|

| 0:18:24| It shows Bernadette West as the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Is that a problem on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1110)|
| 0:18:37| I guess I'd ask Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1119)|

| 0:18:44| Is there a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| In the Tennessee Department of State, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| Article's to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Yes, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| Weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Yes, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| I probably should not have included that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| I noticed that that was in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| I pulled that out myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| That was not a document that they gave us to put in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| It was one I pulled out to signify the name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| But it is an old document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| It's 10 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Ms. McAnally has come in and since applied for a permit for Preservation Pub| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| as 100 percent owner of the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| That is my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Well, that's why I brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| I looked at our documents and I wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| That's Ms. McAnally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Councilman Grieve, do you have anything else or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| This is Ms. McAnally, I bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| No, I'm Bernadette West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| I didn't know that 2320 Highland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| If you had any questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| I think we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| Or have we had one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| He was looking up the fact of a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Provide for an agent may appear and may apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| The question, I mean, we don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| We've never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| I've usually come for Paula and I've never had an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| I've just had Jeffrey doing that because hopefully I can start delegating and not have to do this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1203)|
| 0:20:10| So I wanted to have his face in front of you for possible next things that are going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Are you fine with that, Mr. Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Councilman Grieve, are you fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Now, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Good luck with your events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Next is Uncle Matty O's pizza joint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| I don't see any pizza in his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Well, I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| I think we probably need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| This could be trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Charles Lacks, 2050 Town Center Boulevard, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| The file needs the building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and the health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| And this is in Councilman Grieve's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| Could you tell us a little bit about Uncle Pizza's joint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Pizza, quick service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| We make everything fresh from scratch in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| Very high quality ingredients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| It does go through the line and choose your toppings right in front of you, and then it's placed right in the oven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| and brought to you within six or seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| I move we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Well, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Well, we're back to the American Institute of Architecture Students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Do you represent them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| The American Institute of Architecture Students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| They're aging here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Did you used to be one of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Their event is on March the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| I think that we're possibly not seeing such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| We should go to the Kool-Aid bar then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| They're also missing a key document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Ms. Day, did they contact you about anything about not being here or delaying this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| The young man that's listed as manager did call me, and I returned his call, but I haven't heard a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| But I did send them a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| I sent a reminder letter out to all the applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| and I notated the missing corporate charter that we needed, and I haven't heard a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| So it's incomplete as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| What all are they lacking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| The non-profit charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| And what about the records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| The applicant listed has not been in for processing either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| This is not looking really good for this March 9th event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| Do I have a motion to do anything with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| Can we just let it die?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| Do I have a motion to do anything with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Yeah, motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| I'll make a motion to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| No, 30 days for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| That won't do any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| It won't do any good because their event is March the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| Is there a second for his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| Anybody for a bad motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Due to lack of a second for that motion and another motion, they will not be getting a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| We do have on the agenda an administrative hearing, and the Roaming Gnome has had two violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1395)|
| 0:23:25| The owner of the Roaming Gnome has surrendered the permit, paid the $500 fine, and left town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| Adios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| So perhaps a new owner of that establishment will change the name and the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| Just an update on some things that we're working on and the application changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| A big hurdle was if we ask people to submit their training plan for their employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| what's Ms. Day going to do with all this paperwork?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| So we put our heads together and came up with the perfect solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| and that is that if we agree that we want that on the permit, they will submit their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| She will scan it, electronically send it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| And then when they get the permit, they get the hard copy back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| But we do have a plan digitally on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| It seemed to be the easiest way to handle all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| It doesn't take very many filing cabinets when it's digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Because filing cabinets were not in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| And she seemed pleased to not have a lot of paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| On a serious note concerning the architectural students, are we going to check to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1471)|
| 0:24:41| I'm not the sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| No, I'm pointing to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| You're the commander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| Are we going to check to see what is actually going to take place during this festival?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| I mean, the event is going on, but I mean, what are we going to do as far as if they do have beer or wine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| Arrest them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| We will have an inspector on duty during that event as well as we'll let the patrol officers in that district know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| that they did not get a beer permit for the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Now, if they're giving it away, is that different than selling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| That's still against the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| It's against the open container law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| It's still against the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Are we going to notify them to let them know that they do not have a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| If you can, if you can get a hold of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Typically, that's not something that we do because they do have a responsibility as an applicant to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| So if we want to be nice, I suppose we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| But we need to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Are we going to be setting a precedent for people who are negligent in hearing through on their permit application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1543)|
| 0:25:52| Do we notify people even when they come here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| Do we send a letter or anything saying they've gotten a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| They get the permit when they are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| You guys are so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| There's no reason for a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| I want to move to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| Can I join you folks over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| We're full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| They're full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| No room at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| I just want to make sure that we don't have a number of young folks that get in trouble because they didn't do what they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| Well, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| But if they're mature enough and old enough to apply for this, they ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| But one other thing that I do want to address in this regard, if they do decide to hire a caterer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| and the caterer has the permit, then they would be able to have beer at this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| Oh, the caterer might have an annual permit that they could bring that travels with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| Go through a different path than the beer board to get their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| And so, and I know, George, you've asked some questions about the catering aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| And they do not come through the beer board if they are a caterer to get the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| They go through TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| They have it on the World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Well, they would have to have a special event permit in order to use that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| So they would still have to file a security plan, which we're getting within the 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| But otherwise, they can drink all the Dr. Pepper they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| Whatever they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Is there any other business before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Hearing none, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130219?start=1643)|
