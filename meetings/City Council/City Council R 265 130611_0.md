| 0:22:17| Second. Councilman Dela Valle. Quick question for Jim I guess we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| basically going to handle the runoff off the parking lot pavement so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| capture and clean it up before it gets into the stormwater streams is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| idea? Yeah this is their service facility so there is some oils and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| yeah diesel and stuff there is actually already some treatment in place there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| but it as it turns out it's just somewhat inadequate there's just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| enough capacity and we're getting some petroleum stuff and into the creek and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| we're also it's also making the asphalt crumble so we're getting asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| crumbles in the in the creek. Is that the professional term? Yeah. There's a cake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| with asphalt crumbles I think. Yeah we had a chocolate cake this evening. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1388)|
| 0:23:18| going to replace some of the asphalt or this project includes replacing some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| that asphalt with concrete so that that stops as well as as the improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| treatment. The diesel fuel was breaking down like it or some solvent was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| breaking down the asphalt. Right. Well you capture it what in a basin and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| pump it out and treat it what do you do? There's a standard water quality unit as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| we call them is is a underground chamber that allows some settling it's got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| skimmer on top so it captures. So you catch it and you clean it and you deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| with it? Yeah yeah and it it still discharges to the creek but if if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| capacity of that unit isn't big enough for the circumstances then some of it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| going to still get in the creek so in this particular case we just need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| capacity. Okay thank you. Thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1444)|

| 0:24:56| Councilman Dela Valle. Yeah I think I know the answer to this but but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| essentially we're doing some housekeeping here we we already approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| the TIF activity for the urban outfitters remodeling and all that and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| turns out we had to review the boundary and have KCDC include that in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| definition of the redevelopment area. That's correct we need to amend the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| and it's all we're doing at this point in time. If you don't amend the map then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| you can't do the financing and all that. Correct. Okay thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| Councilman Grave. Yeah Bob how do we determine about changing the map I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| can you just. I'll tell you Jordana Nelson is here with KCDC she's been the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| working the details on this I'd like for her to come forward to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| question. If there's another building that's adjacent to the area that wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| to get a TIF they can automatically. Well you can always amend these plans were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| created by Council and KCDC and can be amended by Council and KCDC so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| always have that option. Jordana if you want to talk about the process. I'm Jordana| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Nelson 4019 Tallulah Avenue. This is essentially a housekeeping measure the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| plan was already amended to include this building however we don't feel like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| amendment was quite specific enough so we're coming back and just being very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| specific about including this particular building in the redevelopment area but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| we feel like it's already approved. So how difficult or how easy is it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| another building adjacent to become part of the plan or part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| redevelopment area how's that how's that process work? Essentially it's the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| process that we're doing right now we would have to come back before Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| and Commission and have that amendment to the redevelopment area approved. Does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| the building have to be adjacent I mean. Well you're mic'd down. I'm sorry does it have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| adjacent to the area or can some other place downtown become part of the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| What I can tell you about that is that we have not yet approved an area in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| non-contiguous redevelopment area. It would probably depend on what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| financing that you were trying to do would look like but my gut reaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| would be that that would not be a great idea but it's certainly something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| we could look at on a case-by-case basis. If there's a particular building wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| look at please let us know. There's more than one redevelopment district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| downtown so it may be contiguous to another. Yeah I realize that I just didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| know the process that you went through. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1638)|

| 0:30:40| because that is one person without backup we feel like this action will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| enable us to respond more quickly and strengthen that ability to respond. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1847)|

| 0:31:24| the past several years. Does that mean that so fair housing complaints have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| down so one I was looking at the numbers and two if that trend changes are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| going to monitor that so if that trend changes that we could then take action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| We can always respond and go back to being a fair housing assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1898)|

| 0:31:47| investigate. We certainly will communicate and work closely with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1907)|

| 0:32:54| believe and I hope that we'll be on the right track in terms of passing this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| the Tennessee Human Rights Commission and I'll have a question for Miss Watts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1979)|

| 0:33:08| this afternoon you did answer my questions very well but you pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| that you do have workshops for landlords and so that they are aware do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| you think that maybe those attendance at those workshops and their success might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| be contributing to the decline in the number of complaints or is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| coincidental? Well I would hope so I would hope that our training efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| have helped to educate landlords and property owners in the city so that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| better understand what the laws are you know we will continue those efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2015)|

| 0:34:00| owners to get funds from the city to rehab rental property we are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| require that they have fair housing training to be a participant in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| program. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Watts would you mind coming down and thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2049)|

| 0:35:07| associations in this area over the last seven years since I've been the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| to help them understand as well if there are any questions I'll be happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2112)|

| 0:35:27| with us as well so great thank you mayor Brown you have a question I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| one question I want to ask all the complaints down I know we're concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| about Knoxville but across the state I'm curious of our complaints up are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| down or how's that going in recent years across the statewide across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| we're probably running an average of about a hundred and twenty hundred and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| thirty intakes and we're closing somewhere around that amount every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| and that's been going on for the last seven years there are peaks and valleys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| in this work I've been doing it for a few years and what I figured out is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| sometimes it works and actually training does help but generally there are always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| some things that come up sometimes landlords forget to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| person's disabilities and sometimes there's a spike in issues around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| service animal issues especially in housing always comes up so we see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| variety of issues and variety of things but I think we're on average or about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| hundred and thirty which has been consistent for the last seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| there is an increase in not rental but there is an increase in the notion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| financial issues and housing and those are up generally in West Tennessee not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2202)|

| 0:39:21| of the roads that we built all of the site and grading and drainage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| utilities when the final as built survey was done there were a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| issues on either side of the street and one of those pertain to the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| retaining wall and a sidewalk that in the final analysis was a few inches or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| foot or so over what was the right-of-way line that we and ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| had plotted originally same issue happened on the other side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| where we place some water quality unit structures and then a small retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| wall around that side same issue on that side so the the city and the engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2396)|
| 0:40:03| felt that that they didn't want to have that in the right-of-way so they asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| us to replot that and I'm speaking in very general terms here I have my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| engineer here if there's any more specific questions or details that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| left out I may ask him to get up but essentially that is so that the the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2419)|
| 0:40:28| would be in our private property so that the city would never have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| responsibilities from a liability standpoint or from a maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| standpoint but also though there's a scheduling issue that one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2437)|
| 0:40:45| you asked for it to be on emergency reading reason I asked for it to be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| emergency reading is there was a series of bonds and letters of credit that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| issued securing not only target stores as a property owner but the State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| Department of Transportation and the city of Knoxville and from a timing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| standpoint some of those are set to expire and we need to probably replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| with the city but in order to do that because of all the legal entanglements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| having target in the city and everybody else together we really need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| both readings occur on this and that will allow us then to isolate out and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| a renewable bond that will protect the city for any remaining work that needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| to be completed. Councilman Dallavopi. Yeah thank you mayor I appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| this is a technical cleanup so the bond issues. It's kind of a housekeeping item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| yes. Yeah I got a question for Mr. Swanson I think it's just that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| foolish enough to read this document but in the in the in the AIS section it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2504)|
| 0:41:51| talks about the 229 feet and the 696 feet and that's what Miss Mitchell read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| if you read the the technical plat descriptions of portion one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| there's references to a 1279 square foot and that may just be a pure area matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| and a 646 and I just wanted to make sure I'm looking at page three of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| resolution I'm assuming those are different things and that we are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| misstating the the number of feet or whatever it is we're doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| description I would assume is a surveyors description and he probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| did it with a transit and everything else but I was wondering if that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| discrepancy you need to look at or not. I'd love to have the training to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| to answer that question I'm going to have to defer to our director of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| engineering that's more an engineering question than it is a lawyer question I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| think. Okay if you had your little you know the planet thing there you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| stretch it out and go 10 degrees to the north and 12. Actually no I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| Hagerman. Councilman are you looking at the ordinance or the yeah I'm looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| the well at the the ordinance language on the third page of it where it has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| property descriptions and if I had two hours I guess I could plot out all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| information of where you start where you end up but there was a reference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| 1,279 feet in the third from the last line of portion one and 646 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| in the other I'm assuming that's a calculation that's totally accurate I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| don't know whether the caption just references where it is in relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| to North Shore and that's but I was hoping someone to check those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| because they were different yeah the the distances that are described in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| agenda summary are just locational locational and the area is the amount is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2618)|
| 0:43:48| a computation of the actual area in that okay yes all right relation of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2628)|

| 0:45:53| for an amendment to the West City sector plan from low-density residential to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| medium-density residential for property located on the southeast side of Dean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| Hill Drive northeast side of Winchester Drive 2nd district madam mayor we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2760)|
| 0:46:12| three three issues dealing with this particular one would someone explain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| order in which we do this first you amend the sector plan then you amend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2776)|
| 0:46:26| one-year plan then you amend the actual zoning classification for that piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| property itself but you can't rezone property so that it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| inconsistent with either the sector plan or the one-year plan so you have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| those other two first because it's not appropriate under state law for you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| amend the parcel of property to a zoning designation that is that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| not planned for excuse me if you're concerned about the zoning though you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| still go through the other two or do you not deal with the other two if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| concerned about the zoning classification well if you don't want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| to be rezoned there's no reason to do any of them thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| councilman Delvaux thank you madam mayor I see that buzz is here to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| understand some of this and as I understand it reading the material the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| staff wanted to stay low-density residential and not increase the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| to up to 12 units I think they were asking for 10 but is that is that a fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| statement that's that's correct all right and is that I mean the full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| commission acted differently on that but but the staff thought that it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| more correct or more consonant with the local single-family housing to keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| as a as a low density which would be almost it's like up to six it was five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| point nine nine units per acre which I guess for ease of discussion is six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| units per acre that's what low-density residential would allow that's that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| correct in the city that's the the cutoff we use five point nine nine units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| per acre for low density and the medium density goes up to 12 actually in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| city medium density goes up to 24 up to 24 okay thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2891)|
| 0:48:20| councilman grave it's excuse me and it's presently zoned current sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2900)|
| 0:48:29| shows that LDR current one-year plan shows that LDR current zoning is our one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2909)|
| 0:48:37| and that allows how many units are one well you in the r1 zone you base it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| lot size and minimum lot size of 7,500 square feet so depending upon if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2923)|
| 0:48:50| were looking at a subdivision of our one property it would you'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| subtract out roughly 20% for roads so it you're looking in the neighborhood of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| three and a half to four units per acre when all said and done in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| particular case you could base it on how big the area is 2.2 acres and you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2943)|
| 0:49:11| do the math from there times seven you know some 7,500 square feet so so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2951)|
| 0:49:20| basically yeah mayor is there anyone here to speak on this no one has signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| up but sir would you like to speak to this item please state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| address for the record and Rocky Smith 4909 Ball Road I'm with Rufus Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| Associates we've owned this property for approximately 40 years and this density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| may sound a little high and going to a medium density but we've got an old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| duplex there it's kind of run down Mike Chase our neighbor we spoke to that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| is kind of redeveloping and going to medium density we had no opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| maybe the commissioners had the benefit of looking at what we're going to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| we show that we could easily put in about 20 22 units all brick townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| and I think they felt like it'd be quite an improvement and we had no opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| there we had none of the neighbors and we feel like we'd like to have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| recommend approved here thank you sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| Councilman great yeah mayor I think that's part of the problem is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| don't really know what they're going to build I mean we haven't had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| advantage to see what these what these plans are and there has been some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| concern over the density terms of what what they're asking for versus what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| could have at medium I think 5.9 if it's yeah and I want to yeah I want to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| to that if you if it were zoned r1 you would end up pretty much with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| different density than if it's PR at 5.9 9 or PR at 12 or 10 you multiply it by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| your density the size of the acreage and it doesn't necessarily depend upon you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| know what what you have in the roads and all that kind of stuff you don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| subtract it out it's not a minimum lot size so you get it you get a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| number the low end probably is going to be our one the upper end would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| planned residential at 5.9 9 or PR at 10 well I think we are can you clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3077)|
| 0:51:26| that's the plan residential that's correct all right it was using a term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| there councilman grave you still have the floor thank you mayor I think one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| the concerns and some of the neighbors have spoken to me about and I think a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| number of my colleagues are aware of the fact that Dean Hill is becoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| overburdened with traffic and we have two major apartment complexes going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| down the street and so I have a concern about that from a standpoint number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| number one the traffic number two we haven't really had the advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| seeing what was going to be built there and so whether it's five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| or ten units per acre or 20 units we don't know and basically everything to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| the West is either duplexes or single-family homes that are on the to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| the as I said to the West to the east we do have large tracts of land and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| further east we do have those kind of developments but I would feel a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| comfortable if we postpone this until we could really see as council what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| plans are that they're talking about instead of just going out and saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| okay you can do it is that a motion to post I'd make a motion that we postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| pardon me I'll make a motion that we postpone for 30 days oh I'm sorry all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3157)|

| 0:53:18| you provide some of that drawings and assure us what y'all are going to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| and I mean because there is single-family right across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| from that and I mean and there's 1.5 three parcels on Dean on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| being he'll drives there got one point more 5.9 and 5.3 so I mean it's a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| big job to go to I mean I think we'd like to show us what you're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| and give us some assurance does that give you enough time to do that yes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| would depend on what form I mean do you want us just to present to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| individually or get it to you email I mean whatever way you want us to do it I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| mean 30 days if it's not enough we'll just postpone again okay you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| comfortable that yeah okay I'm good I just think it's a it's that area is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| it's you've got a railroad track there there's just a limited ability you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| do the things there and it this this way we were going to tear down the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| duplex and do a lot of and we just really thought it would be a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| improvement and well you don't see that again I don't have a problem with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| what it's going to be I just don't know what it's going to be understand and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| if we could say that you know we'd have better understanding and I think if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3263)|

| 0:54:38| if if if the question is plan or site review one of those other categories is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| there some planned residential description or zoning that that provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| for that in other words that that would allow public input on a on the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| plan in other words is that is there a better zone to be looking at if the goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| is to accommodate you know various views and on the actual proposal well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3300)|
| 0:55:08| the planned residential zone rp1 zone allows that possibility it it adds a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| second well I'll take that back it it requires a site plan to be prepared and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130611?start=3314)|
