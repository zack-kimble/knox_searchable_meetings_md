| 0:01:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker, would you kindly lead us in a Pledge of Allegiance to our nation's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| Would everyone please rise and face our nation's flag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=89)|
| 0:01:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=98)|
| 0:01:41| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| I know we've got a nice audience here tonight and before we go into tonight's agenda I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| to welcome all of our guests if this is your first visit to a County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| I also know we have a lot of folks who may be watching this meeting online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| and what I'd like to do at the beginning of our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| is also kind of help talk a little bit about exactly why we're here and what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| Tonight's meeting is considered a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| So what that means is tonight we're going to be going through the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| of all the items that have been proposed for consideration at this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| We will be formalizing our agenda to vote next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| You will see us take some items that are placed on our consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| which means that we'll be able to vote on all of them in one vote next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| So I guess thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| If you have any questions at public forum at the end, you can ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| Also, before we begin tonight's meeting, I know the mayor has something that we'd like to talk to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| but I'd like to say something about a dear person, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| I think we're on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| We lost a public servant this past week who was a fixture, a legend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=173)|
| 0:03:02| an institution around the city county building named Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| Arthur was an attorney, but he was a lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| He was a passionate advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| He was a historian and spent an awful lot of time volunteering with nonprofits in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=196)|
| 0:03:24| teaching history, serving on boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| While known as a person who advocated for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| he also spent time in the early days helping us with our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| looking at things like our early growth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| He's been, frankly, in this building for over 20 years in front of our courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| in front of our city council folks, in front of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| What I'd like to do is have a moment of silence before we move in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| and then I'll invite if any other commissioners would like to say any words about Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| But if you all could please, we'll have about a brief moment of silence for Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=237)|
| 0:04:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| If any other commissioners would like to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Well, along with Arthur, who is a friend and a statesman and a gentleman to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| whether you opposed him or not, he was a great friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| But also, Ron McPherson's father, Ron with the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| has been one of those guys, him and his dad both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| one of those guys that if you say anything bad about him, you don't know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| So he is, I think, the receiving friends tonight, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| So keep Ron and his family in your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| Yes, Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Yes, and Commissioner Anders brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| I wanted to say a word about Ron McPherson as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| He was a school board member for the 8th District and a friend to a lot of people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| There is a graveside service tomorrow at 2 o'clock at Woodlawn Cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| if anyone who can't go tonight would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| And Arthur was a great friend and a great thinker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| That's how I'll remember him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| I was just there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| There's a light on over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| About Arthur Seymour, when I first got on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| MPC got involved in things that are going on in the courthouse here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| sat right out there on the end and Arthur was right down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| and he was one of the first people I met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| And I always noticed that he was always not only just pushing for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| but pushing for good developments in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| And he had the county in mind when he was up here speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| and when he was talking to developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| And he brought some great things into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| We're going to miss him greatly for what he had brought into the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| that were good developments that brought in additional tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| that does a lot of other things for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| So, again, we've just lost a great person that's helped us along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| And I'll say he was just as much a gentleman when he lost something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| as he was when he won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| But go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| And also, Arthur was very involved with the Knoxville Airport Authority, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| serving on that board for many years and was a big impact to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| But I always kind of considered him as the 12th commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| because not that he got a vote, but he had his attendance here was phenomenal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| and not only, like you said, with the county commission and city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| but the Board of Zoning Appeals as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| I think he missed very many of those meetings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| So he will be sorely missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| He sure will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Seeing no other lights, I'll go ahead and begin setting tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| For the public, we have part of our meeting where we dedicate it to the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| where we have public forum, which gives a chance to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| Before we go into public forum, I do have a special proclamation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| that is actually not on our agenda tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| but I'd like to ask Mayor Jacobs to come before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| and he will go ahead and tell you why he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| So, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| This is a proclamation to publicly recognize women in public office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| And it reads, whereas the month of March is Women's History Month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| and celebrates the significant contributions women of all races, ethnicities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| and backgrounds have made to the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| and whereas women play a critical role in the vitality and diversity of our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| and are essential to ensuring Knox County is well represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| and whereas while the 20th century was a pivotal time of growth for women entering politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| women remain underrepresented in male-dominated fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| and thus providing opportunities to support women in public office is imperative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| and whereas recognizing women in public office will bring awareness to the fundamental necessity of their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| and will inspire other young people to serve their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| Now, therefore, I, Glenn Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Knox County Mayor, do hereby proclaim tomorrow, May 19th, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| as Women in Public Office Day in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| and urge all citizens to participate in this observance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| And I was wondering if it would be okay if Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| and other female elected officials in the audience would join me for a picture, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=533)|
| 0:09:04| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=544)|
| 0:09:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=570)|
| 0:09:43| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| We're now at the part of our agenda where we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| I have had several folks contact me to speak to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| I also want to advise my fellow commissioners and the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| that our friend Commissioner Carson Daly and I spoke last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| actually after he'd had his surgery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| and he advised me that Wendy Edwards from Knoxville BMX would be speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| He said that there were multiple folks from Knoxville BMX that wanted to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| However, Wendy would be speaking for all of the Knoxville BMX club members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| So, Wendy, I know you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Is there anybody else from your club that's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| I know that Commissioner Daly had asked you to represent the club specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| And then I think we may have some other community members related to BMX who may want to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| So, what I might say is if you're here to speak on the BMX, would you please raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=635)|
| 0:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Here's who I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| I have Wendy Edwards, Ben Ream on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| And I have Barry Neal and Mark Bauman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| So, Wendy, are you going to cover just for the club and all that, those folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| You will have ten minutes and then, because I know you want everybody from the club speaking, if that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| And then I believe we have, I'm going to go ahead and verify this, Barry Neal and Mark Bauman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=669)|
| 0:11:18| And Ben, are you with Wendy, if there's a Ben here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| No, I'm a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Then we'll go in this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Wendy, Ben, Barry, Mark, as it relates to BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=688)|
| 0:11:37| And Wendy, as arranged in advance, since you're representing multiple folks, you're going to have ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| Each other speaker will have five minutes maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| I also have, confirming other folks who have advised for public forum, Clayton Wood and Liza, Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=706)|
| 0:11:55| Is that Liza or Lisa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Liza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| But I have Clayton Wood and Liza and Angel Bauman, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| So, that is who I've got preregistered for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| I know that there are some folks who have come out regarding the spay and neuter item that's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| So, for that subject, I'm going to hold the forum until we get to that item on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| because there may be some questions specific to it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| So, with that said, we have effectively set the agenda for the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| So, I will now ask Wendy Edwards to approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=749)|
| 0:12:44| I'm Wendy Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| My address is 2537 Kings Mountain Lane, and I'm in 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| And I'm here today to speak on behalf of Knoxville BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| The stack of papers I have with me is every email, every bid, every document that's been done on this track in the last six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| We've been working with initially the city and county, but now the county, for six years on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| I am not going to go through every single document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| I brought them because I wanted you guys to know that everything I'm going to be referencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| and talking about is based on either an actual document or a meeting that took place that I or our group was at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| So, what we were involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| So, it is all based on factual events that have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| And I would like to start out and just say thank you, Chairman Nystrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| and thank you, commissioners, for letting us come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| This is really important to us because we felt that after six years, at the very end of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| specifically in the last few months, we've been shut out of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| As we know, and we came and spoke in November, when we were here in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| we said that we had some concerns that the bid from DNARC was going to be high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| because we had heard some things from Carson, and that we had concerns with that that was not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| We'd been speaking with USA BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| We'd been speaking with people in our group about this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| So, we came before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| We spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| We talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| And we asked for more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| We asked you guys to vote on a line item because we wanted more time because we wanted to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Since that has happened, Carson was going to have a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| and he wanted us to be in the meeting as well as the mayor and PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| So, we were excited about that because we had some options, some solutions, things we've been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| And in that time frame, we were called in the last couple weeks and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| the mayor, they don't want you to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| They don't want you in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| I don't know why, and that's okay that we don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| But we're here now to speak because we couldn't speak in that meeting, so we're here now to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| So, to get that kind of started, I want to start off with this bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| and I'm going to respond directly to the mayor's address this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| He spoke and said that the reason that this process was a little tricky was because you have to have a BMX vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| that's approved through USA BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| USA BMX does not approve vendors or contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| What they do is they certify track builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| A track builder is a very, very small part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| A track builder, and the one that is used, that DNARC used in their bid, is called Pump Tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| They're out of Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I have their bid here referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| They sent it to DNARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Their portion of the bid was approximately, and this is just to build the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| All that USA BMX does, they certify these builders to make sure tracks are built properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| They do not certify general contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| They have no connection with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| They sanction tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| They sanction the track once it's built, but they do not build tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| They refer you to the track builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| They expect cities and municipalities to find a general contractor that knows what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| and that knows how to build a BMX track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And if they don't, they are open to people to call and ask for information and suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| Pump Tracks gave them a bid of $188,148.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| That is a very small part of the $1.9 million estimate that came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=956)|
| 0:16:02| So the reason that I'm talking about this is because in the mayor's address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| he referenced that because the BMX vendor, which I think he's talking about Pump Tracks specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| the bid was too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Pump Tracks did not make that bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| DNARC Construction made that bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| The problem with that process is that DNARC Construction, per emails that I've read through, passed initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=976)|
| 0:16:25| They didn't want that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| They had no BMX experience, and they didn't want to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| They were assigned that bid by the county, which is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| but when we spoke with Carson, and as our advocate, he went to them to tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| that this was sounding like it was too high instead of us getting the opportunity to come before and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| listen, USA BMX, through their contact, has told us about a general contractor in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1004)|
| 0:16:52| that was affiliated with the track build in Powder Springs, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| That track was built and stayed on budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| and they felt confident that this general contractor could put us in the right direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| to get this track bid on budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| The county uses PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| As we know, in this process, they signed the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| PBA paid, canon and canon, $81,000 for an engineer who designs 90% of the tracks in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1032)|
| 0:17:23| His name is Mark McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| I'm sorry, Mike McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| We know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| My husband's spoken to him on the phone multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| He does this for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| He engineers and designs BMX tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| He, for the county paying him to do that, he designed the track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| and he gave them a cost estimate down to the dollar of what this project should cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| All of his tracks come in at budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| He's building the world's track in Texas as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| He knows what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| The county had his document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| I don't know, but it doesn't sound like it was referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| because when you get a bid back from DNARC that is nowhere near a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| it's a million dollars plus over what it should have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| then why would they not go back and look at the engineer's plan that they paid $81,000 for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1083)|
| 0:18:10| and reference and say, Whoa, something's not adding up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| So that was a little frustrating on our end because we knew it wasn't adding up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| and we had solutions to this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| We had ways that we could say, Let us put you in contact with the general contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| Let us help here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| We have contacts with BMX, but we weren't allowed to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| We weren't allowed to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Carson asked for us to have this rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| Please let us have this rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Don't kill this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| We know we can save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| And the bottom line is we don't want to waste taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| And so in looking at all that and talking about this bid and the issues that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1121)|
| 0:18:50| that brings me to the point that not only has taxpayer money been spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| but $487,091.44 has been spent to excavate, to design, and move the dirt for this track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1135)|
| 0:19:06| That's a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| The engineer's estimate on what it would cost to build this track, just the track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| not including the ADA upgrades, but the track, was just under $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| With ADA upgrades, it was at about $850,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| That's what this bid should have said from DNARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| That's how much this would have cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| So our frustration just lies in the fact that we couldn't come before anyone and talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| We couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| So I'm going to move on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| There's a couple other things because I'm not going to fit all this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| I'll give you another minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| I know this is really a passionate subject for South Knoxville, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Well, beyond the bid part, that's one of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| We had solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| We wanted to present those solutions because, in my mind, I sit and think, okay, this is taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| Instead of wasting $500,000, why don't we sit down and find solutions to not waste this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| Let's see if we can get this completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Secondly, though, I'm going to read a quote Mayor Jacobs had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| With that in mind, he was talking about the bid being high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Combined with the uncertainty surrounding the long-term maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| and its ability to draw races that would help pay for the track through its positive impact on our economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| I decided it was too much of a risk to take with taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| USABMX sat upstairs in a meeting in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| I was there, and they said, if we need, we will give you a written contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| guaranteeing you at least three years of nationals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| Written, written, not said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Not just a verbal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| A national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Mayor also has referenced the impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Got the impact study, and it shows just over $8 million in five years is return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| We were guaranteed three nationals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| That's over $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| I'm just going to address that real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| There was a return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| It was guaranteed because it could have been put in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| Secondly, when we talked about the other thing he mentioned was maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| we sent Mayor a six-page letter regarding maintenance and what our organization does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| I'm not going to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| I wanted to, but I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| I don't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| It lists out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| It spells out every last thing of maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| It tells you everything that NAWQA BMX is responsible for down to liability, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| I mean, it's all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| It was sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| If you guys need copies, it's all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| I mean, we have all of this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| And lastly, about the taxpayer dollars at risk, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| I would much rather not waste $500,000, consider solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| find something that we can invest in that's a guaranteed return on our investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| I mean, USA BMX, they don't promise nationals to everybody, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| It's not something that they commonly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| And they said they were willing to put it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| They want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| And they have been working with Visit Knoxville and with the Sports and Tourism Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| because they want to put an indoor national here as well as an outdoor national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| An indoor national can go inside of some facility similar to Thompson Bowling or the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| Well, since this has happened, and my husband talks with them on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| they've said they're no longer considering an indoor national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| because they don't like the way their people were treated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| That would have been another $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| They would have committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Louisville, Kentucky has had an indoor national for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| That was canceled this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| They wanted to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| That's a $4 million return between two national events in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| And so we're just frustrated because now they're like, we don't want to come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| We'll consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| If you get an outdoor track, then absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| We want to be in your city, but we want you to be treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| So of all this, and I will probably spend another minute or two, and I will be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| because I'm really hurrying through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| But I just want to say, you know, why was this shut down prematurely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| You know, the most frustrating part for us is that we want to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| because six years of work is an awful lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| and our mission is more than just a return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| We're here because we want to serve the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| and we have so many programs for these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| And so who loses out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Well, yeah, we lose out financially as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| but who loses out is kids, families, business owners in that community in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| That's who loses out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| I mean, I've listed them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| When I was here in November, I listed all these for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| I mean, we've got we had donors lined up that were going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| underprivileged kids' bikes and helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| We were going to pay their dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| We were not going to even charge them to come in races because USAVMX,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| there's fees for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| We were going to put them on scholarships because we want those kids on bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| because we don't want them on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| We had support of DEA 360 because they want kids off the streets because of drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| In that community, kids ride the streets on their bikes, getting into trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| But we ran into several of them, and you know what they wanted to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| They wanted to get on that VMX track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| I did not intend to get emotional, but it breaks my heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| because there's so many kids that can benefit from this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| And I talk to them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| And I'll back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| I was a social worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| I worked in Knox County schools, certified emotionally disturbed children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| I've seen these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| I've seen kids that benefit from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| And I'm telling you, the community and the city needs this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| And we just don't want to give up on a dream and a project over money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| that honestly could be rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| I know it would come in under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| We know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| We know the people who do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| So where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Wendy, you've got about a minute left here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| And I'm closing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| I've been extremely kind, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Just one minute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Y'all, our mission doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| As Knoxville VMX, we want a VMX track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| We think South Knoxville deserves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| You know, the thing that put the project over budget in the first place is not the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| It's the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| That stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| They came in and said it's not ADA compliant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| and it's a risk of life because there's too much space in between the bleachers, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| So those kids in the middle school can't use it as it is anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| It's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| It's not ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| The county can get sued for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| So it can't be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| It's sitting there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Knox County gets it back, and it still can't be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| So I hate for something like the stadium to kill the whole project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| when, honestly, it probably needs to be made safer to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| Okay, Wendy, 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Anyway, I just had probably ten more minutes I could have talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Honestly, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| But I just want to thank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| There's several people here, and I would like everybody to stand up that's here for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1544)|
| 0:25:55| Everybody that's here, they got here in about a two-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| We put something out, and we said, if you guys want this, just come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| Show people that you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| We got business owners in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| We've got people that live out of state that have said, what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| Can we come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| People want to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| People want to be here for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| People want this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| That's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| I don't know if there's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| There was another girl that raised this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| She's 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| She's a youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| I don't know if you want to hear her statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| She had a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| It's probably 30 seconds long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Okay, if it's 30 seconds, I'll hear it, but we do need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you for sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Thank you for your passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| She can approach us, say her name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| I'll give her 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Her name is Sydney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| She's another BMX racer, and it's important to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| I feel like she should be able to say it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| Hi, I'm Sydney Wellborn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| I just want to say, how many of your kids or grandkids play sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| and have sat on the bench almost all game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| See, with BMX, that will never happen because it's not like a team sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| Do your own thing and learn at your own risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| I have been racing for two years, and it has helped me a lot with my confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| and helped me out on the bad days I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| I love BMX and all the friends that I have made on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| I really hope that you all change your minds about the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| We like to have young folks share with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| We appreciate you being here, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| Next on public forum, I have Ben Ream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| Am I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| And please approach the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| Ben Ream, 510 Tipton Avenue, Knoxville 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Esteemed commissioners and Mayor Jacobs, thank you so much for attending this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| And thank you for everybody who's come out to support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| I personally have no vested interest in seeing the track built beyond the fact that I'm a resident of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| and of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| I want to see both of these enterprises flourish as best as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| and this project, I believe, is essential to accomplishing exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| Having spent the last several days speaking with all involved, both directly and tangentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| I've come to one single conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| The facts and figures regarding the project are in dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| That being said, the one thing everybody does seem to agree on is that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| a significant amount of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| have already been spent in the building of this track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| but also that if it were to be completed in a manner that pleased everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| it would be of indisputable benefit to the county and to Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| Canceling this project as it stands right now is a lose-lose scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| The money we've already spent can be counted nothing but as waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| and the effort, the unbelievable effort that many, like Wendy and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| and many both public and private, have put into the project goes to waste as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| This is lose-lose, and it's a silly thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| The community will also lose out on the opportunity cost of having such a world-class asset in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| I think everybody here understands the benefit that things like the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| like the places and facilities we have at Iams, at Meade's Quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| all the new businesses along Sevier Avenue, Baker Creek Bottoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| have brought to our thriving city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| There's been tremendous investment, both public and private, in the track as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| Cancellation would harm not only these, but the other tangential enterprises that are associated with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| the businesses that are in South Knoxville and Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Hotels, restaurants, tourist-driven attractions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| even things like gas stations and convenience stores stand to gain tremendously from this asset in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1804)|
| 0:30:13| Not only is the positive benefit of having these, the positives that these can get into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1813)|
| 0:30:21| not only are there positives, there are negatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| We have built an economic ecosystem in Knoxville, and in South Knoxville specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| It only functions at its optimal level when all of these pieces are working together as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| Any one of these taken away, especially as significant as one as this, is harmed by all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| I'm specifically concerned about Baker Creek Bottoms and the significant investment placed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| It could be threatened by the loss of confidence of the investors in that property based on what's happened here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1844)|
| 0:30:53| The cost of the track is only part of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| As Wendy stated, it's not just about the cost, it's about the economic impact that it can have as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| Basically, you take the top number and divide it by the bottom number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| and if the bottom number is big, then the top number also has to be big in order to make it economically viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| That's the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| The millions upon millions of dollars that are documented to be potentially brought into the county are indisputable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| The bid itself certainly can be reworked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| There's more work that can be done on this, and it seems silly at this point to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| The opportunity cost to the community at large is going to be tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| The programs, not just in terms of money, but also for the children of Knoxville as a whole, would lose out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| and not just Knoxville, in the surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| I don't think it takes a whole lot of imagination to see school bus trips being brought to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| I don't think it takes a whole lot of imagination to see school bus trips being brought to this place specifically for this individual asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| The track is going to be an economic engine that provides not only for itself, but for future projects as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| We don't want the growth to be stopped with this individual thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| We want it to be able to fund other priorities as time goes along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| and it can only happen if we have the political will to accomplish this goal, which I believe exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| I think it's evident that the tremendous support that this project enjoys, both in the community at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| but also in those who are most active in local politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| and I'm grateful for everybody who turned out in order to support a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Thank you, Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| Next, I have Barry Neal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Barry Neal, 2703 South Haven Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| I'm going to be reading remarks here prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| Good afternoon, Mayor Jacobs, Hall Director Armstrong, and members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| I'm Barry Neal, the Selective Representative of the South Haven Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| I'm here to express our support for the BMX track project at South Doyle Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| The members of our association met this last Saturday and voted to offer our remarks here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| to ask the Commission to continue with and to complete the BMX track project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| We feel this project is a reasonable investment in the future of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| The positives of this project are numerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Besides providing physical fitness and recreational opportunities for all the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| this project will create a venue that will generate countless visitors to our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| The guests will produce tax revenues from hotel, motel, and sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| from the dollars these visitors will bring to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| This project is the epitome of the phrase, build it and they will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| When we complete this project, local, regional, and even national BMX events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| will find this an outstanding venue for their competitions, as you've already heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| In the mid-1980s, this same body was asked to support another community-wide project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| of a similar potential impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| The Commission at that time voted to spend millions of dollars of the hotel, motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| on their share of the Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| That was a wise investment of that Commission at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| A prudent, visionary decision which has returned the investment dollars many times over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2093)|
| 0:35:03| I and my neighbors feel this BMX track project would be an excellent investment by this Commission at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| that will reap benefits for our community many years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| Thank you for allowing me to deliver these remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you, Barry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| I have Mark Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| Please correct me if I've mispronounced your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| My name is Mark Bowman, 7549 Berkshire Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| I live in North Knoxville in Powell, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2139)|
| 0:35:47| Forgive me if I repeat some things that have been said because they've really done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| My interest in this is from the 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| How many of you, if you wouldn't mind raising your hand, have been to a BMX race?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| Pretty fine, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| And there are a lot of people that show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| And they come from all over the country, not just around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| This is not a backyard, I don't know, free-for-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| This is a very organized, very professional money-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| Back in the 70s and 80s, not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| But on Shod Road, my father and Hal Horner built the best track on the East Coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| And I stand by that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| John, Wendy's husband, he's still racing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| He's in his 40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| I got him into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| Now his son's into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| It is an unbelievable sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| It's not hokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| You know, these guys spend lots of money traveling and racing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| And they have multimillion-dollar motorhomes that they travel in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| They fly in teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| Just on a local event here, we would draw from every state around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| It's not just going to be a couple of local yokels out there goofing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| And they're going to spend money in our restaurants, in our hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| They're going to buy gas, just like everybody said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| And they make new friendships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| These kids, it's kind of like your first-tee golf program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| They learn honesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| They learn how to compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| And if you've got a child that's on a football team or a basketball team, they may be benchwarmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| Not in BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Everybody participates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| And it provides such, you know, pride in that child to get out there and race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| And this is not an easy sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I mean, this is you've got to have some talent to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| But the nice thing is the child that may not be as talented as the next one, he's still out there racing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| And he feels good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| And he has a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| His family has a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| And you can go out there on the afternoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| When we had our Chaud Road track where they now have a golf course, you'd go out there any day of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2311)|
| 0:38:40| And if it wasn't raining, there'd be people lined up in their lawn chairs with their children that are practicing BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| And the dads over there are working on their bicycles and tuning them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| And it's just like NASCAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| I mean, it was just you've never been to an event, especially a national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| And we held many nationals out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| And people would come from all over the country because we had the best facility, like I said, on the East Coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2342)|
| 0:39:13| It's great exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| It's, I don't know, camaraderie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| Families get to know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| People move into the area because they like it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| It's a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| And I truly believe that there's some way, somehow, but it's going to take some work to make this thing work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2370)|
| 0:39:40| and make it affordable, because it is affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| Heck, we built that track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| The city didn't pay a penny for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| We built two tracks in this town, Chaud Road being the second and being the best ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| and the city didn't put out a penny for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| All they did was give us the land for a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| We built that thing with volunteers and companies around town donating bulldozers and tractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| And there's people out there that want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| And I think if we work together, it can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| and we can get stuff donated that maybe hadn't even been approached yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2417)|
| 0:40:25| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| You know, I had a BMX business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| I don't remember that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| But I actually had a manufacturing business here in town that created Vector BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| And we, I don't know, we traveled all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2440)|
| 0:40:49| I mean, I had a big team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| And this is very personal to me, especially since my dad did build the first track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| I know I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Well, thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| Mark, if you don't mind, one of our commissioners may have a question for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| or someone else from the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| You spoke of private funding and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| and it sounds like you've been around it for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Is the private funding still available from the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Do we have a specific dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| I've just recently got involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| I would think with social media out there and contacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| people that own companies that have equipment would donate equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| I think it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| It's just you've got to go out and go get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| But we've all got to work together to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Mr. Edwards, is there a specific dollar amount maybe of private funding money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| like Mr. Baumann was talking about, that would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| Because earlier you did make the statement earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| that there were some private funds coming just for bicycles and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| Has anyone been contacted for private funding to help pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| Well, for example, he's talking about trucks and companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| asphalt, different things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| We have several connections and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| I mean, we've got several people that support that are like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| hey, maybe we can help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| We can donate some trucks, asphalt, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| So I do think that definitely those options should be explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| The private funding I was talking about was just other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| that are into mountain biking, biking in general, reached out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| and they want to make donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| I mean, they'd already committed to donations and given money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| so that we could get a fleet of race bikes for these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| that come to the track that maybe can't afford to buy a bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| so that everybody has access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| And we also talked to some organizations that would sponsor a certain number of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| so that they could, for example, when you go in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| and you have like free lunch type thing where you can qualify for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| kids could qualify for these programs and basically race at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| May I make a suggestion of maybe looking and seeing how much private funds you could secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| and then comparing it to the X amount that the project's going to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| and maybe you could send me an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| I can give you my e-mail address and we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| Sure, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| And I think some of the other things that in this whole process with the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| and talking to different people that wanted to donate things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| or talked about donating time, labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| it's really hard because there's been some uncertainty as to whether the project would be finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| at least for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| And so it's really, it's been hard on our end to get definite commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| when we're like, we think we're going to have a track type deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| So that's been some of the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| But we absolutely would be open to exploring what we need to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| to try to make this project happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| I mean, that's our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| I mean, you're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| As we begin to wrap this part of CUP public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| I noticed that both Commissioner Bussler and Commissioner Jay had their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| If you want something, Commissioner Bussler, I believe yours was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2642)|
| 0:44:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| I know this is a public forum, but there's some questions that I would like to get answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| Number one, what stage are we in right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| What does the facility look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| How much money has been spent on it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Do we own the property and are developing it for the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| And if I heard the community right, they're willing to get involved in it and proceed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2668)|
| 0:44:41| But how much money is it going to cost to finish it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| And why did we have such a high figure of, what is it, $500,000 to finish it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2685)|
| 0:44:53| And why are we at this stage right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| This is the last question I'd like to ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| why are we at this stage right now if the community wants it and they could get private funding and finish it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| Are we just going to buy the land for them or what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| Well, Commissioner Bussler, I don't know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| One thing that I think might be useful would be if we have anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| Some of the questions that have come up tonight have been around the bid and the purchasing piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| What I might, and this is, we are kind of going down a long path for public forum, but I know that it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| So what I might ask would be if there's someone from purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| you might want to add some insight to the bid if that's one of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| Could we just do this because it's coming up here and there's so many questions that need to be asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| and then find out where we're going to and what the public is willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| I think if the public is willing to do that private funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| and we can help in some way of getting it started but not fund the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| But the money that we're being asked for to be put in here is, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| a little bit above what anybody would want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| Has the land been, let me ask you this question right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Has the land been bought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Okay, so the county owns the property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| And there's nothing on the property right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| It's a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| I may be able to answer a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| Well, before we get into this, so the property is owned by the county, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| And has there been any construction at all on the track itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| Well, all the dirt has been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| All the dirt is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Okay, now, and how much would you estimate that it would cost to finish it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| Well, this is what I was bringing up earlier, is our request was to get a rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| And the reason for the rebid is because we have contacts with a general contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| who has looked at the designs and can do it in budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| The original budget set forth when they got the plans back from the engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| the cost for the track was just a little over $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| That was not including the ADA, the improvements that had to be made per that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| So the money that you guys had originally allocated, the $750,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| and Carson had requested the line item transfer that we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| let's hold off on that vote because the bid is high, which was a $500,000 line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| We believe, because of the people that we've talked with, USABMX, in getting the rebid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| the track could be built with that additional line item transfer money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| and you would be complete with the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| So that is what we believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| The DNARC bid that came back is at least a million dollars high for what it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2862)|
| 0:47:49| So what are we looking at, the total cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| Of just the track itself or of the whole project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| Of the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| The original budget was the $750,000, and I know Carson had mentioned transferring the $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| It was almost a $500,000 line item, which would have been $1.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| That was the track and everything promised to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| If it came back within the budget that was originally set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| The bid from DNARC came back over a million dollars higher than what USABMX| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| and the engineer that designed the track, they both looked at the bid and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| this is not right, this is too high, this can be done for much less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| which is where we wanted to approach the process to see if it could be rebid, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| Okay, how much less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| You don't know, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| About a million dollars, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| At least a good million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| It would have put it within that $1.25 original set amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| It would have been, it would have fit in that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Which is why we, that's why we asked, we don't, we want to get an accurate bid before we kill the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Chris, can you tell me where we're at right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| And what I might add is we are still in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| It appears it's the will of this body to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| I haven't added this as a formal discussion item for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| But I do want to make sure, while everybody's here, we get some of this done and on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| So, but this is kind of outside the norm for a commission meeting to have a DD built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| By getting to this point right here, why don't we get the questions, get them answered, come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| and let's just find out exactly if, again, like what I normally ask people, is the juice worth the squeezing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| And there's a lot of juice out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| So I don't know where we're spending that taxpayer's dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| That's the problem that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| And how much can we get returned on that money for those tax dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| So instead of taking up any more of this forum's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| can we just not make an additional item down the road and then put these questions out and have them answered for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=2994)|
| 0:50:03| I think that might be a more efficient use of all of our times and we'd be able to get better answers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| Knoxville is obviously a very booming town now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| This would be a good time if we want to invest in this while we are booming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| Sir, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| What I'd like to do is, I have not yet recognized you, but I do want to recognize my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker and then Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| Just a suggestion, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Why don't we defer this as a Chairman's Briefing session that you could schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| and have all of the parties from finance and the BMX people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| and then we can just do it as a Chairman's Briefing because this is. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| It's a long one, and I'll take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| I think since the questions of the bids have been asked and PBA's work has been questioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| I think we should at least let PBA be able to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| I agree, and I saw Mr. Caldwell as someone from PBA or the bidding company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| What I'd like to do is, if you could speak to that item, the bid itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| and then we will schedule a more detailed formal discussion at this in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| when we can get the questions, everything in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| and be a little more intentional outside of public forum and have a scheduled discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| What I'd like to do is recognize Mr. Caldwell and PBA on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3093)|
| 0:51:41| You've got 30 seconds, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| My name is Betsy Pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| I live at 2009 Woodson Drive, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| I live in South Knoxville, obviously, but I write for Knox 10 Today, the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| It's something that is being bandied about and that strikes me as being confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| The reason that BMX was drawn to this property to begin with is there is a stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| with a running track and an infield sitting unused at the bottom of South Doyle Middle School's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3128)|
| 0:52:17| because the school was built as a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| Built as a middle school, there was no need for that stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| So when this group came up with this idea, it seemed very logical to be able to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| Meanwhile, because this is such a big campus, there are lands next to the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| right next to the school, not a quarter mile down the driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| that are accessed directly by doors from the gymnasium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| which is also an epically large basketball arena for a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| Anyway, there are two fields now, a football field and a practice field, that have been leveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| They are ready to go. They're waiting for sod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| There's a scoreboard that's going to be placed there that was at the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| the Pete Stafford scoreboard that was memorialized to the great coach, Pete Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| They're waiting on the sod. They're doing some fencing to make it safe for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| And they're going to put in a concession stand, which for some reason is going to cost $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| which most of us in the South Knoxville community do not understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| But they have what they need there except for a track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| And if you rope off or fence off the stadium, which can't be accessed by anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| you could still do the infield, which is a big pile of dirt now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| And if you go on Knox 10 today, you can see pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| There is also a track that was in terrible shape before they started moving dirt down there from those upper fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| And the track needs to be resurfaced to modern technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| And I think that that school deserves that much money at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| The people in BMX do not require stadium seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| They go to beats around the country and sit in their sport chairs that they take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| So leaving the stadium itself out of the equation is no problem for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| There will be a need for restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| But otherwise, you're talking about all they need is that big pile of dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| and the kids only need a track around the infield so that they can run their races and have track meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3261)|
| 0:54:29| That's all they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| All right. Thank you, Ms. Pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Go ahead, Mr. Caldwell, PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| So what happened was the county and the mayor, we asked PBA to take over the project as it relates to BMX and the upper field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3278)|
| 0:54:49| And so we split those projects between the upper fields and BMX and then had PBA to do an RFP for the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3289)|
| 0:55:00| And so when that RFP was done, I think it was in September, there was a required pre-bid meeting that was set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3300)|
| 0:55:09| Nobody who was a licensed contractor in the state of Tennessee showed up for the pre-bid meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| And it was a required pre-bid meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| So at that point, the RFP is canceled because you have missed the required pre-bid meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| At that point, we had PBA to use one of their term contractors to provide us a quote on the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3325)|
| 0:55:34| They used an art construction and formed an art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| They needed to work with one of two or three licensed track builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| That is related to BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| So that is where our documents come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| It comes from DNARC working with pump tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| And so we got that quote back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| And the quote for the base track is $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| And so that is when we sat down and made a determination that basically we had $750,000 that was budgeted for both projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3368)|
| 0:56:18| We think the upper field is about $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| So we had the remaining for BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| We talked about doing a line item transfer for the 4985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| We held off on that because we wanted to see what that quote came back at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| And so that is kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| And so you have got a base track of $1.5 million, plus we have additional add-ons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3401)|
| 0:56:49| I could get it up to $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| And we are sitting there with a budget of $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3412)|
| 0:57:00| I mean, there is not an additional appropriation for the remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| And so the mayor and us, we sat down and came up with a plan to make the school whole as it relates to anything to do with the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3425)|
| 0:57:19| and for any inconvenience, which includes the track, shop foot, long jump, I think it was the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| And that is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| And so there was, from the appropriation that the commission made for BMX,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3449)|
| 0:57:36| there is not enough money to do the upper fields and BMX as it relates to the quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| And we can question the quote if we want to, but, I mean, there is contract documents to back it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3463)|
| 0:57:52| And we used Sintex, which is one of the people, one of the groups that they recommend that you use for the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3472)|
| 0:58:02| And so that is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| And so, I mean, you can re-bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| I mean, we could say re-bid, but when you have a required pre-bid meeting and nobody shows up to bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3488)|
| 0:58:17| why go back through that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| That was the longest 30 seconds of this vehicle I have ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| I am just kidding you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Do you understand now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| All I was asking for is, hey, we could have gone in the chairman's briefing and taken care of all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| From this point on out, we have got this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| The one thing I would want to know, I think we have got, you said, what, half a million dollars already invested in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3522)|
| 0:58:50| Is it 400 or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| How much have you got on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| So here is the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| The majority of that 500,000 has been spent on the upper fields, not BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| The piece that was spent on BMX was the 80,000 that was related to design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| Everything else was spent on the upper fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| Jim Snowden has his number of 326,000, which basically moved the dirt, which created the upper fields, down to the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3548)|
| 0:59:19| We have not spent 500,000 on BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| You are talking about the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| Okay, we have got money invested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| I would like to see and stop this discussion right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| and come back here at the chairman's briefing and say, okay, here is the dollar it is going to cost us to finish it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| and let the public have their input and see what they can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| And if it comes out reasonable, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| If it is not, then we have to make a decision to, I guess, what would you call it, cut bait and run, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3586)|
| 0:59:58| So for right now, I think the discussion for what I want to hear is over for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| So could we have another time for another meeting and have the public come and tell us what they can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| I think that I will take that into consideration and look at our schedule and see if we can work that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Mr. Chairman, we are an hour into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| I would like to kind of move on from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| I mean, we are going to sit here and go back and forth, and we are not going to solve anything tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| We are going to add to the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| So I think we should cut the bait off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| I mean, I think the community is passionate about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| The commission would like to see a resolution, and I think it is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| But we are not going to do anything further than create more confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| I would like for us to get everybody's questions in order in print, get them answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| and then have a meeting and a community discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I don't think we are going to get anything accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| We are an hour into the meeting on item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| So, as chair, what I would like to do is move on on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| I also want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| In a way, this kind of reminds me of a zoning item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| I think it is very important to make sure that people are heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| and I think we have been fair to everyone to make sure that your points have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| But at this point, we do need to move forward with discussion and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| So with that said, the next person on public forum is Clayton Wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| Clayton apologizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| He had an incident come up and he will not appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| Moving forward, Liza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| I may have said it wrong again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| Everyone does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| It's Liza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Liza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Sorry, Liza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| If you could name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| It's Liza Ransom Dodson, and it's 7080 Leopard Way, and that is 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| I'm a teacher at Lonsdale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| Tonight, I'm not here to harp on Lonsdale's existing challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| such as our building's ADA accessibility, lack of sprinklers, the prevalent mold and consistent flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| or even the fact that we are losing positions that will lead to increased class sizes next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| These issues have already been brought to our school board's attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| but tonight I'm here to talk about issues that are even more serious and urgent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| which are Lonsdale's unique overcrowding situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| and the safety issues our students and staff have repeatedly faced this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| Let me begin with our overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Lonsdale understands that we are not the only school in Knox County with overcrowded halls or students learning in portables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| but we are the only school that has been split without a new building to ease that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| When our community became overcrowded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| the students displaced from Lonsdale weren't given a new school that adequately meets their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| Our kindergartners and first graders are being forced into a former preschool that is too small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| lacks the resources they require, and has put a strain on families by dividing students between two schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| And that's what sets Lonsdale's overcrowding apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| We were promised a temporary solution that would provide equal services while also leaving our community intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| and the sad reality is we are only able to interact with the staff and students there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| after we are forced to evacuate to Sammy Hill when there's a gas leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| This leads me to a much bigger issue, safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| Day-to-day safety is something that our school alone faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| No other school in this county has had four gas leaks this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| I'll be honest, I had a hard time thinking about how to eloquently convey these safety issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| because I cannot believe a permanent solution hasn't already been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| As I stand here and advocate for a new school building, I find myself at a loss for words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| But here are the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Our students and staff have been put in four separate occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| where they either were or could have been in a place of learning while breathing in carbon monoxide and natural gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| Staff members have had carbon monoxide poisoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| and have been taken to the hospital after being exposed to these toxic conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| These emergencies were addressed as isolated incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| and were given a quick fix so that we could reenter the building as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| But now, four emergencies later, we're all left waiting for the next crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| and we'll continue to do so these last three months of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| Bottom line, no other families in this county worry about sending their children, their parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| or pregnant wives into a building with fear that their loved ones might have irreversible damage to their health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3857)|
| 1:04:23| from an environment as inadequate and downright dangerous as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| And truthfully, I don't know what to say to a parent who looks me in the eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| and asks me as their child's teacher, is it safe for my child to come to school today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| Because I was able to reassure my families after the first carbon monoxide incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| and even after the second gas leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| But after the third and the fourth just last week, I'm just genuinely at a loss for words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| The staff at Lonsdale knows that every school in Knox County has needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| and that budget funding can only meet so many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| We know that there are schools in this county who also face overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| But as dedicated educators, it's frustrating when the needs of other schools are being handled proactively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| and issues as severe as Lonsdale's are handled reactively, or aren't even handled reactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| We know that the school board plans to put Lonsdale on its capital plan for improvements to be implemented in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| Frankly, we don't have that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| To not take immediate action in light of the safety concerns and inequities in Lonsdale is beneath us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| We are better than this, and I'm here tonight to ask you, our county commissioners, what else can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| How can we find a solution that promises our students the learning environment that they deserve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| I'll end with a quote from Lonsdale Elementary's mission statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| which is recited every morning by all the students and staff in the building, and it's hanging up in all of our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| The first line says, Lonsdale is a safe place where we are all unique and valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| All of us who learn and work at Lonsdale deserve a safe space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| but after all we've been through, I don't know how much longer the staff at Lonsdale can confidently believe in these words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| When students are in danger time and time again in an environment that we put them in, we are responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| And this incredible community can no longer afford to not be prioritized on the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| We cannot afford to live and learn in this building until 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| And that is why I'm here today, actively and desperately seeking the advice and counsel of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| Okay, next I've got Angel Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| My name is Angel Bowman, 1719 Connecticut Avenue, Knoxville 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| And like I said, my name is Angel Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| I'm here tonight as a concerned parent of two beautiful boys who currently attend Lonsdale Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| and I represent Lonsdale community members who are here with me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| As many of you know, Lonsdale Elementary was forced to evacuate last November due to carbon monoxide poisoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| My sons walked with their teachers and classmates in 30-degree pouring down rain from Lonsdale to Sammy Hill because their school was filled with toxic gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4021)|
| 1:07:10| As a parent, I was terrified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| I took my kids to the doctor and was told to watch for possible flu-like symptoms over the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| And let me tell you, everything looked like flu-like symptoms over the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| After the carbon monoxide leak, we were told that the issue had been fixed and that the school would be safe for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4043)|
| 1:07:30| In February, there was another leak at the school, this time natural gas in the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| Fortunately, school was already closed due to sickness that day, but if it hadn't been for the closure, kids would have been at the school that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| teachers would have been at the school, and they would have been breathing in toxic gas again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| Last week, I got a call from Principal Dill saying that there was another gas leak, again natural gas, again in the school's kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4067)|
| 1:07:55| They said that the building was safe and that the school would remain open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| That day, I checked my boys out and took them home because I wasn't taking another chance with their safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| And I'm glad that I did because the next morning, I received another call saying that there was yet again another gas leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4084)|
| 1:08:13| This time, they closed the school due to an abundance of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| At this point, I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| My sons go to a school that is no longer safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| I'll let that sink in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| My boys go to a school that is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| While my boys are at school where they're supposed to be learning in a safe environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| I'm at home wondering if the air that they're breathing is safe, and I'm scared for their safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| The school system said the leaks at Lonsdale were small and that they had been fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| But let me tell you, as a parent, there is no such thing as a minor gas leak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| Toxic air is toxic air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| And when this happens not once, not twice, not three times, but four times in less than 90 days, the issue has not been fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4129)|
| 1:08:58| The issue is that Lonsdale Elementary is no longer safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| Our students and our teachers have been complaining about the air quality at the school for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| You can literally feel how wet the area is in the school when you walk into Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| You can see water stains on the ceilings of the classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| You can feel mildew on the textbooks, and you can even see mold on the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| And this is the school my kids go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| Last year, I helped a group of parents serve lunch for the Teacher Appreciation Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| We served lunch in the basement because the school doesn't even have enough space for a teacher's lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| And what I saw in the basement shocked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| I could see mildew on the walls, and I could feel how wet the textbooks on the shelves were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| And these are the books that my sons read in their class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| Flooding has been an issue at Lonsdale for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Our students complain of sickness that has been going on at Lonsdale for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| Overcrowding has been an issue in Lonsdale for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| But now it's not about poor learning conditions, not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| Now it's about safety, the safety of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| I'm here tonight because I don't know where else to go or who else to turn to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| We are asking the school board to make Lonsdale a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| But I want to ask you tonight to tell me what more I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| Raise my taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Tell me who to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| Tell me who to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| Because we can't wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| We can't wait for the leak that no one catches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| We can't wait for the first injury or death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| We can't wait while our school continues to fall apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| We owe it to our kids to act now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Lonsdale has to be a priority for everyone in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| So, please, please help me make Lonsdale a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| Help me make our kids and their safety a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4239)|
| 1:10:45| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| If Mr. Thomas is here or Mr. Oaks, I think I have a few questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4247)|
| 1:10:57| I know that Superintendent Thomas is not here, so I think you've got Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| It's spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4262)|
| 1:11:13| Mr. Oaks, you know, I guess we only heard of these second or third or third or fourth incidences as a body, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4273)|
| 1:11:21| as commissioners, and that came from outside the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| Has there been done to repair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| I mean, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| My real concern is the gas leak in the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Are we using gas heat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| Are we using the stoves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Is there any flame in the kitchen that would cause us to fear a gas leak and flame coming together in the kitchen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4296)|
| 1:11:44| We have one gas oven in the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| That's the only appliance that we have in the kitchen that is gas fired at Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| With respect to the gas leaks, I'm only aware of what we've got in our maintenance system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4312)|
| 1:12:00| We had a report on February the 7th of a gas leak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| and maintenance responded to that and was unable to identify any leak at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| We had another call last Tuesday morning about 6 a.m. from the cafeteria manager that there was a leak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| and maintenance and KUB and the fire department responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| and identified what they described to me as a small leak in a coupling at that point, and that was repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4343)|
| 1:12:32| And then later that day, our maintenance supervisor sent the night shift by Lonsdale to inspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4352)|
| 1:12:41| and make sure we still had no problem, and at that point they identified the presence of gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| So that evening we replaced all of the gas pipe that services the kitchen at Lonsdale Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4367)|
| 1:12:54| and we've not had a detection since that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| So one day nobody found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| The next day they found it and fixed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| The next time they had to, or not the next day, but the next incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| So you found it and didn't, or you reported it, couldn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| Found it, fixed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| Found it again and had to fix it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| How do we get to the comfortable space that we're fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| And number two, another question is, on that building and the moisture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| and if a parent has complained, I don't know if a parent has complained to the school or to the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| if they have, have they done any kind of mold testing in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| First, I can tell you that we have replaced all of the gas service piping for the kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| and all of the couplings and everything that links the range up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| and have detected no presence of gas since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| So I think we've done what we can do at that point where that's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| We've addressed moisture issues in the basement at Lonsdale a number of times over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| and put in some remediation or addressed it with some remediation activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| in order to try to keep the water out, in order to also get the water out if it gets in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| I believe we've installed a sump pump over there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| So we've met with more or less success depending on how much water we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| And in recent weeks we've had an awful lot of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Has a parent contacted the system to complain about mold or mildew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| I haven't looked that up specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| but I can and I can share that with you and see if we have done any environmental testing for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4477)|
| 1:14:46| If you find a complaint from a parent, I'd like to know if you have or have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| And also, if you have, I'd like to know what remediation or testing you have done on that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| Because I think we, you know, we're quick to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| You know, in our district we're fast growing and we needed schools, we built them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| And I've said for years that our inner city schools that we inherited from the city school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| are going to require massive dollar amounts in the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| And this may just be the very start of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| But I'm kind of alarmed that we had a gas leak in a school that we didn't repair quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| And if that was my child, I don't know that I would be as calm as the community has been about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4520)|
| 1:15:29| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| In order for the lights to confirm, I see Commissioner Gill followed by Bussler, then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| So, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Could you determine whether or not the school system installed carbon monoxide detectors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4539)|
| 1:15:46| Did we put any into the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| Subsequent to the carbon monoxide leak in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| we retrofitted the school with carbon monoxide detectors at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| And what letter was sent to the parents and the community regarding the incident that occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4561)|
| 1:16:08| Was anything mailed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| I don't know what the school administration may have communicated on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| Not the school administration, the school system itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| I'm not aware of anything that went directly from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| They would have gone through the school administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| I've talked to some people that work in the gas industry and do repair work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| Are the people, you used your own maintenance people, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| Is that Mr. Oat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4601)|
| 1:16:48| We have HVAC technicians on staff that do gas work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| and we use our own people to do work inside our buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| The utility companies do the work up to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| Now, my question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| I had a water heater installed in my house just about three or four months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| and this technician that installed it came back with this machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| I don't know what he was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| He was running it all up and down each of the connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| and it could detect at least a little bit of detection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Do you all have those type of instruments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| And that's what our team uses, a sniffer device,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| in order to try to identify if we have gas leaks at any particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| We're also looking now into the viability of a laser type device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| that would help detect gas in much smaller quantities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| Well, that's the one that he used was this one that would just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| the most minute leak would be detected by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| And when you just said you're looking into getting that device,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| it seems like that would be a priority to get for your team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| and I hope you get it sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| I don't see our superintendent here, and I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| I would love to ask our superintendent and maybe our school board chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| why this school has not been a greater priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| That may be an easy answer for them to say it's simply money, but this seems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| and thank you, Mr. Oaks, I don't have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| I don't want to keep you at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| I know this is a school board issue to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| but it's a commission issue as a public safety issue thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| and our investment in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| I've visited Lonsdale School several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| and frankly I'm embarrassed that this is a center of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| that we call part of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| I'm amazed when I see rat droppings throughout the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| when I see mold on the walls, when I see obvious areas of flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| little to no infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| I saw one of our students sitting on a bucket, a Home Depot bucket as a chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| and it made me sad to walk away from that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| and think this is where we send our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| and we wonder why they're not excelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| And I know this is one of many issues with Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| but we've got to figure out a way to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| And I agree with the teachers that are out in the front row and the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| that sitting here waiting until 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| I think we're waiting to bury a child or a teacher before then if we wait that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| These are major structural issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| These are major infrastructure issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| This is a school that was built in the 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| Let that sink in for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| A school that was built in the 30s that we're patching up and hoping for the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| And I hope that the school board, when they do their budget, I hope our mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| our commission, I hope our community looks at this school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| looks at a few other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| and say we have decided to prioritize our investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| And I know we're going to talk about that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| but this is something that we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| I just wanted to lend my opinion to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| I don't have any great solutions today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| but I appreciate you coming to talk to us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| and I appreciate that you would keep your voices loud and let's talk about solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| How we got here is one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| but what we're going to do next is going to really define who we are as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| and I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| This concludes tonight's opening meeting public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| At this point in the meeting, for those of you who are going to be staying later or watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| this is the point of the meeting where we set the agenda for the rest of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| To our guests, to my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| this has been, frankly, a different meeting or a different start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| As chair, I've got the discretion to allow these types of conversations to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| even though it's part of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| I think all of this was appropriate, much like a, once again, kind of like a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| We know when we're handling zoning how important it is for people to get their points across and to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| And for all of you who came to speak tonight, we're grateful for all of you being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4898)|
| 1:21:45| For all of us, for the community, it helps everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| As we move into setting the agenda, I reviewed some of these on the commissioner's forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| and then I did have one other item that came in late this afternoon that I recently had Drusilla send out to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| Tonight we're going to be, we need to formally add item 28 and item 36 to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4922)|
| 1:22:12| Another item that I'd like to add as a brief item to discuss is a discussion regarding our budget timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4932)|
| 1:22:22| We always have a meeting, usually it's the first week in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| where we will have our formal meeting where we actually vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| So, I would like to include that as a discussion item if the discussion takes place either tonight or at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4949)|
| 1:22:36| I'd like to get that accomplished this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Item number 12, which came from our school board, is going to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4959)|
| 1:22:48| Otherwise, the non-consent items, and I will say this twice, are items 7, 21, 22, 23, 26, 28, 29, 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4968)|
| 1:23:14| 32, 33, 34, 35, and 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=4994)|
| 1:23:25| Also, some additional clarification as we set tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| As a matter of routine at every meeting, I've noticed that we always, as a matter of routine, routinely approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| taking over the water, the flood water management of new developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| I anticipate as all of those items continue to be approved, but as I posted on the forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| I would like Jim Snowden to talk to that in light of our recent flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| just to talk to that as a subject matter in general of when we approve those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| what exactly are we approving and what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| I think that's important for the public to address as a general item because I know all of those we are going to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5038)|
| 1:24:05| Another one that was just emailed out to you all, that someone contacted me this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| was regarding the transportation district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5050)|
| 1:24:17| I've sent that over to the law department and I afforded that on to all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| and I know that it's something that our legislative committee should probably take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| It seems as if the bill number on that corresponded more to one of last year's bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| Joel, I see you're on the board of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| This really came to us kind of late today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| What I'd like to do is I'll give you just kind of like a very, I've said 30 seconds twice tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5078)|
| 1:24:45| and people have run over and I know you've been at these kind of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| but as we add this on for consideration, this is something we'll have to put some thought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| If you don't mind staying a little bit later, public forum is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| but we'll add this as a brief discussion item just so that you can give some direction to our legislative committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5100)|
| 1:25:08| which we'll be looking at this item this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| We're not going to be voting on it, but we just got the item today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| There will need to be some follow-up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| That's fine, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize for the misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| or miscommunication that caused this, but I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| So we'll be adding a discussion item at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| and this commission can choose to move that forward to next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| or we can handle it tonight depending on how we're doing on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| With that said, is there any additions that any of my fellow commissioners would like to pull from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| Yes, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| I don't want to pull from consent, but I would like to join as a sponsor of number 26, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5144)|
| 1:25:59| Okay. I'll read that one out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| The commission item number 26, which I want to thank Commissioner Smith for, and we'll get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| That was the item regarding naming of the library in honor of Lynn Redmond, and we'll get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Any other changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| To save a little time at the end, I want to take just a couple of minutes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| Could I have the two people that are from the Parks and Rec here tonight stand up and come down and introduce yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| I want you to get familiar with these two people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| because we're probably not going to talk about my discussion item tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| but I want you to look at these two people right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| Where's the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| These people, when they get up here, we had a long discussion last Thursday with Paul White being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5210)|
| 1:27:02| and he can't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| But they came down here anyway to see this discussion, and I don't want to hold them here any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| But they helped out quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| And I'm going to tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| I have in my hand here about Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| They're not getting their forms back from the people that are leasing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| You've heard my concern about people leasing the ball fields and what they've done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| And I'm going to tell you what I found out, and I'm going to have Paul here the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| He had to be out of town on a, I guess, to go to take someone to a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| Would it be easier to have Paul speak to this next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| And I'm going to speak to this right now, because this needs to be audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| And I may ask for this, and you will have this information before you next time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| probably next month, to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| But these people are really working hard, and they need to be recognized in some of the things that have happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| We really need to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| And I'm going to make sure that tonight we postpone this until next month to where Paul can be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| and let him explain what's going on with these fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| So, as far as setting our agenda, Commissioner Bussler's discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| we will move forward to next month while we have some of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5298)|

| 1:29:32| Do I have a motion for approval of the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5374)|

| 1:29:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| Item number seven, resolution 202, is to approve a contract with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5389)|
| 1:29:56| for the receipt of funds in the amount of $24,611 for activities associated with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| Student Spaceflight Experiments Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| Resolution 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| I was the one who actually pulled this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| It was a relatively short list of items for the schools, and frankly, this sounded like a pretty interesting program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5409)|
| 1:30:15| Is there anybody from schools to let us know about this fascinating program that we're working out on with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| University of Tennessee regarding student spaceflight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5422)|
| 1:30:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| My name is Cheryl Martin, and I'm a Knox County Schools employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| So number seven is these funds that we'll receive are for the Student Spaceflight Experiment Program by covering the travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5447)|
| 1:31:02| and the related costs of the top three experiment design teams and two mission patch winners from Knox County Schools to Cape Canaveral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5462)|
| 1:31:11| The students are traveling to watch the launch of the mission patches and the winning experiment from Career Magnet to the International Space Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5471)|
| 1:31:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| That's pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| It's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| Any commissioners have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| That's a great way to teach STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| I just read the book years ago and had my son sit down and watch the movie Rocket Boys about this, and that's a great way to inspire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5490)|
| 1:31:40| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| It's an awesome opportunity for the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| You brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| I do need a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| Motion's been made by Commissioner Beeler, and the second was Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| You're throwing me off here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Get in your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5526)|
| 1:32:07| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5527)|
| 1:32:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5531)|
| 1:32:12| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| Madam Clerk has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| These are all going to be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| To clarify what we're doing is all of those engineering requests are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| However, as I posted in forum, we approve these as a matter of routine at every single meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5548)|
| 1:32:36| I thought in light of all of the recent flooding that we've had, something about seeing something related to stormwater facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5556)|
| 1:32:44| and best practices as it relates to approving and bringing into the county these stormwater drains and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| It seemed like an appropriate time to ask Jim to provide us some insight to something that we do as a matter of routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| And frankly, some of us may not have given it that much thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| So, Jim, if you could go ahead and provide some insights of these, which we approve at every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| Be glad to, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| We do inundate your all's agenda with these monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| Unfortunately, what they are is it's a covenant for maintenance for permanent stormwater facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5592)|
| 1:33:20| What those typically are, what you see is detention basins, swells, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5600)|
| 1:33:26| What it is is essentially before we issue a grading permit to the landowner to construct their development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5606)|
| 1:33:33| they're required to execute this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| It gives us the right to ensure that those devices, detention basins, swells,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| and any of those engineered best management practices are maintained by the landowners in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5621)|
| 1:33:49| If the landowner chooses not to do that, it also gives us the right to go upon that property to ensure that the safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5629)|
| 1:33:56| welfare, and safety of the public is taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| So, that's essentially what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| They're all essentially mandated by the NPDES permit in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| That permit overreaches us, and then our stormwater ordinance is required upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| So, actually, these are things that are required by the state NPDES permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| and further required as of our stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| Any of my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Well, I wanted to point out a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| Overall, I think if you looked at the new developments, the flooding that we had through all the rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| most of the damage or most of the harm was done in the older developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| that didn't have these stipulations and regulations on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| So, a lot of what we built recently really held up to a pretty good downpour, minus a few areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5681)|
| 1:34:49| But it was older developments that we saw where people were boxed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| It was in Cedar Bluff under the old plans and all that other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| So, I think what we're doing now is obviously working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| Our detention requirements changed in the early 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| Prior to that point, we were only detaining the 10-year storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| and now we actually detain the 100-year storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| So, there is a lot of flood abatement that's additional to these new ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| So, you're exactly right, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| There was less flooding in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Do any of my fellow commissioners have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| Motion from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| And a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5735)|
| 1:35:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| We're on Item Number 21, Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| It's regarding the issuance of not to exceed $36 million general obligation bonds of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5742)|
| 1:35:49| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| We have a motion to consent without recommendation from Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| with a second from Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| The intent of your motion is to have the discussion next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| I'd like to have a discussion right now with Chris, and then send without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| because there's still a lot to read on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| I also want to clarify for my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| There were three items related to this bond issuance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| and we'll have to have three separate votes for all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| However, as it relates to the discussion on this, I'd like to have one discussion, if that is pleasing to this Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| So, we have a proper motion and second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| Before the vote, we now will engage in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| So, Chris, if you could approach the stand, please, to share with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| I think I also saw Mr. Ayers in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5799)|
| 1:36:52| Just in general, what this is related to, the first item is related to the first two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5812)|
| 1:37:02| ones like they make us do two separate resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| It's just related to the 2019 capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| So, we're just issuing bonds for the capital plan that you all approved back in May or June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5829)|
| 1:37:17| And the total amount of bonds we anticipate issuing is $35,415,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| Just for the resolution, Mamentoff just rounds up, just to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5843)|
| 1:37:31| And so, the first two that you have that show $36 million is actually the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5851)|
| 1:37:37| So, there's only one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| We just got to do it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| And then, the third one, which we can get to on Monday, next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| is a refunding of some bonds where we can save about $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| as long as we come on securities year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| just as long as when we price that on the estimate that the market's not increased at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5875)|
| 1:38:02| And so, that's kind of a summary of the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| So, the first two are just related to the capital plan that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| And the third one is just a chance for us to save some money on interest by doing a refunding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5888)|
| 1:38:17| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Yeah, Chris, on that refunding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| So, if we go to market and it doesn't save anything, do they fail to execute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| We just don't execute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| And what does it cost us to save this $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| Is that total savings or is it, I mean, somebody's making money executing the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| So, by rolling it into the bond issue and not the answer, we save on the cost issue of the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5915)|
| 1:38:43| How much money were we rolling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| What are we rolling in there to borrow and save this $200,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| The amount of those bonds that we owe is about $13,900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| And so, we think we'll get like a true interest rate cost of about 2.02%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5935)|
| 1:39:05| So, we're going to clear $200,000 with the money we're, but what are we paying the bonding company to save this $200,000 is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5945)|
| 1:39:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| So, there's closing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| This is not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| They're not doing it out of the kindness of their heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| And so, Mr. Ayers, would you please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5960)|
| 1:39:33| I'm Joseph Ayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| I represent Commonwealth Securities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| We've done issuances for you all for a number of years and generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| The savings of about $225,000 is net of all the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| And what we are actually doing with this issuance, because you are raising new money, is combining those closing costs, if that makes sense to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5988)|
| 1:39:57| So, regardless, most of the stuff that's being incurred, whether it be the bond resolution, the rating calls, our fee itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=5997)|
| 1:40:05| they're all combined into that new money issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| And so, there's just a little bit extra when it comes to the refunding, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| Okay, yes, it does make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| These bonds that we are reissuing were issued in 2010, I guess, from what I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| And I just got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| I haven't had a chance to dive into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| But they all are maturing between 19 and 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| I think you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| And in essence, you're saying we're going to – how long will these bond issues be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| So, in a refunding, we are not extending the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| We are keeping it at a maturity for maturity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| Okay, so we're keeping the same maturity debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| Just lowering the interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| Lowering the interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Commissioner Smith, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| Yes, Mr. Caldwell, so if we move forward with both of these bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| and we do our April payments and June payments on existing bond debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| will our then total debt be back to the 2011 levels, which is about 690 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6075)|
| 1:41:28| Total bonded debt will be around 650.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| If we include the leases and loans, it's about 680.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| So those have a source of payment that pays for themselves, so we always show them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| But as far as a liability, they are a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| But as far as bonded indebtedness, it's about 650.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| Do any other commissioners have any questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| Okay, what we have before us is a motion to extend forward with no recommendation on the first one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| which I believe was number 21 on your agenda, R-19-3-801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| So we will need – I do not see any – John, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| Do you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| We will vote on each one of these and the suggested recommendation from the chairs to send forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| with no recommendation on each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| So on the first one, item 21, that motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| Okay. All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| 22 is Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| It's authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $36 million in one or more series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| making provision for the issuance, sale and payment of said bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| establishing the terms thereof and the disposition and proceeds therefrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| and providing for the levy of taxes for the payment of principal of premium, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| and interest on the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6188)|

| 1:49:21| I should be under five minutes, and this is our shelter medical director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| which should also be under five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| I'm here tonight supporting a proposed ordinance to institute a community cat diversion program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| that will directly and significantly impact the overpopulation of free-roaming cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6576)|
| 1:49:42| Community cat diversion has been proven to be successful in more than 650 jurisdictions around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| And we are, in fact, the largest county in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| not practicing the only proven best practice of population control through a comprehensive program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| to include shelter, neuter, vaccinate, return, trap, neuter, vaccinate, return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| outreach and conflict resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| This is not just about decreasing the intake of cats into the shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| This is about solving a community issue through spay-neuter practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| and is the single best solution to both significantly reducing the overall population of free-roaming cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6612)|
| 1:50:18| and decreasing the impact on the ecosystem as well as the wildlife population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| This issue is not whether free-roaming cats can have negative impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| The issue is how we can lower their numbers and reduce whatever negative impacts there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| Over the last three years at Young-Williams, we took in 8,735 cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6632)|
| 1:50:37| Of that, only 381 or 4% were reunited with an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| Of that 8735, 3381 were euthanized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| That's 39%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| A trapping-euthanized approach simply doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| The rate of reproduction of cats is so significant that there will never be a point of which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| through a euthanasia method, the cat population will decrease but instead is shown to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| And given the birth rate of humans at 10,000 a day and cats and puppies at 70,000 a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6664)|
| 1:51:11| there simply will never be enough homes for these animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| lest we take great strides in practicing sterilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| We'd love for all cats to be kept inside, absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| educate and promote responsible pet ownership to adopters when they come to our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| Unfortunately, indoor cats is not a reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| and an enormous number of community cats are not owned and are cared for by multiple people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| By returning these cats to their place of origin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| friendly neighborhood cats have a 70% to 100% chance of finding their way back home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| and being reunited with their owner or owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| While there hasn't been a reported cat case of rabies in Knox County since 1969,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| public health remains of utmost concern for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| As part of this program, all cats would be released back to their original habitat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| having been rabies vaccinated and dewormed, sending them back healthier than when they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| This will increase community immunity, decrease the number of community cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| and end the use of euthanasia for population control of cats in a shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| A position statement by the American Public Health Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| and its Veterinary Public Health Special Interest Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| which focuses on preventing the spread of zoonotic diseases from animals to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| such as rabies and taxoplasmosis, states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| we encourage communities to discuss trap-neuter-return as a management practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6752)|
| 1:52:38| to control community cats and to adopt this practice where possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| The American Bar Association and International Association of City and County Managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| have also issued similar position statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| Even trap-and-remove is completely ineffective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| as that's also been what shelters have practiced for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| We are expending resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| We are wasting taxpayer dollars by holding cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| treating them for shelter-related stress and illnesses like upper respiratory infection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| which often leads to euthanasia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| In fact, the cost to taxpayers every year to impound, shelter, kill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| and dispose of unwanted animals is roughly $2 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| We need to reserve space in the shelters for those animals that truly have nowhere else to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6800)|
| 1:53:27| which include those cats that are also unhealthy, that are too young,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6807)|
| 1:53:34| or have also been known to live outdoors or indoors their entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| These cats are not eligible for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| The goal of all of us here tonight is fewer cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| The goal of any cat management policy is to effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| and humanely reduce the number of free-roaming cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| improve the health and safety of the community, and reduce the impact on wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| This responsible program has been proven time and time again to be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| and decrease the populations of cats across hundreds of communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| That's why I ask that you vote yes on this ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| It's what's best for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| It's what's best for the cats as well as the birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| Lisa Chassie, and I live at 822.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| You can just say Young-Williams there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| Well, Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| I do live in Knox County, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| I want to start by thanking everyone for their time and attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| to this topic of trap-neuter release with vaccination being an important part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| I've been a member of the veterinary community in Knoxville and Knox County since 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| I've worked in private practice in spay-neuter clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| and in shelter medicine since 2005 at Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| I've served as the president of the Knoxville Veterinary Medical Association from 2001 to 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6888)|
| 1:54:54| and I'm their representative on the city animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| I have a master's degree in epidemiology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| I've worked to help decrease the number of unwanted pets in our community for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| I've also worked as an animal control officer for a short time in Illinois while I was in veterinary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| So I understand this issue from many sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| and that background has basically got me to my current view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| which is that trap-and-remove and euthanize does not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| It's ineffective in reducing the number of feral cats in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| and stray cats in the community, it's a waste of time and money for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| Cats are there because there's something to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| There's shelter. There's food. There's water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| There's a reason that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| So merely taking them away is a temporary fix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| and animal control officers will tell you if they trap out a group of cats within six months, more will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| It's because there's something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| Since we can't get rid of all the potential food sources for cats in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| I think it's better to focus on sterilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| Without sterilization or return, new cats move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| TNVR returns cats to where they came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| Now they're vaccinated and healthier, and they can continue to occupy that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| Yes, if there's places where they're not welcome, you can use deterrents to help usher them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| But trap-and-remove and euthanize is reactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| and sterilization that we're proposing is proactive and preventative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| According to the Million Cat Challenge, I think Janet's already mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| many communities have adopted this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| The only thing they say is, we wish we'd done it sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| In 2007, Young-Williams launched the Spay Shuttle to remove all barriers to spay and neuter for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6991)|
| 1:56:38| thanks to the help of many organizations and grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| This program has resulted in significant decline in shelter intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| We have essentially reached a plateau with cat intake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| and that's because cats are just amazing survivors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| One female cat can have up to three litters with an average of six kittens in each litter in a single season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| The first litter can start having its own litter before the end of that breeding season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7019)|
| 1:57:04| So it's easy to see how you can go from one cat to 20 very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7024)|
| 1:57:10| So sterilization is the way to kind of just nip that in the bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| Some people express a concern that TNR is irresponsible pet ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| Well, many of these cats really aren't pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| and I think it's also important to note that when people see that trap-neuter-release is something that should be done for ferals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7044)|
| 1:57:31| it might reinforce the message of how important it is for every cat to be spayed and neutered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| My personal cats do live inside, but I recognize that some people do let their cats out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7056)|
| 1:57:43| So veterinarians, some people say that veterinarians don't support TNR, and I'm here to tell you that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7063)|
| 1:57:49| There's definitely controversy within the profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| but the American Association of Feline Practitioners has endorsed TNR, as has the public health folks that Janet referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7072)|
| 1:58:01| There's many veterinarians who volunteer for a program called Feral Fixins at UT that happens four times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7081)|
| 1:58:07| and similar programs in other communities draw as many as 100 to 150 volunteers from the community to provide sterilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7087)|
| 1:58:17| We all want to see fewer cats, and TNR is the best way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| So please help us by moving forward and helping us become more progressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| We've definitely cut the intake of cats in half in the last 10 years, and so this is the next logical step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7108)|
| 1:58:35| This is the thing we need to do to get more to the bottom of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| We focus in certain areas where there's more cats to have a better effect, and as Janet mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| we've been trapping and removing and euthanizing cats from our community for decades, literally decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7126)|
| 1:58:52| The fact that they are still there, to me, is proof that it does not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| So let's TNR and help solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7136)|
| 1:59:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| We've got three commissioners that I've noticed that might have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7143)|
| 1:59:07| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| Does rabies vaccination require a yearly booster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| Rabies vaccination is supposed to be readministered after the first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| and then you can use a three-year product so it conveys a three-year timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| Will we be able to track these cats and know which ones we have given rabies vaccination to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| And will we be able to track these cats coming in and test them before we vaccinate them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7175)|
| 1:59:47| Will they be tested before they're vaccinated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| Well, you don't really test them for rabies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| I mean, you have to kind of go into the brain for that, and it's kind of lethal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| But as was mentioned, the last known case of cat rabies in Knox County was 1969,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7196)|
| 2:00:05| and there have been cases in other counties in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| but it's really a very low incidence in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| So as far as that's concerned, any cats that are tipped, that come back tipped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| it basically means a notch taken off the tip of their ear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| will receive a rabies vaccine regardless of when they were last with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| The program at Young-Williams will involve microchipping of the cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| so that we can adequately track which cat where and what date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| but many people who provide this type of or who do this type of program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| will keep records with pictures and databases so that they know what cats are vaccinated when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| And I guess the cats will be given a physical to make sure they're physically healthy enough to go back into the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| Yes. I mean, sometimes there's cats that I have had brought to me for surgery as a feral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7250)|
| 2:00:57| that I've just determined this cat is not in good physical shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| and it would be inhumane to send this cat back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| So in those situations, you know, those would be euthanized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| What other type testing is done to make sure a cat is healthy before it's sent back out into the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| Pretty much just a physical exam that's done while they're being prepped for surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7273)|
| 2:01:19| If they are showing signs of disease, they might be tested for something like leukemia or FIV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7279)|
| 2:01:24| but there's studies that show that those diseases are at no higher incidence in feral cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| than they are in owned, homed populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| So it's really not an increased risk for cats that come from a feral background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| You may have answered this question already, Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| So the cats would not be automatically tested for feline leukemia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| Dr. Julie Levy released a study in 2003 demonstrating tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7309)|
| 2:01:56| or showing test results from over 6,000 cats in Raleigh, North Carolina, over a several-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7316)|
| 2:02:03| and the percentage of cats testing positive was actually slightly lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| than other studies had demonstrated for owned cats in other situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| So there's no higher risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| You want me to be next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| Okay. Go ahead, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| Actually, I thought I saw Commissioner Jay's light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| Two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Does Knox County support Young-Williams Animal Shelter financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| and what is our role with animal control in general as it relates to your program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| or general animal control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| I think it's under the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| So we are a 501c3, but we do have a defined services agreement with both the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7368)|
| 2:02:56| and the county that all animals picked up by animal control are brought to our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7376)|
| 2:03:02| So that contract and that dollar amount is effectively allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7382)|
| 2:03:10| for the mandatory holding period when these animals come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| for basically food, shelter, and care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| And one other quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| If this program is approved and adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| what time frame and number of months or years would you expect to see if this is effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7406)|
| 2:03:32| I mean, is this a we'll look at it every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| or is this a hey, it's going to really take three to five years to sort of see if the program works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7416)|
| 2:03:41| or is this something you expect in a shorter time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| So I can tell you that there's already city council did pass it in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| It became effective for city animal control on February 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| and it has already made a tremendous impact for our shelter and for the cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7432)|
| 2:04:00| We returned 64 cats in the month of February back to the community through TNVR programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7440)|
| 2:04:08| And so to that point, you know, we are not housing these cats where they are susceptible to disease and stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7448)|
| 2:04:17| And, again, we're able to get them back to the community where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| So if they are indoor-outdoor cats, if they're being cared for by multiple caretakers, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7461)|
| 2:04:27| they have that greater chance of finding their way back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| Is the ultimate statistic how many you are having to euthanize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| Is that a benchmark number that if you're euthanizing less and returning more, that shows the program is reducing the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7474)|
| 2:04:42| That's certainly one benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| One of the other benchmarks that ideally you want to reduce your cat population by roughly 75 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| That's certainly a goal over roughly a three-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| But I think we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| Many programs have shown to do it much more immediate than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7503)|
| 2:05:04| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| Mr. Testerman, I wanted to thank you for, in your packet, using examples of communities located within about a three-hour drive of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7506)|
| 2:05:16| I thought that was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| And then the other two examples, you know, are basically the eastern United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| Because sometimes we get documentation where this works well in Spokane or, you know, Los Angeles, and that makes no relevance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7522)|
| 2:05:33| But picking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| You did a great job on this, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| We spent a lot of time consulting with many of those communities and shelter directors as they launched the program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7537)|
| 2:05:45| And like I said, we are the largest community in Tennessee that hasn't enacted this practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7545)|
| 2:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| And I might add, Ms. Testerman, you know, I hold the Institute of Agriculture at the University of Tennessee in very high regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| And knowing that UTIA is involved, either through the vet school or with the Thicks and Ferrells, I know that there is a program over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7559)|
| 2:06:07| And, you know, seeing UTIA involved in a program related to this is all the endorsement that I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7567)|
| 2:06:13| So thank you so much for bringing this forward to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| Commissioner Schoonmaker, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Yeah, just one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| Myers Morton is in the audience, and he's been here the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| And he's actually the one that did all the legal work behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| And so I just wanted to acknowledge him and thank him for his efforts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| Thank you, Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| My fellow commissioners, this motion is probably for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| It's a ordinance, so it does need to be formally read, or it counts only next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| So, and Madam Clerk, who was the one that made the first and the second on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| It was Anders and Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| It was Anders and Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| So the Chair will entertain an all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7613)|
| 2:06:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7619)|
| 2:07:00| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7620)|
| 2:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7621)|
| 2:07:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| For the record, Commissioner Gill passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| So the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| This will move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| Well, my fellow commissioners, what I might do, I'd like to propose we have several items on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| and on tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7634)|

| 2:09:21| Item 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7761)|
| 2:09:22| It's a report from Engineering and Public Works on any issues or damages found during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| flood repair and cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7770)|
| 2:09:38| Hello, fellas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7779)|
| 2:09:40| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| I've got an inquisition here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| Like in most districts, we have a lot of damage going along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| I'll give you a few examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7791)|
| 2:09:54| Like on Griffin Road, we had a drainage where they drained into a sinkhole type situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7794)|
| 2:10:00| and it got stopped up for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| I guess somebody was putting trash down in there and took care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| Then on Pettigo Road, we have some sinkholes there that was developed around the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7806)|
| 2:10:13| there of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| Then we had, let's see, I think we had, this being a 100-year flood, now going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7816)|
| 2:10:27| what have we learned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| Is there or will there be any plans made to take care of or help mitigate some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| problems that we saw in this flood that we had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| Then we had things like slopes on Bishop Ridge, the Bishop Ridge condo project, where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7837)|
| 2:10:43| developer made a hill, and it has all slid off because of the weight of the water on that slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7843)|
| 2:10:50| that they had made when they were developing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| Then can there be some problems there that we can address when we do designs of subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7853)|
| 2:11:04| that take care of some of the slope problems and the drainage issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| Then we had the other one on Pettigo Road where a subdivision was made afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7868)|
| 2:11:16| and they made a driveway that blocked a natural drain area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7876)|
| 2:11:22| and that where the road was built up was like at 10, I think 74, 75, something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7882)|
| 2:11:29| But the subdivision, which was about 200 or 300 yards back up the hill, was at 1071.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7889)|
| 2:11:35| So when the water filled up and that driveway didn't let it go down through the natural drain area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| it was like three or four feet of water in the basements of that subdivision up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| And how do we get around those problems where that person was let build that driveway up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7905)|
| 2:11:51| to go across those drainage areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| And those were just some of the issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| I just want to know what you thought about some of those issues that we've had out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| And I know other districts have had issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| I'm just bringing up some of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| Be glad to, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7925)|
| 2:12:06| Yeah, that Griffin Road sinkhole, that location there, those homes, I think that was we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7926)|
| 2:12:15| They were platted in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7935)|
| 2:12:18| It kind of goes to what Commissioner Anders was saying previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| Our standards are a lot more stringent now than they used to be in regard to development around sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7941)|
| 2:12:28| This past February storm would not be constructed today because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| And we are looking at trying to find some relief for those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| There's a conveyance across Griffin Road that ultimately ends up under Andersonville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7957)|
| 2:12:43| So we're trying to secure some drainage easements downstream to actually provide an overflow for water to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7963)|
| 2:12:50| prior to, you know, getting into those homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| The same thing with Pettigo Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| We're also looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| There was what appears to be maybe some field that was placed that partially blocked the natural conveyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7978)|
| 2:13:04| The problem with that is the downstream conveyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| The next downstream neighbor also got flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| So we don't want to move that problem down to him as well because he's already received a flooding situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7990)|
| 2:13:18| To answer your question, we are looking at each one of those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| Hopefully within the next 60 days this body may see an actual flood study in looking at some of these more problematic areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8001)|
| 2:13:30| to where we can be proactive to hopefully prevent these from occurring again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8010)|
| 2:13:35| So you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| We are looking at these instances and trying to find ways to prevent them in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8016)|
| 2:13:42| And let's see, there was one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| Oh, the slope on Bishop's Ridge, you know, that is a two-to-one slope on the backside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8025)|
| 2:13:53| We just need to be very conscious of making sure the drainage that runs down those slopes is adequately controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8033)|
| 2:14:00| because that's typically where you get your slope failures when water does get on that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| So there are things we can do to minimize those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8044)|
| 2:14:09| But I appreciate you bringing those issues up because there are always things that we can learn from these types of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8049)|
| 2:14:15| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| Jim, first off, I just wanted to thank you for what you and your team did in those conditions of trying to get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8061)|
| 2:14:29| get the signage up to close those roads, and then to keep us continually where you sent us the e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| with the updated of where the status of each road that was closed in each of the commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| I really appreciate your team doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| The other thing is with the Everett Road kind of cave in there, what do you think the actual cost to repair that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8083)|
| 2:14:51| And a lot of that water did come from 4075 Interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| Is that something that we could recoup something from TDOT to help to offset some of the costs of repairing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8096)|
| 2:15:04| We haven't looked at that specific issue yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| I think it would be somewhat hard to do, Commissioner, because once we started excavating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8108)|
| 2:15:14| it almost appeared that there was a wet weather spring that was under the roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| so it may have been more contributed to that than maybe the drainage off the state's highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8118)|
| 2:15:24| But that particular, I don't have it broke down specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| but we probably spent probably around $60,000 in what we call graded solid rock to build the road back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8128)|
| 2:15:36| That's essentially what we did in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8136)|
| 2:15:38| We removed all the soft material and essentially just built a buttress or kind of somewhat of like a retaining wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8138)|
| 2:15:46| you could say, with graded solid rock, which is rock that ranges from size from six inches to two feet in diameter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8146)|
| 2:15:53| to support the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| So ballpark around $60,000 to repair that Everett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| Okay, that's very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| And then so far, are you very impressed with your safety improvement project going on in North Shore Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8161)|
| 2:16:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| I think we've got a little over half of it done, and we've only been down there for approximately three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| Obviously, we're conscious of traffic, so we're trying to do it as fast as we can to avoid minimizing inconvenience to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8176)|
| 2:16:23| because it is a busily traveled road, so to ask for people's patience as they go through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8183)|
| 2:16:28| because shutting the laying down of North Shore is never a fun thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| and that's why we're working as hard as we can to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| So weather permitting, and if we don't hit any rock, because we did have to rent a hammer last week to bust out a section of rock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8194)|
| 2:16:42| we should be done this week with that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8202)|
| 2:16:45| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8207)|
| 2:16:48| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| Jim, I've got to start with a couple of very general things and then get to a couple of very specific things, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8218)|
| 2:17:00| In the 3rd District, there was a lot of flooding of homes that were nowhere near the 100-year FEMA flood map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8220)|
| 2:17:08| What is the chances we can get FEMA to update their maps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| Because the worst thing possible is to have your house flooded when you were denied the opportunity to buy flood insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8231)|
| 2:17:19| We actually are going to meet with FEMA, with our flood manager, and we'll have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8239)|
| 2:17:25| I know those folks in Dutchtown Harbor flooded, and that particular flood wall there was set one foot above the 100-year storm event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8245)|
| 2:17:36| Crestwood Hills had some homes flooded, too, that were nowhere near the FEMA flood map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8256)|
| 2:17:40| Yes, so we're not really sure exactly what occurred because when we constructed that flood wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| we never envisioned what we saw because that flood wall was 13 foot high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8265)|
| 2:17:51| But we will speak with FEMA and determine what options we have in regard to assistance with those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8271)|
| 2:17:59| Have we monitored the amount of infill that's been laid along Dutchtown Road for ball fields or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| to make sure they were all set to allow for holding water that was displayed somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| Correct, we have, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| Is there any development that's occurred since the flood wall was constructed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| Second thing, a lot of areas, the way our topography is around here, there are sinkholes that work as natural basins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8299)|
| 2:18:29| draining basins for water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| And I understand this was a very unusual event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| We had water get into people's houses in multiple ways, just through pure saturation and improper swells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| and then water bit back up from our storm system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8319)|
| 2:18:48| Is there any way we can enforce our dirty lots better on these properties that have these sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| to make sure they stay as clean as possible in order for water that naturally goes that way to drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| and not be impeded or pick up trash along the way and clog them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| The dirty lot ordinance gives us a lot of flexibility in regard to what is considered trash or debris on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8342)|
| 2:19:12| So we can work with our codes folks and all those sinkholes out there in the Gulf Park community especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8352)|
| 2:19:21| The one where it really all drains to is the one there between Fox Lonas and Dutchtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| We can certainly check that and make sure that those are clear and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| And if need be, issue a violation to the landowner to make those repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| Has there ever been any – I know there was a study in 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| I've seen the dye test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| I'm still waiting for the rest of that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| But has there been any consideration given to the property that is to the south side of Dutchtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| between Gulf Park and Dutchtown Road that is about, I guess, eight, six acres back there that's virtually land logged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8386)|
| 2:19:54| And also that land that is on – that you spoke of, you mentioned on Fox Lonas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8394)|
| 2:19:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8399)|
| 2:20:00| Has there ever been any kind of joint effort between the city and the county to acquire those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8400)|
| 2:20:05| since those do seem to be the main way for water to get out of the Cedar Bluff area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8405)|
| 2:20:12| That actually – that 98 study predates me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| I came to the county in 99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| I am in the process of reviewing that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| To my knowledge, no conversations ever existed with partnerships of the acquisition of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8420)|
| 2:20:25| But we are going to get another consultant to kind of update that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8425)|
| 2:20:30| And it's a good possibility that maybe the acquisition of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| or maybe the expansion of the existing detention facilities in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| could be an option moving forward as part of a further capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| And the last question is potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| I know the state has a real issue with potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| I know the city is dealing with an issue of potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| How are the potholes on the county roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8450)|
| 2:20:55| You know, we haven't seen as many as what –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| obviously the state has a – you know, trying to maintain I-40s is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| I mean, you've got 70,000 to 80,000 cars a day, and a good percentage of those are trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| which are a lot harder on the asphalt surface than we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| So, you know, I do feel for them because it's harder to patch a pothole on the interstate too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8470)|
| 2:21:15| because, you know, it's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| But we haven't had – we probably get on average of maybe one pothole request per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8477)|
| 2:21:26| So I think this body given us, you know, several million dollars for the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8486)|
| 2:21:33| We've received a little uptick of paving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| I think we've been able to reuse that in a very effective way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| and have been able to pave all the roads that were prone to potholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| that had a lot of cracking and other deficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| So we're seeing them, but not with the frequency that TDOT has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| Okay. Well, I would hope we weren't having the frequency they're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8513)|
| 2:21:57| But what I was getting at is Commissioner Jay is going to have a discussion later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| about the function of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| And I have spoken with you about a contract that you may be bringing towards us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8523)|
| 2:22:08| with an infrared pothole repair situation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| that is probably a much better way to fix potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| I was wondering if this body should maybe consider using some rainy day funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8536)|
| 2:22:21| to try and give the engineering public work some extra money to fix potholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8541)|
| 2:22:26| because I don't really like the idea of taking paving money to pave roads to fix potholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8546)|
| 2:22:33| I think if you address potholes early and properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8553)|
| 2:22:37| you can save yourself a lot of paving down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| Is there any way you can look at what kind of number that would need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| for us to get a good grasp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| Because the last few years have been very bad on our road systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| They have, and I can get you a rough number on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8568)|
| 2:22:52| You're exactly right. We did discuss that infrared repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| That's a much more effective and long-term way to patch a pothole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8575)|
| 2:22:59| If you would, explain how the bonding is so much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8579)|
| 2:23:03| Yeah, and I can send Drusilla a YouTube video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8583)|
| 2:23:07| because it's probably the best way to get a feel for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| But it's essentially a propane heater that comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| and actually heats up the asphalt surrounding the pothole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| and you mix in fresh asphalt with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| And then once it's heated up and pliable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| you break it in and then actually have a roller and compact it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| So it essentially prevents the cracks and the seams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| because what's causing that pothole is water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| So by heating it up and sealing those joints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8614)|
| 2:23:37| you don't have the potential for water getting back into the asphalt pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| But I'll send a YouTube link to Drusilla so she can forward it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| It's a relatively new technique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| and it's a much more effective way of repairing a pothole long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| Yeah, I think you said earlier that a lot of times an initial pothole will form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| and that will cause deterioration along the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| that will eventually lead to having to repave the whole road or a large section of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| So I would like for us to get ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| But along with Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'd like to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| I know you guys had your hands full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| That was a very tragic event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8650)|
| 2:24:13| And the man hours you guys put in and getting out and putting the barriers up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8653)|
| 2:24:18| you all did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| The guys did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| They're always there when we need them, so I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| And one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| What's sinkhole cost at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| Greenwell sinkhole, got that right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| We've still got a few outstanding numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| but it's going to be approximately around $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| to completely repair the sinkhole on Greenwell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8676)|
| 2:24:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| And Commissioner Smith, thank you for bringing that up about the pothole repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| That's pretty darn fascinating, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8686)|
| 2:24:51| Next, I've got Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Director Snowden, you talked about maybe a flood study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| I'm a firm believer we only are as good as what we learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8699)|
| 2:25:02| from the last time we went through it instead of ignoring it and doing it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| Is there any kind of comprehensive meeting between you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| and emergency management and floods and code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| I mean, just a comprehensive understanding of what we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8713)|
| 2:25:18| Is that what you're talking about, the report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| Is that a meeting coming up, or is there something fueling that, or is it simply internal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8720)|
| 2:25:26| Well, it's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| We want to meet with Colin, with the EMA folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| because we want to accurately locate all the locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8733)|
| 2:25:37| I mean, obviously there was a lot reported to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| but there may be ones that he got reported that we didn't receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| So we want to meet with him and kind of clarify the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8742)|
| 2:25:46| and then we'll meet with a consultant, a hydraulic expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| and actually get a scope together for the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8751)|
| 2:25:54| And then once we get that scope lined out, actually bring that contract to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| because most likely it would be in excess of $100,000 to do something of that magnitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8758)|
| 2:26:02| So this body would need to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| Do you have any idea what the timeline, if that all proceeded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| I mean, would it take a matter of months or a lot longer to sort of get a comprehensive study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| And I ask because we've got legislators that maybe we want to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8774)|
| 2:26:19| We've got TPO meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| We've got internal Knox County meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| I mean, I think it's data that everybody can use, both on a local and a state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| I mean, I would think we could probably have something to this body for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| maybe not in April, but certainly by May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| And, you know, one of the things that my guys did through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8795)|
| 2:26:40| is we tried to mark on the pavement or in some form or fashion the high water mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8800)|
| 2:26:46| because we wanted to capture how high the water got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| to where we can hopefully design and prevent, you know, that from occurring in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| kind of set that bar, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8813)|
| 2:26:56| I would think certainly by the end of the calendar year at the latest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| we would have something that would be presentable to the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8819)|
| 2:27:04| And we would involve the community through that process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| But for a final document, I would think something by the end of the calendar year would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8827)|
| 2:27:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8833)|
| 2:27:14| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8834)|
| 2:27:15| I may have a couple of questions, too, after Commissioner Biggs has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| Actually, I was going to ask Commissioner Smith a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| Dutchtown Harbor, is that the piece of property you're talking about in front of CAK right there where people were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8843)|
| 2:27:28| So I got some phone calls on that property, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| They were saying that CAK was pumping the water into that subdivision from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8851)|
| 2:27:37| The wall you're talking about, it leads up and underneath the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8857)|
| 2:27:42| and that's going into a sinkhole off Foxsona?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| I was trying to wrap my mind around everything you were saying, but is that what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8864)|
| 2:27:51| If I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8871)|
| 2:27:52| Yeah, go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| The west side of Cedar Bluff on all maps indicates that it drains into the Turkey Creek watershed, the majority of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8875)|
| 2:28:04| But in reality, it really flows back to 10-mile through a network of sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8884)|
| 2:28:11| I got calls, too, about CAK pumping water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| I called Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8894)|
| 2:28:15| I think they went out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| I'm not sure where they pumped it to because at that point out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| any time you pumped the water, unless you were getting it miles away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| it was just going back into the sinkhole and coming straight back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8904)|
| 2:28:28| And we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8908)|
| 2:28:29| When we got reports of pumping, we would go out, and we've actually talked to people and told them to stop that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8909)|
| 2:28:34| because it could cause harm to maybe an adjacent neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| So we did have a couple instances where we did actually go out and tell somebody that they needed to stop that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8918)|
| 2:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8928)|
| 2:28:49| Commissioner Biggs, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8929)|
| 2:28:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8931)|
| 2:28:52| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8932)|
| 2:28:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8933)|
| 2:28:54| Jim, I just want to echo what Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| I think you and your department do a phenomenal job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| and I appreciate how responsive you are to all the concerns that I've sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8939)|
| 2:29:04| Just in the 8th District, I know there were a couple of roads that were kind of among the last really to stay closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8944)|
| 2:29:11| One was Coryton Road, which I know the spot on Coryton Road that floods, and it actually floods quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8951)|
| 2:29:20| Probably of greater concern, though, is Luttrell Road at Jim Luttrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| Correct me if I'm wrong, that's not in a FEMA flood zone either, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8964)|
| 2:29:29| It's not, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8969)|
| 2:29:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8970)|
| 2:29:31| Have you looked at or will you be looking at what possible impact the final development in Shannon Valley Farms may have had on that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8971)|
| 2:29:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| That was one of the ones that we're definitely going to get that consultant to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| We looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8985)|
| 2:29:46| There's over 1,000 acres that drains to that point, so there's a significant upstream watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8986)|
| 2:29:54| The developer, Smithfield, was required to remove about 18,000 cubic yards of material in the pond during development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=8994)|
| 2:30:02| to compensate for his additional impervious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| We're still trying to figure out if he did that, but even if he hadn't, that's a teaspoon in an ocean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9006)|
| 2:30:13| so that is something that we're going to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| There was a couple of homes in Shannon Valley Farms that got flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| I think one on Jim Luttrell, maybe, that got flooded, so certainly that's on our list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190318?start=9018)|
