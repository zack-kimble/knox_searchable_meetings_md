| 0:07:28| Councilman Grieve, did you have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| We're going to turn this meeting now over to Mr. Swanson, who will give us the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| that we will use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| I think council has agreed upon a process to utilize in this process, but let me go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| over that process and make sure that it meets with your all's approval, and if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| the case, then I'm sure the chair will entertain a motion to adopt that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| First of all, the first thing that will happen is council will be provided an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| for discussion about the qualification sought for the successful applicant for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| The applicants already have drawn numbers to determine the order in which they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Each applicant will be given up to five minutes to speak to council to state that applicant's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| case for being appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Now, each of the applicants also may have, each may have two speakers, one of whom must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| be a resident of the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| The two speakers speaking on behalf of the applicant will have up to two minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=506)|
| 0:08:33| so those will be short rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| The speakers for each applicant will follow immediately the applicant for whom they speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| After all applicants and speakers have completed their presentations, the voting process will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| Voting will be done in rounds with the recorder calling the name of each council member who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| shall respond with the name of the applicant for whom that member wishes to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| There's going to be no discussion among council while the vote is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| If no applicant receives six or more votes, the voting will proceed to the next round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| with all applicants remaining eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| After ten rounds of voting, if no applicant has been selected, council will then discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| whether or not they wish to adopt a process where the person or persons receiving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| lowest number of votes would be eliminated from further consideration in the next round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| The voting will be concluded when an applicant has six or more votes at the conclusion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| any round of voting after which the successful applicant is to be sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| Any questions about that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Let me recognize Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| And I think the chair will probably entertain a motion now to adopt this process to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=588)|
| 0:09:57| the selection of the fifth district council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Chair, we'll entertain that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Any opposers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| We are now at the point of a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| If council needs to discuss the qualifications, salt for any applicant, is there any discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| I couldn't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| I'm sorry, Mr. Delagolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I just turned it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| I don't know that there's anything profound in my statement, but obviously we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| for a person who's got some basic skills, some life experience, some community involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=641)|
| 0:10:51| and an ability to present themselves and represent their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| And, of course, that varies all over the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| I think we're blessed with some very good applicants, but we'll be judging from their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| statements and their conduct and the papers they've submitted whether they look like they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| have the ability to represent both the people from their district and the city at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=668)|
| 0:11:19| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Would you give us the order in which they're going to be presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| We're going to have Bill Rowland, R. Hoyas, Renee Hoyas, Birchfield, Ms. Eason, Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=684)|
| 0:11:41| and Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| Seeing no lights, I guess we're ready to begin with the first person, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| be Bill Rowland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| Mr. Rowland, if you would come down and give your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=721)|
| 0:12:11| My name is Bill Rowland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=731)|
| 0:12:20| I reside at 106 Charlene Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| Honorable Mayor and honorable council people, I stand before you tonight in judgment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=746)|
| 0:12:36| your position in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| I'm not going to talk a lot about what I've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| I'm going to talk about what I see the future to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| And that future for this city, what a great city we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| What a great place it is to bring people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| So by being a cheerleader for this city, I hope to bring that enthusiasm to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| You know, when we all started in community work, we got into the grasshopper leagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| and the scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| We all started it in Skip Norwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| We had a field that was so bad, crawdads would come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| So as a community rec commission, we voted and got $52,000 to build that field again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| One of the greatest days of my life was when Ernie Sharp called me, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| We're going to turn the lights on on this field tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| So I went down, and soon that whole valley was illuminated from in Skip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=818)|
| 0:13:49| And as community members who worked on that commission, we all stood and cheered and laughed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| and cried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| And, ladies and gentlemen, tonight, that's what I call community pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| That community pride foresold everybody in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| It's something we had to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| I look at the council people here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| I see that community pride in your faces and in your eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| So that's the reason I want to become a cheerleader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| I've been successful in two businesses, sold them, worked for a major company, was part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| of the 82 Fair, had a partner in Bo Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| We moved on around the world doing a lot of instrumental things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| Worked hard to save the U.S. Pavilion, but we had tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| We just couldn't raise the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| The one good thing about it was we identified Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| There's people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| One of the things I'd like to see challenged this group with tonight, let's set something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| out in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| And as a council member, I want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| I want this city to look about becoming a city of fountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| Let's go out and like a Gideon Summit and let's build a 30-foot water fountain with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=912)|
| 0:15:20| public and private funds, not from the city council funds, but let's make the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| get involved again so we have what we call community pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| That's something I will stress while on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| I will only serve for the remainder of the term of Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| I do not want to become a career politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| I have been there and done that, as a lot of you all say, but I want to be part of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| I want to give back to this city something that they have been so, so good to me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=957)|
| 0:16:05| let me establish and be successful in two businesses and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| When we bought the Thrifty franchise, it had 75 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| We built it to a fleet of 352 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| And we did it with community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| We give a car each year to the University of Tennessee Athletic Fund, Scholarship Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| We've done it for the last, since 93, and my wife and I continue to do that today because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| we want to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| We give money to local charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| We've donated cars to PTA for auctions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| So that's what you give back to your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| You give something for what you have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| So my statute tonight is thanks for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| What a great city we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| It's going to be so much fun to become a cheerleader again, to go out, find these people who want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| We have two-thirds of the people in the United States that live east of the Mississippi River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| We are within an eight-hour drive of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| Twelve million people go by our city each year going to the Great Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| I want to see if we can stop some of those people and bring them into our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| And how can we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| We've got to have something that shows we're proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| Fountains are a great draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Look at Rome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| Look at all the great cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| They have fountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| I'd like to see that program initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| About the budget, we've got that to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| We've got the 10-year plan to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Mr. Rowland, I hate to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| You have about 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| I'll conclude by saying thank all of you for the opportunity, and God bless America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| You have a person who has signed up to speak on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| Mr. Rowland Blaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| You have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| Ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| If you would give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| My name is Rowland Blaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| My address is 108 Charlene Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| Ladies and gentlemen, once again, my name is Rowland Blaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| The candidate I'm speaking for, obviously, is Mr. Rowland, who is also my grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| As I would like to begin this speech, this day is also very important in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| It is the 50-year anniversary of the ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1133)|
| 0:19:05| I think this speech really personifies what my grandfather is trying to do here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| He's done everything he needs to do in a business setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| He's also the person that taught me how to be a man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| My grandfather is very influential on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| He even helped me choose the course I'm going to go in college, which is a communications and journalism studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1162)|
| 0:19:31| Since the time that I was a child, whether it was us working out in the yard, to him taking me to places of this caliber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1171)|
| 0:19:40| to be around people of this caliber, he taught me to have a strong work ethic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| and to treat every single person I come across, whether they come from under a bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| or if they came from Pennsylvania Avenue, that you treat them with the most utmost respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| And I'm not going to stay up here and ramble on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| but I just want to let everybody know that this man is perfectly qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| Nobody will have more compassion for this seat while he's sitting in on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| and nobody will serve it with more integrity than my grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| And I appreciate you guys' time and have a wonderful evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| The next candidate is Renee Hoyas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| If you'd come down and give your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| My name is Renee Hoyas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| I live at 327 East Quincy Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| Esteemed council members, esteemed mayor, thank you for the opportunity to tell you who I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| and why I'd like to be the fifth district appointee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| For those of you who don't know me, I'd like to give you a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| I'm not from here, as I'm sure you can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| I was born and raised in the Napa Valley long before it was discovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| When the primary crop there was prunes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| I attended Napa Valley schools and then attended community college in the Bay Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| I transferred to San Francisco State where I studied acting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| That was my first career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| After a few years doing that, I transferred to the University of California at Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| and I have two master's degrees, one in avian sciences and one in management and agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| It's kind of like an MBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| But to go when I was in graduate school, I worked my way as a river guide through college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| and I guided on rivers, and that's where I discovered my love of rivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and discovered the river protection movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| At that point, I got a job creating web-based tools for resource managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| so that they could better manage water quality in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| And then I was tapped to work in the Davis administration, Governor Gray Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| I worked for an appointee of his, Mary Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| And my job was to create a watershed plan for the entire state of California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| But before I could do that, Arnold Schwarzenegger started running a recall campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| and so that dream was never realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| Gray Davis lost the recall, and I started looking for a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| And so I put out my resume, and I came to Tennessee for an interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| and I remember I was here for a week, and I said to myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| if I don't get the job, I'm going to move here because this place is beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| And that was in 2003, and I moved here then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| I've lived here at Quincy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| I bought a little house in the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood, and I love it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| I like the people I live with and the sense of community that we have in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| And I love what I do at the network, working statewide to protect water quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| and help people protect the rivers they live with and love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| Since I've been here, I've been very fortunate to participate in many community activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| I'm a member of the best class ever of Leadership Knoxville, Class of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| There are some members here from that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| I'm now on the Curriculum Planning Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| so I'll be doing a lot of planning for the future class leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| I participated in the Read With Me program at Christian Berry Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| I'm on KUB's PACE 10 Public Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| I also hold a national chair with the National Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| It oversees 1,200 organizations similar to the Tennessee Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| I'm a graduate of the three-year fellowship of the National Environmental Leadership Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| and I'm also a member of the National Ski Patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| So if we have to ski to city council meeting and you get hurt, I can help you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| I was asked by members of the community both within and without the district to seek this appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| and when I got to thinking about the work of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| I realized that it could allow me to dig deeper into the communities that make up the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| I became very curious and eager to find out what's going on in these other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| in Fountain City and Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| You know, what do people in Powell care about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| What do they think about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| And, of course, my decision affects all of Knoxville, not just my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| But I look at this as an opportunity and a means to learn more about the people who live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| and the processes that can make their lives either really, really good or really, really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| So am I an activist? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| I'm an activist for my job, and that is my worldview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| But I think clean water is important for our future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| and that expertise will be made available to council should those issues come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| Many issues come up before council that are unrelated to water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| and I think I have the reasoning skills to make good decisions for the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| and ultimately for the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| As many people like to tell me when they call asking our organization for help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| we're all hitched together in this great universe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| I'm grateful that you've given us the opportunity to introduce ourselves, all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| There's wonderful candidates tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| I'm really honored to be among them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| In a normal process, the community decides who they want, and they cast a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| and then they let the chips fall where they may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| I think this decision is being made, in this case, for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| and so the appointee here has a great responsibility to get the trust of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| because we are unknown to many people at this point, and I want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| I want to serve my community, and I want to serve the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Thank you, Ms. Hoyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| You have two people signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| The next person to speak for you is Max Reddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| If you would come down and give your name and address, and you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| Max Reddick, I speak outside the District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| My address is 2928 Renwick Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| I am a pastor, so this may be the first two-minute sermon I've ever given, but bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| Renee and I served together in North Knoxville Rotary Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| and so I have known Renee as a person of service and of leadership through that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| I see her first and foremost as someone with strength, strength of character and strength of passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| She is, by far, a person who, through her work with Clean Water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| through her work in the community, is passionate about helping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| passionate about championing values and standing beside others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| And if you need someone on your side, I would want Renee to go into the room for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| because of her strength and her passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| She's also an intelligent woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| I mean, she is a smart cookie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| I was exhausted almost listening to all her accolades that she read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| because she's been involved and educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| She's also smart enough to know when she doesn't know, and I've asked her questions before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| and I don't know, I'll get back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Come back and get a ream of paper with facts and figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| She does her homework, looks under the rocks, knows what she's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| She is also a professional person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| She is mature, polished, self-composed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| She is a person, I think, to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Reverend, I hate to interrupt you, but you've reached your two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| All right, you have another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| John Lane, if you would come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| My name is John Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| I reside at 3209 Orlando Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| I'm a commercial artist, which is a quiet life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| I'm not used to public speaking, so I'll try not to make this too agonizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| But I've known Ms. Hoyos for about five or six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| and I've been impressed by the way that she is able to function on an executive level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| without what we normally can think of as executive resources, you know, as far as funding and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| As an environmental advocate, she does nothing but not swim upstream, pun intended a lot of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1675)|
| 0:28:04| And I think that she does that with a lot of logic and a lot of patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| And I've also been impressed with the amount of sympathy she has for people that are not necessarily in her camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1691)|
| 0:28:19| And I think that is a very good quality for leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| And it's also for just working through tough issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| So I think she would make an excellent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Thank you, Mr. Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| The next candidate is Mr. Joe Birchfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| If you would come down and give your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| You'll have to excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| I'm getting over knee surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| My name is Joe Birchfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| I reside at 2511 Sander Avenue Northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| That is in the Arlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| It's one block off of Fairmont and one block off of Whittlespring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen of council, applicants, and audience, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| A lot of people don't come to government functions, but it's good to see a turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| I've lived in the 5th District for 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| In that district I've been a scoutmaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| I've been a football coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| I've done everything that you can possibly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| And if you read my resume, it would be longer than the lady that just left here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| I've seen a lot of things happen in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| I've seen the growth in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| I've seen public parks, walking trails, bike trails, new sidewalks, schools being revamped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1776)|
| 0:29:49| And then I've also seen schools close in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| I've seen crime up in the area, automobiles being broken in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| There are several burnt houses or dilapidated houses in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| But, you know, all those things can be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| And how can it be fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| There is no I in any office of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| It takes a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| I'm probably the only one here that ever held state office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| I was a state representative of the 13th District, which the 5th District was in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| I'm a worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| I believe in getting the job done and hanging in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| If you don't want the job, then don't apply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| If you read my resume, I was a commercial banker for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| I did budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| I've owned two companies in the 5th District and employed employees in the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| even some high school students from Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| The 5th District is my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| I was in the military service in the Air Force for 11 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| but I was able to come back within five blocks of where I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| I love this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| I want to see the sign again that says All-American City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| And who can make that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| The council can make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| We can go out of here with the right mind, knowing that there is a future for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| All the bad things we can take care of if we put our shoulders to the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| I thank you for the opportunity to come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| This is a very handsome and beautiful group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| I hope that the decision is made tonight for the person that has the most experience in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1885)|
| 0:31:33| in city business, in community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| And I thank you for the opportunity to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Thank you, Mr. Birchfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Thank you for the compliments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| The next person is Ms. Beth Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| If you would come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| My name is Beth Eason, 1606 Fairmont Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| I'm a resident of Fairmont Emerland neighborhood where my husband and I have lived for 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| Thank you for the opportunity to tell you why I want to serve and why I'm qualified to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| First, I'm interested in serving on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| Knoxville is my hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| I grew up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| I graduated from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| After college, though, I did move away, and I lived in some really great cities and towns and visited many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| But soon after that, I decided that I did want to return back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| This is where I wanted to settle down and where I wanted to start my own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| Experiencing other great cities as a resident there was also very beneficial to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| because when I moved back to Knoxville, I started to see how the best attributes of some of those cities in which I had lived could really benefit our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1966)|
| 0:32:55| I'm thinking about quality of life issues, things that make day-to-day living in a community really special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1975)|
| 0:33:05| like parks and clean streams, bike lanes, and historic neighborhoods with vibrant little commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1985)|
| 0:33:15| Long before green was the trend, I was making sustainability a priority in my work and in my community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=1995)|
| 0:33:24| I served on Governor Bredesen's Energy Policy Task Force, and I also served on Mayor Haslam's Energy and Sustainability Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2004)|
| 0:33:32| The city staff is currently completing the summary of the work that has been done through that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2012)|
| 0:33:41| Our community could be a regional leader as a vibrant and sustainable city, attracting clean industry, green businesses, and new residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2021)|
| 0:33:50| And this is all possible for Knoxville, and we're already well on our way to making Knoxville a more vibrant and sustainable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2030)|
| 0:33:59| That's why I want to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| I want to help maintain the momentum that the Haslam administration has put into place for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2041)|
| 0:34:09| And I want to hand over to the new mayor and to the fifth district council member a city that has continued to thrive and improve during this year of great transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2049)|
| 0:34:22| I believe I'm qualified for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| First, I'm a good listener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| I'm an observer and a coalition builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| Through my community work, I've learned how to listen to many viewpoints and how to work with diverse groups to find common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| These are also skills that are necessary for me to be a successful architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| and they're also skills that transfer easily to the skills that are needed for a good city council person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| In architecture, my job is to listen, to observe, to research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| and then to compile that information from a team of people into a buildable, functional, and on-budget structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2094)|
| 0:35:04| It also is a set of skills that I'm continuing to improve upon, because every project is a unique challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| The goal is to find the common desires and priorities from a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| build coalitions around common ground, and then move forward together to achieve successful results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| Secondly, I'm a small business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| I understand the challenges of running a business in difficult economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| I also understand the impact that local government decisions can have on businesses and the quality of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2131)|
| 0:35:40| And third, I have experienced a community involvement in my professional work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| that allows me to be ready to start work without too much of a learning curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| I've had opportunity to work on policy issues and city regulations, such as neighborhood overlays, zoning, sector plans, and building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2149)|
| 0:35:59| I've also worked with many of the city departments, as well as Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Historic Zoning Commission, and the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| This has prepared me to begin work immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| And I think this is very important for a short-term appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Having said that, I know there will also be many issues that I will need to learn more about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| And I'll approach that with enthusiasm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| I'll reach out to staff and to the residents of my district to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| Serving on city council comes with great responsibility, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| So to sum up, I'm qualified to serve on city council because I bring these three qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| community leadership and professional skills, as a listener, observer, and coalition builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| I'm a small business owner, and I understand how various decisions may impact businesses in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| And third, I have experience participating on advisory boards, working with city departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| and understand the processes of BZA, MPC, and Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| So I'm ready to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| I've invested my time and effort in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| and I see this as an opportunity to further serve my community, the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| You have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| And I'm the right person to fill this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| You have two persons sign up to speak on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| Annette Anderson, if you would come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| You have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| I'm Annette Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| I live at 509 West Hills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| I've known Beth for over 20 years in several capacities and several different times of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| I first met, I was, for 22 years I was director of the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| I first met Beth when she came as a soon-to-be-graduated young professional from the School of Architecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| to volunteer her time to design a playground for the Helen Ross McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| a playground for abused children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| She stayed with the design center as a volunteer professional advisor for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| continues that involvement today, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| When I was working at the design center, as you might guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| I had the good fortune to get to work with many of Knoxville's leading architects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| including for many happy years, the time when Councilman Reeve was chairman of our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| And even in that select company, Beth was outstanding in her commitment to her community projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| and to her clients, to the energy and enthusiasm that she put into projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| and she was a pleasure to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| I retired in 1995, but again had the chance to work with Beth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| when she became active in the League of Women Voters about 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| That was when she was just starting her new, now very successful, private practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| But nevertheless, she had the time and energy to give the league leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| by leading the league's land use committee, by serving on its board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| subsequently becoming president of the league and serving on the state board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| If anything, her enthusiasm for her civic involvement had increased over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Ms. Anderson, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but your two minutes, you've gotten to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| He's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| The next person is Marcus Chatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| If you'd come down, give your name and address, and you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| Hello. Marcus Chatty, 1532 Emerland Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| I'm here to tell you why Beth is the person for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| I've lived in the 5th District since moving here from West Tennessee nine years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| and I moved into the Fairmont Emerland neighborhood, so we're neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| And in that capacity, I've seen Beth work with the Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| of which I'm a board member, in securing a neighborhood conservation overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| as well as dealing with many other issues that face our neighborhood, as do face many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| Beth is also a professional colleague, and in that capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| I've seen her leadership skills demonstrated with the U.S. Green Building Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| As she mentioned, she's also served at the state and local levels on energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| and sustainability task forces, both for Governor Bredesen and for our former mayor, Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| Through these experiences, I've come to know Beth as a great neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| and a very capable professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| As an emerging professional myself, currently seeking architectural licensure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| I've found Beth to be most helpful, always willing to answer my questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| willing to listen and provide very thoughtful insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| I personally have had the privilege over the last two years of serving on the Knox County Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| which has been my introduction to civic service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| I learned very quickly that there are two critical things that a civic servant must do and do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| One of them, each of you, I can see, are doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| That is being a very good listener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Beth is a very good listener.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| But above and beyond that, that listener must provide carefully thought-out responses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2481)|
| 0:41:30| that are not only insightful, but considerate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| Thirty seconds, Mr. Chatty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Beth possesses both of those qualities to the utmost degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| That is why you should vote for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| The next candidate is Mr. Charles Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| If you would come down and give your name, address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| My name is Charles Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| I live at 386 Hiawassee Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| And I really want to thank all of you for giving me the opportunity to come here and apply for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| It's a very important position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| I realize it's an interim position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| I realize if I'm selected, I won't be elected by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| But at the same time, I would conscientiously and very thoroughly do whatever duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2538)|
| 0:42:26| that come before the board and apply all the abilities that I possibly have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| to provide services for the people in my district and also for people all over Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| I want to applaud all the other applicants that are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| I think you've got a really good pool to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| I also want to applaud all the people that came in and spoke on behalf of those applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| and those who are yet to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| I've been on both sides of this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| I've been up there listening to people here, and, of course, I'm here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| It takes quite a bit of courage sometimes and conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| And for people to come and speak in public for something they believe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| is always due a great amount of respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| One thing that I've talked to some of the council people about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| is sometimes it takes two set of skills to be serving as a council person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| and also obtaining the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| One thing you have to do is you have to talk about yourself to get the attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| and to further yourself in the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| That's something that I've not always been comfortable doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| and I think a lot of you can identify with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| I'm much more comfortable talking about issues and things that I'm passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| But if you would allow me, I'm going to talk about the experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| that I have had that I think qualify me to serve the people of this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2628)|
| 0:43:56| One of the things is I'm a past member of the Business and Residential Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| of the Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| I'm also a past member of the Environment and Safety Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| of the Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| I was on the CAT Citizens Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| I was on the Knoxville Transportation Authority Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| I was on the Caswell Park Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I was president of the Knox Greenways Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| I was the chair of the James A.G. Memorial Park Steering Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| and I also have 20 years of practicing law in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| You have a resume, and it shows some of my general degrees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| One of the things, though, I actually wanted to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| in 1991 I was a member of the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| leadership class of 1991, and I think that shows that I've had a long-term interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| This is not a recent thing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| I've had a long-term interest in this community and making it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| This leadership class was an opportunity for people in all sectors of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| to come together and learn about the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| and I'm almost as proud of going through that class here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| as I am of almost any of the other degrees I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| I would like to talk a little bit specifically about some of the experience I obtained in some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| The Business and Residential Committee and the Environmental and Safety Committee in Oakwood-Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| that's where people get together and they talk about real nuts-and-bolts issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| I've been on those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I've been with those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| I know what comes up in these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| so that is not a world that's alien to me at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| and my neighbors and I have talked about all kinds of things about the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| basic stuff as well as broader policy things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| I was on both the CAT Citizens Advisory Board and the Knoxville Transportation Authority Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| because I have an interest in transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| I think it's an important part of any city as far as environmentally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| as far as getting people to work who might not have another way to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| and less traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| It's just transportation is one thing I think we have to be cognizant of if we really want to improve our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| One thing I wanted to mention, too, is when I was on the Transportation Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| I sat in the very same seats that some of you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| I'm very, very comfortable sitting in that seat, listening to people come up to this microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| listening attentively to them and asking them questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| and also discussing issues among the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| So this is not something that would be new to me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| I sat for four years on that Transportation Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| and so I wouldn't be exactly a newbie coming up and sitting behind that seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| and having people who had serious matters to them coming up here and wanting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| Mr. Thomas, your time is up, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| You have two persons signed up to speak on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| The first person is Connie Loy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| If you would come down and give your name and address, and you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| Connie Loy, 800 Oakwood Avenue in the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| I've known Charles for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| I'm past president of the Neighborhood Association when he served on these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| Charles is a very caring, giving neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| He loves his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| He loves the residents around Oakwood-Lincoln Park as well as throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2862)|
| 0:47:49| The things that he's done, the boards that he's served on, especially the CAT and the transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2869)|
| 0:47:58| He had a Lincoln Park bus route changed in order to get a bus to carry some of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| that had no transportation to a food store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| He worked very diligently to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| I'm very nervous standing here talking with you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| Don't you laugh at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| I'm filling in for Dr. Paul Kelly and his wife, Norma, who wanted to be here, but due to health they couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2898)|
| 0:48:26| He's not as eloquent as Dr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| Charles is a fine human being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| Like I said, he enjoys his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| He even took his expertise as far as for community work to Guatemala to work with the children and families there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2917)|
| 0:48:48| The city council would be blessed to have Charles to serve with you to finish out Mr. Becker's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2928)|
| 0:48:56| And I just strongly hope that you will consider him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Thank you, Ms. Loy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| The next person is Dr. Charles Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| If you would come down, give your name and address, and you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| My name is Charles Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| I live at 4178 Ridgeway Lane here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| Very pleased to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| In my 43 years of teaching at the University of Tennessee, I've been asked by several hundred students to write recommendations for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2964)|
| 0:49:33| Sometimes this has been a pleasant task, sometimes a very difficult one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| I immediately responded with enthusiastic yes when Charles Thomas asked me to speak on his behalf this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2978)|
| 0:49:46| because he is the perfect candidate to serve the 5th District on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| My wife, Terry, and I have known Charlie and supported many of his projects over the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| and we strongly recommend him to you for these reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| His record of service and his many accomplishments citywide prove his commitment to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| He has been very active not only in his own neighborhood, but also as co-founder and a long-time leader in the Knox Greenways Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3008)|
| 0:50:17| He has worked throughout the city to help residents and neighborhood organizations add greenways in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| Knoxville now has almost 50 miles of greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| Charlie served for many years on the Knoxville Transit Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| actively working to ensure that CAT patrons, who oftentimes can only rely on public transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| were provided access by bus to food, medical facilities, and other necessities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| Charlie has worked diligently to help design, fund, and acquire land for parks and green spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| He has often physically worked to help build them, as he did at the James Agee Park in the Fort Sanders community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| The above are only a few reasons that he should be seriously considered to fill Bob Becker's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3056)|
| 0:51:03| Charlie has been and will be a capable problem solver who listens, who values citizen input, and who is extremely fair-minded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3063)|
| 0:51:12| He will carefully consider all aspects of every issue which come before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| Simply put, you have the opportunity this afternoon to choose one of the best qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| most dependable, and most respected citizens in Knoxville for this fifth district seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| Thank you for this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Thank you, Dr. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| The next person is Mr. Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| If you would come down, give your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3099)|
| 0:51:51| My name is Joseph Lloyd Chuck Williams, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| The voters know me as Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| I live at 922 Oglewood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| I also have been living in the fifth district for at least the last five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| Before I begin, if I am the one that is appointed, I hereby pledge I will not seek this office or the at-large office during this upcoming election campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3125)|
| 0:52:20| It wouldn't be fair to the other candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| The reason I'm running, or not running but seeking the appointment, is because I've been out here throughout the entire city and the county dealing with all kinds of people's issues and problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3143)|
| 0:52:35| Having a bus route changed in Christianbury so that the bus would go down Dutch Valley so everybody could catch the bus instead of having to walk a mile up to Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3155)|
| 0:52:45| Fighting the previous county administration for four years to save the Murphy Library, which a lot of people don't even know it's in the L.T. Ross building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3165)|
| 0:52:54| Having to sit up here and take on a major soda distributor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| I won't say their name because they came through when they reneged on a promise to a local church in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3180)|
| 0:53:09| And various other problems with the violence that we've had in the streets and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| One of the main issues right now is we're facing hard economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| And a lot of you may remember earlier this year I submitted to you a plan as far as money that's owed the city as far as parking tickets are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3199)|
| 0:53:29| I also submitted a second one when we submitted our paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| I'm a realist realizing that this is just basically ten months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| And if you take a summer vacation, I guess eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| So really as a pointee, you're going to deal with the budget, which I have dealt with budgets on various levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3223)|
| 0:53:51| Maybe not on a city level, but I've also lived hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| I put myself through challenges without a job and a wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| So I know hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| I know how to deal with budgets and read line by line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| And right now my main concern is the budget, making sure the district is well represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| bridging the gap between the legacy that Vice Mayor Becker left behind, because nobody's going to fill his shoes, especially in ten months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3249)|
| 0:54:18| You're not going to be able to accomplish what he accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| Until the next person is elected by the electorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| That's the main function of the interim councilman right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| The other thing is trying to get money instead of through the city without having to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| Right now nobody wants to hear about taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| I know I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| And I believe so strongly in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| If I'm appointed, my boss is here, I'm handing him my resignation from a civil service job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3286)|
| 0:54:54| That's how strongly I believe in doing what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| And I believe I'm the right person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| The people know me throughout the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| I've been there for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| And I hope I'm the one picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Thank you, Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| You have one person signed to speak on your behalf, Mr. Robert Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| If you would come down and give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| And you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| Hello, I'm Robert Marlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| I live at 322 Douglas Avenue over in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| Ladies and gentlemen of the council, Mayor Brown, I'm the president of the Mechanicsville Neighborhood Watch Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| We're the largest neighborhood watch association in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| I also serve as the scoutmaster for InterCities Troop 99 that just formed over in Mechanicsville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| with the help of the Clinton Chapel AME Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| I also serve on the board with the Amplifier, Knoxville's first street paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| that's sponsored by Redeeming Hope Ministries over in the Fort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| I'm here tonight to urge you to select Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| And I give you my recommendation without reservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| I got to know Chuck a few months ago during the autumn election season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| when he was campaigning for Tennessee Senate District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| Chuck attended several of our neighborhood meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| He attended meetings in nearby Lonsdale and attended the Mechanicsville homecoming celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| And he participated and was actually the first candidate to commit and confirm to the Mechanicsville debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| that we hosted over at Clinton Chapel last October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| Throughout the election cycle I got to know Chuck very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| I was very inspired by him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| He was working the graveyard shift for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| And he was getting off work around 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| And he was going out and campaigning, knocking on doors, solving people's problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| fielding phone calls from people throughout the 5th District, the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| and even some out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| He would then go get a couple hours of sleep, wake up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| attend community functions like the Mechanicsville Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| functions in Lonsdale, functions all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| and then he would go punch his ticket and put in another shift for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| That was excruciating, just watching how tired he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| And that told me that he was very dedicated to improving the lives of those around him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| His zealous commitment to community service moved me to get involved with his campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| I wrote a letter of recommendation to the New Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| and I began publishing and passing out handbills all throughout the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3446)|

| 0:57:34| And I'm pleased to report that with $250 and approximately three weeks of hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| Chuck was able to manage to get approximately 2,500 votes in that election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3459)|

| 0:58:20| Ms. Mitchell, if you would let me say before she begins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| obviously we have some very able and qualified candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| and let me thank each person that's been here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| and those people who have spoken on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| And it does take something to come down and offer yourself for public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3516)|

| 0:59:02| the council member will respond with the name of the person for whom they wish to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3542)|

| 0:59:18| And I say spot because I think we've really got some impressive candidates, applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3558)|

| 0:59:29| and not cast my vote for several of you because I think you deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| And I really appreciate you applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| And so as we go along here, maybe I will have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3577)|

| 1:00:01| but Bob Becker has done a good job and we need somebody to pick up the ball and carry it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| And I think all six of these people could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=3606)|

| 1:10:33| Well, it would be the lowest number in ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| So if you have a round of voting and no one, and one person doesn't get a vote or three people don't get a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| you would eliminate either that one person or those three folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4242)|

| 1:11:25| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| They will be dropped after this round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4286)|

| 1:13:28| One vote for Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| Three votes for Roland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4410)|

| 1:13:34| One vote for Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| There were no votes in that round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| Well, there was a vote for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| So the lowest number was Eason and Williams tied with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| They would be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| We're now down to two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Roland and Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Roland and Thomas are the two remaining persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| We're now ready for round number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| If you would call the roll, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4445)|

| 1:14:33| They're both eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4473)|

| 1:14:44| What round is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4484)|

| 1:15:06| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| Four each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| I guess we're ready for the next round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Let me ask, and maybe this is premature at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| but I wonder at some point if we may want to question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| the two remaining candidates on issues or some other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| to provide more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| But I don't know what the other councilmembers feel about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| whether we're just going to cast ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| I think we could do that if we want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| but let's ask our legal advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| Well, you have adopted a procedure right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| If you want to change your procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| you can change your procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| It would simply take a motion to amend the rules to allow whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| procedure you desire, and you would have to adopt that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| by a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| Did you want to make a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| I'll forego it for the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| but at some point we may just be beating our head against the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| and if we had more facts on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| we might be able to make the tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| We had six good candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| We're down to two, and I guess we don't have a tiebreaker since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| there's not nine of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Yes, I just wanted to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| because we talked about some of these procedures via e-mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| procedures only, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| And it does take six votes to elect a candidate tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Well, seeing no further lights, I think we're ready for the next round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4604)|

| 1:16:49| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| Roland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4611)|

| 1:16:59| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| Mr. Roland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| Three votes for Roland, five votes for Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| Under the procedures that you have adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Mr. Roland would be eliminated and you would vote again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| unless you change your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| You have to have six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4642)|
| 1:17:29| Are you saying that Mr. Roland would be eliminated at this round already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| At this round, Mr. Roland would be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| You would have a next round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| and the only eligible person to receive votes would be Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| But if he did not receive six votes, he would not be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Then you have to decide what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| We will go to the next round, if that's all right with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4678)|

| 1:18:01| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4683)|

| 1:18:11| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4691)|

| 1:18:15| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| Do you want to declare your votes, Ms. Palmer or Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| If you'd give the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| That would be eight votes for Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| So we have a winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| Mr. Thomas, I think it is time for you to be sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| We need to take a ten-minute recess to allow time for Judge Rawson to come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| He's in court tonight, and so he was going to come over at short notice, and he will be here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| Before that, let me recognize Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4750)|
| 1:19:11| I just wanted to thank everyone who put their name in the hat, who came and applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| who showed us that they have the good intent and the right stuff to try to lead our city forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| It's not been easy voting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| It's not a popularity contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| We've had to make decisions, and I'm not so sure that they, you know, would come out different if we stayed all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| But I do think that each one of you is certainly to be congratulated and thanked for your public spirit, and we do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110120?start=4774)|
