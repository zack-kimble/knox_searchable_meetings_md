| 0:00:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=38)|
| 0:00:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=39)|
| 0:00:40| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=40)|
| 0:00:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| Okay, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| We have nine applicants tonight and four from previous times and two hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=43)|
| 0:00:48| So in order to keep this moving along in the time we have, when I call your name, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=48)|
| 0:00:54| come to the podium and say your name and address very loudly so that we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| And then we'll proceed from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=59)|
| 0:01:01| The first applicant is the Cafe Four on Four Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=61)|
| 0:01:13| Good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Jim Clonaris, home address 719 Luttrell Street, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=74)|
| 0:01:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| Sergeant, we have a different person tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| Sergeant Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| For him, we have no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| What about the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, the health department approval, and the permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| We also have a couple of people, Megan Fowler and Brian Mitchell, who have not had the background check or fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=100)|
| 0:01:48| They both have had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| And we already submitted the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| Maybe we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| I have the sales tax number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| The health department's been contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| They came and did a check, I think, yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| But these people, when did they submit their fingerprints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| I believe Brian did his yesterday, maybe two days ago, and Megan also within the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=132)|
| 0:02:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| Actually, Megan Fowler was already, I think she was already in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| I think she actually went to the task today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Well, we don't have the background check for her yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| So that needs to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| So we're the previous owners changing FEIN, so she's an existing manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Does she need to do a background check again since she's currently the manager of Cafe 4, still remaining the manager of Cafe 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=167)|
| 0:02:56| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Well, you all did submit a brand new application with her name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=178)|
| 0:03:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| Yes, it's new ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| So the manager would need to have, as detailed on the application, a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Now, the background check that was done today has not come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| It will take, what, three or four days to get back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| So that's not in yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| So what we have is some outstanding items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| Mr. Councilman Della Vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Yeah, I just wanted to ask to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| You're shifting the ownership and management, but it's the same business being continued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| It's a little complicated, but we're separating the restaurant from the existing entity and starting a new entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=223)|
| 0:03:54| It starts January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| The next council meeting is January, or the next beer board meeting is January the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=237)|
| 0:04:03| So you would be able to continue operating as you are through the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| Mr. Frost, do you want to give us some advice what to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| Well, generally speaking, the policy of this board is to defer an applicant until everyone has been in for their fingerprint and background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=253)|
| 0:04:24| They're obviously still in business right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| They can continue in business as is until everything is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| But unfortunately, rather than January 1st, until everything gets passed by the beer board, you'd have to wait until then, sir, assuming that it's deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=272)|
| 0:04:42| So let me see if I understand correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| We can operate without interruption, or do we stand interrupted on January 1 through the 19th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| Well, if you give up your beer permit on December 31st, you could not get your new beer permit until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=294)|
| 0:05:07| I don't pretend to tell people how to operate their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| Or you can keep operating under that beer permit until, assuming everything gets taken care of by January 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=310)|
| 0:05:24| If the entity changes hands on December 31, we're no longer operating as Four Market Square Entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=324)|
| 0:05:33| Can I continue to sell beer under the new Cafe Four LLC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| So there will be an interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| And this is basically because we're lacking sales tax identification number and the two fingerprint background checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=346)|
| 0:05:54| Basically, it's the fingerprint and background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| We've got the fingerprint and background has been done for Brian Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| But Megan Fowler, even though she's done this in the past, it's a whole new operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| She has to have it done again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| So she needs to get into KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| The number is on the letter of application, and she needs to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| She had the fingerprinting, but they haven't had a chance to look up her background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| So she's already in, I think, the system, but it's going to take a while to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| But it has to be processed, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| Counselman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| I move we defer until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Which would be January the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Is it possible that they could remove Megan Fowler from the application and have it approved under Brian Mitchell and James Clonaris or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=398)|
| 0:06:46| Well, Brian Mitchell, we don't have his records back yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| We don't have his back yet either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| But we have James'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| I withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| We have no record for Mr. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| We have no record for Mr. Clonaris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| As far as Megan Fowler goes, she came in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| She was actually fingerprinted today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| So she is the entity that we have right now that we do not have the information on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| So we have to defer because that information hasn't come through yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| That would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Since she has come in, I think typically we've adopted this policy because people need to come in before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=437)|
| 0:07:26| She technically has come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| We've heard from the officer she has come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Does that meet our policy of she's come in for the background check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| Well, on your desk tonight, you have a letter that goes out with the applications for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| It's from KPD, and it very specifically says what you have to do and when you have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| And, you know, this was put in place to prevent this very situation from occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| And obviously ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| I guess everybody knows my position, but if anybody else ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| We've heard your position before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Just a minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| We can still discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| Do we have his record back here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| We can still discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Let's think about this for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Well, yeah, let's think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| This one's a little unusual than any of the other ones that I believe we've ‑‑ that I remember anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| Where you have an existing business, the same people, the same people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| haven't gotten it done, and we're denying it based on getting the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=511)|
| 0:08:47| Is that what we're waiting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| I think this is a clear example that this is truly ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| I don't recall this ever being the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| even though most of the time I stand against Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| I think this is time for an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| I would make a motion that we approve it subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| We have that motion, but we still have an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| If you could remove Megan tonight orally, Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| Well, you have a motion to defer is what you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| Yeah, but I'm trying to keep that from having to happen, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| If you could remove Megan orally tonight, Ms. Dyer, would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| And then we have the information for Brian Mitchell and Mr. Clarence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| and we could go ahead and approve the permit tonight, and then Megan can get her stuff together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| Would that work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Yeah, I believe you're going to find that it already is together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| I'm sure that it is, but the records are not back with the police department that they need to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| So now I've got to ask a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| So let's say we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Megan's my GM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Does that mean she can't be the manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| It means that she needs to get her stuff together and then resubmit the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| or tell me, Ms. Dyer, what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| Well, but certainly to your purview, if that's acceptable to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| that he orally removes her as a manager and then follows that up with an email, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| She does have another manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| I mean, Brian Mitchell is listed as a manager as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| So you would be able to operate with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| If you wanted to add her back as a manager, you would then need to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| She would be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| I just have to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| I think we called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Who all has the tax certification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I think we called the city county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| I think we called the office, the tax office, and they said since Megan had already been background checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| that she was currently clear and still is that she didn't have to go back, but we did anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=645)|
| 0:10:54| So I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| Well, obviously the person who told you that was confused also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| because when a new application comes in for a new entity, it's like everybody starts from ground zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| And so unfortunately for you, that's the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| So if you opted to remove her as the manager, send an e-mail tomorrow to Ms. Dyer or Ms. Day doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=671)|
| 0:11:21| and then once she gets the records checked back, then she can put it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| But you also have a business tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| Who completed the task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Do we know who completed the task?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Mr. Klonaris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| She has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| And Mr. Mitchell and Megan has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| So all of them have, not just her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Mr. Frost, I want to clarify for Mr. Klonaris here that she can still remain as the manager of the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=700)|
| 0:11:48| Removing her from this beer license should not affect her ability to manage that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Everybody up here is trying to come up with a way that's complying with the law and works and helps you all out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| If you just orally remove her tonight and send the confirming e-mail later on tonight or tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| it's just then you can be approved if the beer board approves you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| And then she, as a manager, she's probably going to have to fill out some more paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| and then go through the process, and then it should get back onto your all's planned timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| But you don't miss a beat in terms of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| So I will orally remove Megan Fowler from the beer board application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| And I'll follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| I'd like to withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| And I'll second Councilman Wallace's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| The referral's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| He's now going to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| I just want to, I guess, remind everybody if we just went to the original way we used to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| we could have saved 15 minutes and passed this pending final documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| and saved a lot of heartache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| It's just another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| It seems like it happens almost every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| That's pretty rare right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| That's pretty rare right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| I mean, we had Holly's Market two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| So anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Councilman Stair, I appreciate your persistence on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| You only need to wear down four other people and then we'll change the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| So keep on plugging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| It's times like these I just think it's important to remind the board that we're torturing us and the businesses needlessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| And we would be disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Come on, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Let's get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Vice Mayor Pavlis, did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Councilman Wallace did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| Repeat that motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| My motion is we approve this pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| And good luck with your career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Sorry, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Your old business going on as a new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| Next we have the Dollar General Store on Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=849)|
| 0:14:18| The Dollar General Store on Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| Construction is not yet quite complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| Ms. Day, do you want to fill us in on what's happened with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| Would you repeat, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| I was in a conversation behind me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| The Dollar General Store on Amherst had Jim Sullivan, I believe, as the background, as the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| But he's actually the district manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| So now they have a new person who was appointed like today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| So that's the scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| The manager came in our office this morning, filled in the form, and they whisked over to task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| And I think they did make the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Is that right, officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Yes, ma'am, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| He was actually fingerprinted today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| So we have not received him as the same thing we filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| We have not received the results back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| But we didn't know this was the district manager until just the other day, and they wanted to make the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| This is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| So I move that we defer to the January 19th meeting pending getting back this Princeton thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| He's not operating, so they're not hurt by coming to the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| No, they're not hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| They're not open yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| I'll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Halston Hills Country Club, LLC applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=928)|

| 0:15:39| Madam Chair, I move that we move this item to heal the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Excuse me, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| The owner of Halston Hills Country Club is out of state, and they had difficulties getting his records checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| And we did get the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| They sent them to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| I sent them to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| But they kind of, the roundabout way, requested a deferral to the next month because they just assumed that that would be what would happen since they didn't have the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=959)|
| 0:16:10| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Would you like to change your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| I'll move that we defer this to the next board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Which is January the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| January the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=977)|

| 0:16:22| We'll move right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Do you want to just approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=983)|

| 0:16:43| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1007)|

| 0:16:53| And this application covers the Rossini Festival, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Let me ask one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| I notice it's down for one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Now, do you have a whole weekend planned, or is this just the 23rd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Just the one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Just Saturday, the 23rd of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1031)|

| 0:17:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| 4136 Idlewild Drive, Fort Worth, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Is the record check complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| We have no record for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| We need the building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Are you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Timothy Love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Timothy Love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| I know that you have some inspections that are not done, and that's kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Unfortunately, I'm real ignorant to this process, but I'm trying to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| So we're about to start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| So every other place I've applied for liquor licenses in the country, you always get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| ahead before you even start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| So do we need to have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| We've obviously got a building permit for all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| The department's approved and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Just to help ease your mind, once you move along in construction and different groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| come out and inspect your progress, when you're all finished with construction, they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| notify the business tax office, and they will issue your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| Now, I believe you've completed the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| My manager has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Your manager has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| So what we're waiting for is to get the construction done and for you to start serving food once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| this beer board approves, assuming they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| Councilman Dellavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| Yeah, what's the target date for opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Where were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Mid-March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Mid-March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Are we deferring this, or just pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| I think we're pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Tell us a little bit about your business, because we've been reading about it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| paper, but it sounds exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Yeah, Lonesome Dove is a fine dining establishment based around wild game, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1139)|
| 0:19:06| The original one is in Fort Worth, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| There's one in Austin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| This will be the third one here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Sounds neat, and a very historic old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| It's a great building, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| I had beers there when I was a kid when I went to school here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| Were you legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| That was last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| That was last week, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| I think several people on this beer board have had that experience at one time or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| Yeah, it's a great building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| I'm looking forward to fixing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Well, we're excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| And then you have another restaurant you're opening in another part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Right next door to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| I should be under the same license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| All right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| All right, do I have a motion to approve pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Well, good luck with your new restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| And now, when you get all these inspections done, we'll just need to pick up the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| from the business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| So we won't be seeing you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Okay, next is Mulligan's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| And Ms. Day, do you want to say something about Mulligan's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| They are requesting an additional deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| They're still having some construction issues that they were not, I think, aware of when they first rented the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| So they apologize profusely, but they would like to be deferred to the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Okay, a couple of things about Mulligan's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| They haven't been in for the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| And the building they're going into is the old Sunny's location on Peters Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| and that's a pretty old building, so I can understand why they would have a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| They also have their LLC and current city business license that they've got to get straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| So they have a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| So maybe by January the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| They knew what the rule was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| See, they knew what the rule was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| They are aware that they have to do their background check and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| Yes, they are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| They're very aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| I think their previous location was in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| and they came under the county or in the Farragut laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| Okay, next is the one-stop market on Wilson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| Did you pass your Mulligan out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| 2701 Wilson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| And your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Omar Al-Dabashi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Sergeant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| We have no record for that, and the task is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Ms. Dyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| We need the building inspection approval and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. DeLolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| I take it this is off-premise consumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| In other words, you're just selling the beer, but you're not serving it in the building, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| No, just sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Because there was a location issue with abundant health care, but it's off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| So that will be when you get these inspections done, check with the office and pick up your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Back up a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| We didn't have a motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| File documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Now you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Next is the Sunday Night Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| I'm a little curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| What's the fourth degree of assault?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Fourth degree of assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Actually, I think it's something in a different state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Sunday Tail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Address is 247 Endicott Avenue, Alcoa, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| Task is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| We have no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Mr. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| We need a copy of the sales tax registration, certificate of zoning from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| and the building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| So we have a few pieces of information that need to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| I do have the sales tax number here, and I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| I think I need a lot of inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| I'm still working on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| So I just want to make sure first that I can qualify for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| So in the interim, I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| So you can proceed to build and get ready to pick up your permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| once you get all the inspections finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Do you want to tell us about your operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Because that was a deli previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| So you're doing something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| It's going to be like a lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| It's going to be like a restaurant and a little bar entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Next is the VIP event center on Mohegan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1429)|
| 0:23:59| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| My name is Juad Rivera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| It's 104 South David Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Sir, we have a problem with the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| On your application, it was indicated that Bearden Methodist was the closest church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| when, in fact, the closest church is the AME church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| It's only 229 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| So because it's not 300 feet or more, this body cannot issue you a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1462)|
| 0:24:31| The law in the city of Knoxville is you must be 300 feet from a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| a hospital, a funeral home, or a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| And on the application, the wrong church was put down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| The closest church to your business on Mohegan is the AME church, and it's only 229 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1484)|
| 0:24:53| I was not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Well, if you go down the street there past your building, the church is very visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| It's maybe half a block from the building on Mohegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| It's on Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| The church is actually on Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| But it's about half a block from this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Can we inquire whether he has a TBA license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| No, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| We cannot inquire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| No, we cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Is that a new church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| No, that church has been there for close to 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| It's a small church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| As you're going on Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| I guess the reason I'm asking this is because that location prior had a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| And that location's license lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| And so it's like we're starting from square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| I don't know how they got the license previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| I was not part of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| I don't know if the license had been kept effective by previous owners or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| But the license has lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| And so you're starting from square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| And it is too close to that church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| So we will have to not consider your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1575)|
| 0:26:25| That's a kick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1585)|
| 0:26:34| I need a motion to deny the application pending the distance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| We now have four items on the addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Market House Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| Ms. Day, do you want to tell us what you know about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| I spoke with Bernadette West earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| I thought she was going to be here, so I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| But she did say they were still having some construction issues at the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| And she apologized again profusely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| She said she was going to request another 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| To December 19th, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| No, to January the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| January the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1640)|

| 0:27:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| So we'll hear Market House again on January the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Frisky Bend Bar and Dance Club on North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| You all started in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| 3809 Thrall Road, Knoxville, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Tell us where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Well, we'll be calling next week for our CO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| and all of our inspections will be calling for them next week to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| I think that's all we're lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| So you basically are still getting inspections finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| And you started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| They've been out and done walk-throughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| and then they told us some things we need to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| and so we've had to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| And you started this in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| I'm sure you didn't anticipate it would take this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| No, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Do I have a motion to extend this another 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| So the status is that it's approved as pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| We're just giving you additional time to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Good luck, and I hope you're done by January the 19th, and I know you do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Next is the Balter Beer Works on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1704)|
| 0:28:33| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| I'm David Wedekind, 2512 Hauser Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| And we're looking at two permits for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Let's take the on and off premise first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| Or I guess just tell us about your issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| You're not construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| We've just had some construction delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| I think we're down on 100 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| The corner with Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| We've had some problems with some unsuitable soils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| and we've had to remove some rock and just some general delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| Our hiring center is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| We've hired over 30 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| and we're well underway right now to get open by the 1st of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1750)|
| 0:29:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| But as I understand it, we only have 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| and after that time we need to request additional time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| and that's why we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| We'd like to ask for 60 days per Ms. Day's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| Thank you, Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| So that we can get past the January meeting and go into the February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| This is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| I move that we grant the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| That's in the 6th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| It's in the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Oh, it says 4th on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| Oh, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| I was on the wrong page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| We're neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| So the 6th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| So are you going to go along with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| So we have a motion for 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| and we hope you get it all completed then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| The Schultz Brau Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| Schultz Brau Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| This is in the 4th district, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Did we have to vote on both those permits, or did we combine them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| We're good for the – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Nico Schultz, 178 Nicole Chase Lane, 37924 Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| And you are not finished with construction, I'll bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| So we basically have the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Construction is taking a lot longer than we had hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| So we would also like to request a 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| I will move that we extend it for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Good luck to both of your locations, though they're your competitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| Now we go to the administrative hearings, the fun part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| The first is Cheddar's Casual Cafe, 5615 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1860)|
| 0:31:09| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| I'm Jimmy Holbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| I'm counsel for Mint Joy Restaurant Group doing business with Cheddar's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| My address is 1563 Lewisbrook Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| That's down in Farragut, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| And we are here and want to just go ahead and state, to start things out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| that we certainly do apologize for the situation that occurred that brought us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| It's one of those situations where we don't tolerate that and we have a zero-tolerance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| I know that the Board's aware that you've gotten our submission that details out some of the things we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| and I'm happy to go over that with you briefly and entertain any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| I've also brought our regional manager here, Jerry Stewart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| as well as the general manager of the Clinton Highway location, Matt Bradford, with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| and they also would be happy to entertain any questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| First off, I will let you know that with regard to this particular incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| just as with any time this would ever happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| we have had and continue to have going forward a zero-tolerance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| The individual involved in this case that apparently misread the date on the identification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1943)|
| 0:32:31| was terminated immediately once this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| and we hate that to be the case because he was otherwise a long-term valued employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| But we have a zero-tolerance policy, and that continues to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| Ironically, Cheddar's was in the process of making some updated changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| We're not a reactionary group where we just sit there and wait until something happens and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| oh, maybe we should make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| This is something we're constantly going through and trying to make improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| to help assure that these kind of incidents don't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| Cheddar's is a family-oriented restaurant that just happens to serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| We're not a bar. We're not anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| This is something that is a priority for us to have safety and whatnot as a priority and our primary concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| We were already in the process of going through at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| and we have finished that process even before this incident happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| of getting these nice little cards that we have now issued to all of our servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| which go over the ID and help them to stay focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| As well, we've also got a system now in place where we actually have them enter the date electronically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| and that prints out on the ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| And what we're doing also is having them subject to random reviews of this by the managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2031)|
| 0:34:00| Each of the servers is subject to having a manager review and make sure that they are, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| accurate with the information that they're entering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| This had been an issue before where customers actually found it a little bit irritating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| because they didn't want to have to show their ID a second time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| but we have just made the decision, and we've been contemplating it for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| that we need to do the double checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| And that's what we've done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| In addition to that, before when we did our sort of education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| and checklist with our different servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| we had alcohol as part of our list of questions that we asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| to make sure that they understood the proper procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| And it was always included, but now we have enhanced that, made it a completely separate document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| And with regard to the Clinton Highway location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| we have already gone through and done the retesting with all 63 servers there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| and they've all gone through and signed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| and they all passed it on the first time, which is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| That tells us something positive as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| These changes that we were working on already are actually being implemented statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| So this is not just something we're doing, again, as some kind of reaction to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| A lot of this was already in process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| and we're going to continue to make changes and enhancements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| There are multiple electronic things that are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| that are getting more and more user-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| and something that we can actually reasonably implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| that we're already looking at for the future card readers and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| So we're looking to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| But we've made quite a few changes and enhancements to help prevent this from happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| Obviously, we're ultimately at the mercy of the point-of-service employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| which is why we are making sure that they understand the importance of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| And while we continue to maintain a zero-tolerance policy, that will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| That is something that we are very serious about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| And like I said, even in this case, we have a very otherwise great employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| but they're no longer an employee and were terminated immediately as a result of this incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| And so we hope to prevent any sort of future incidents from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| The state of Tennessee, as mentioned in this letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| has already agreed to a seven-day suspension of our alcohol permit as part of the process with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2180)|
| 0:36:30| And that's going to occur in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| So we feel that we've already made enough changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| and we certainly are continuing to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| and will continue to do so regardless of what the determination is of this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| because we have our own direct conscience and responsibility to make these changes as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| But we believe that the fine and the changes we've made hopefully are enough to satisfy the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2212)|
| 0:37:00| that we are worthy of continuing to maintain our license without interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| But if the board were to choose to have a temporary suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| we would ask that if this could coincide with the state suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| it would be an opportunity for us to be able to use that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| We're already intending to do it, but it would be an opportunity for us to use that week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| in order to have further education of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| And as I read through your new plan compared to the first time this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| obviously you've made very significant changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| I understand that for a server, when somebody is older than 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| and they are the age of several of the beer board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| if we're asked for an ID, sometimes some people are not very nice about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| But I also am sympathetic to the server not getting into trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| We do not have from the TABC yet the fine and the date of the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| How much was your fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| There was no fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| There was no fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Just a seven-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| And we just have to have that served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| We get to choose the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| We just have to have it begin by January, I believe it's the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| Yeah, January the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Now, this Cheddar's is in my district, so I don't ever want to see you all in here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Counselor DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Yeah, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| One of the things that you mentioned was a card or license reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| Would you just describe what the process is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Well, again, right now what we have is these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| which just go over the licenses, the tenancy licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| which help to keep the employee focused on the date and the other relevant information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| And then also they then have to take a secondary step of entering that into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| which now prints out on a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Before, that was not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| What I was mentioning is we're just looking at the possibilities of the card readers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| and whatnot in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Electronically checking the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| That has not been implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| And that's something that's still in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| I think there's – it's worked in a few other states, but Tennessee has some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| so we're still kind of – you've got to coordinate that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Do you post the magic date every day, or what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Do you post the cutoff date or whatever it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Yes, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| So that they're able, before they start to shift, to pay attention to what's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| And in this particular case, it was a situation where apparently they misread the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| The officer that came in for this thing or whatever, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| was maybe two months or so shy of the birth date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| and I think they misread the month is my general understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| But regardless, that's not an excuse, and that's why he was terminated immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Now, beer board, we have to make a couple of – we have to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| We can accept their plan as a huge step compared to their past plan they submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| and the TABC suspension, or we can send this to the hearing officer once we get the TABC information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2396)|
| 0:40:08| and the hearing officer can decide if there would be additional penalties or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| So, Counselman DeLaVoca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| I would move that we accept their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| They seem sincere about what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| I'm a little surprised that they actually had to terminate the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| I wonder if reeducation wouldn't be a better method or some whack in their paycheck or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2424)|
| 0:40:31| But we don't insist on that here, and that may be your corporate policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| That certainly gets people's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| But I would move that we accept the current penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| I just wanted to follow up on his comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| As a rule, this beer board does not look kindly upon an employee being terminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| without an opportunity to do something, you know, change their ways or another – a second chance, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2454)|
| 0:41:03| Madam Chair, is that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Because they can go to another place to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| Madam Chair, is that really the position of the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I don't remember us ever taking a position on that, and I frankly think it's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| You think it's inappropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| If you want to state your individual position on whether an employee should be terminated or not, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| But to say that's the position of the beer board, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| Well, we've had this come up in the past, and no one on the beer board has questioned it previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| But I'll make a note that you have questioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| I have questioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| I remember it specifically in a meeting that legally it's – if you have a person that sells underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| and then you don't fire them and that person sells again, you are more liable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| You're negligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| It's basically negligent retention of an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Well, that person –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| So I think this beer board giving bad legal advice is not our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| It's not the position we should take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Well, that person can go from Cheddar's on Clinton Highway to another place on Clinton Highway and get a job that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| So that – it was just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| In terms of that entity's legal liability, that's irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| Well, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| So I think that – and in my personal opinion, I think employers that terminate, they take underage drinking serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| What if it was spousal abuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Do you reeducate them or do you say we don't tolerate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| There's a great deal of difference between selling to underage and spousal abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| Well, you're just saying it's not serious enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Excuse me. Your time's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Vice Mayor Pavlis, you've commented about this in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| This was a concern of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Well, you know, I've given my personal opinion of, you know, immediate dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2561)|
| 0:42:49| I mean, I think that Councilwoman or the chair makes a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| They can go – you know, jobs are – you can change jobs in that industry very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2575)|
| 0:43:03| And just me personally, I mean, I would rather see – you stated in your letter they were a good employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2583)|
| 0:43:11| They could have gone to another, you know, non-serving position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| You know, I've invested a lot of money or the corporation has invested a lot of money in an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| And any time that you terminate them – and I'm not obviously condoning what they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| but, I mean, I've made that statement in the past, and I really – it was just a personal statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| It was just something having pretty good knowledge of how the industry works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I don't know what that really accomplishes, though you do make a statement that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| I'm not going to get into telling you how to run your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| I mean, I think it came from Nick before as a personal statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| It didn't come from the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| And, you know, this employee cost his company thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| And that's their prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| And I think that that's their prerogative to terminate an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| If they take it seriously, it costs them a lot of money to hire a lawyer and come down and do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| Plus the fine, it's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| And they have every right to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| It's not our right to tell them how to run their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| So it came from Nick before as a personal opinion, but not from the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| I think Starr's right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Councilman De La Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I don't want to agree with Marshall Starr only to this extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| It seems to me that he's thinking, as a personnel lawyer and as a counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2667)|
| 0:44:35| that we oughtn't to be putting the company in that position one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| I think it's good to express your personal views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| I could see selling to a second minor who goes out and has a terrible wreck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| and mommy and daddy sue the living pants off the company for having sort of a loose cannon on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| So it's the corporate decision of where they want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| and I think we oughtn't to make it an official policy as opposed to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| I just said that we didn't insist on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| That's not our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| But they may find that it enlightens every other employee on the staff to really look carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| because you're going to lose your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| So I think we ought to keep our nose out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| And, like, you can only have a good decision made if you hear multiple points of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| So we thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Next is Echo Bistro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| Employees sold to a minor on June 16, 2015, and September 3, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2733)|
| 0:45:42| I'm Tyler Roper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| I'm here with the permittee, Seth Simmerman of Echo Bistro and Wine Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| And the address of the business is 5803 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Do you want to tell us anything about the circumstances of these two sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| First, I'd like to say there was a prior administrative beer hearing on October 27th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| and I was actually engaged as counsel at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| and I was engaged to submit the remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| and also to get everything in order for the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| And at the time, I had it scheduled wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| and I was sitting for John Rawson, who was out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| and I received a phone call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| and I raced down here to try to catch this hearing before it ended so that I wouldn't miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| But I do apologize for my absence and for my client's absence at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| This meeting, we're here tonight because there was a second occurrence and a second citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2803)|
| 0:46:52| and if I could go through the history, I think it's necessary to understand sort of how we got here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| On June 16th of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| there was the first citation was issued for the sale to an underage person by Tommy Schwartz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| who is the bartender at Echo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| And just so you know, if you haven't been there, Echo is a white tablecloth dining establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| It's a little more expensive fare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| They do offer alcohol and beer, and I do recommend the food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| It's delicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| And it happens that Mr. Simmerman is also my father-in-law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| so it is made for a very uncomfortable Thanksgiving and couldn't make for a very uncomfortable Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| We don't get this resolved, but it is serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Do you like Brussels sprouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| It is a very serious situation that we have found ourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| The bartender was cited on June 16th as well as the permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| After that, there was a remedial plan that was prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| It was handwritten, and I believe it was given to the officer, and it was also given to me to transcribe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| and I failed to do that in a timely manner for the hearing last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| On September 3rd, not too long after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| there was a second citation given to Mr. Schwartz as well as the business for selling to an underage person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2900)|
| 0:48:28| and both of those were the subject of a sting by the ABC board and not our local police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2908)|
| 0:48:37| although they did accompany them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| On September 4th, we received a letter from the city notifying us of the date, October 27th, not the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2920)|
| 0:48:49| After we missed that, I then contacted the city law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| We submitted our remedial plan and paid the $500 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| and on that same day that we submitted that, we had been in contact with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2939)|
| 0:49:06| As you know, they also work on these files as well because we have a liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| and we entered into an agreed order with the state for a 15-day suspension in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| It will be from January 5th to the 23rd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| and the reason there's more than 15 days there is that they're not open on Sunday and Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| so we have that that's going to happen here in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| And so what I've done, upon advice of a lot of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| this is actually my first time here on one of these hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| so it's a new experience for me and it's a new experience for Mr. Simmerman and for ECHO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| We have transcribed his initial remedial plan, and I included that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| Hopefully you have that with a letter as well as the exhibits that are attached to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and we have included a second corrective measure and remedial plan that would be Exhibit C on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| Already, Mr. Simmerman has paid, or ECHO has paid, $1,500 to the state for the first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| and as I've said earlier, we've got the 15-day suspension that's coming up for the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| And so we are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Also, as a result of the last hearing, there's been a noncompliance complaint filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| That was on November 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| We had our pre-hearing conference on December 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| in which we agreed to postpone that pending any action that would be taken by this board tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| and that is scheduled out for February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| Barring any unforeseen, hopefully if we are allowed to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| and with our bear permit and there's no additional penalties by this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| we anticipate there will be an agreed disposition of the noncompliance complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| which will result in an extra $1,500 fine on top of the $500 that's already been paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| as well as a 7-day suspension that may either coincide or not coincide with the other suspension for the liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| That sort of explains the procedural history and how we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| If I may, I'd like to explain about the bartender and then the corrective measures that have been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| Actually, we need to hear from a couple of members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| and the corrective measures for the bartender we'll deal with later. Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| I'm a little confused here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| So you've paid $500, you've got $1,500 more coming that you're going to have to pay, and a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3092)|
| 0:51:41| We anticipate, since this is a second violation and under the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| when we missed the administrative hearing the first time on October 27th, by statute a noncompliance complaint must issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3106)|
| 0:51:56| And that entails, and because there is a second violation, we have an extra $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3116)|
| 0:52:05| I'm sorry, because it gets to that level, there's an extra $1,500 that goes into effect on top of the $500 for a total of $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3125)|
| 0:52:13| To the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| To the city, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Plus a 15-day suspension with a 7-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| It is confusing, and I'll try to make it a little more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| Well, I just want to make sure that I'm hearing. I mean, that's substantial, and I just want to make sure I'm hearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| So with the state, we've paid, on the first offense, you paid $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| The second offense, you don't have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| You have to either go down to Nashville and have a hearing or enter into an agreed disposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| which is what we did with the state's attorney, and that agreed disposition was the 15-day suspension in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3163)|
| 0:52:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| That does not include an additional fine, but that in and of itself obviously is a penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| But then you said there's a potential or another 7-day suspension on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| Well, my understanding is, and you all probably know this better than I do, is that the city used to mirror what the state would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3181)|
| 0:53:10| and so we anticipated that there would be a 15-day suspension for the beer permit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| And that, coupled with the fact that since we had not paid the $500 and submitted the remedial plan like we should have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3196)|
| 0:53:25| and because of the way the ordinance is written, that there would be an additional $1,500 fine for a total of $2,000 with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3205)|
| 0:53:33| as well as a 15-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Now I understand that the beer board has discretion as to what type of suspension it may impose, if any at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| I mean, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| I just wanted to make sure I was hearing what I thought I was hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| And, I mean, we want to hear from Councilman Della Vopi as well, but this is not a high-volume bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| I mean, I've eaten there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| It's not, you know, I think with what I've seen that's been put in place, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| I'm comfortable moving forward with the fines that they've been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| I mean, that's substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Fifteen days of losing alcohol sales is a big deal to a non-well, I mean, I'm sure they do good business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3248)|
| 0:54:16| but it's not a Cheddar's, for example, that does a, you know, huge volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| So that is in relationship to that's a huge fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| So anyway, I still want to hear from Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Yeah, I'm going to basically mirror those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| This is more of a fine dining restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| There's a small bar in the entryway where folks might have a glass of wine while they wait for their group to gather up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3277)|
| 0:54:46| and sit down for dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| It's not a hit-and-run place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| You might be there two hours if you have a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| And it appears that they've finally gotten the notion that they can't rely on the bartender to simply do routine business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3291)|
| 0:55:03| They're going to have these daily checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| They're going to make him wear his glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| They're going to make him note the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| They're taking it serious, and they've had an economic penalty that's got their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| I know Mr. Simmerman going back 20 years when he was at Club LeConte as the manager and executive chef there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3316)|
| 0:55:25| He's a very serious, what, food purveyor in Knoxville, and it's unfortunate that they let this get out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| I'm assuming from this remedial plan and from the sting that they intend to right the ship and go forward that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| I think the punishment's been significant enough that we ought to give them a shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| and they better be wise and not let it happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Your establishment is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| Please pull your microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| Can I hear now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Your establishment is in my district, and I think that I definitely agree with Vice Mayor Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| and also with Mr. Della Vopi in terms of at least the program that you've set forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| I would like to say that even though it is a fine dining, that they still have a responsibility to card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| and to make sure that there is no liquor served underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| I mean, that's regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| It doesn't matter whether you're a fine dining or a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| But I do think with what you're going through, it's obvious that you're trying to make amends for what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| I just hope that we don't see Thomas's name again after seeing it twice on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| He will die in my kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| He will die in my kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| But we may see his name on the front page of the newsletter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| It's a different kind of terminate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| So, Madam Chair, what kind of motion do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Mr. Frost, do we need a motion to let the actions that have been taken stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| Accept it and move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| I move we accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| And we really mean this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| We don't want to see any of you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| You're nice people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| We'd love to eat at your restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| But you don't want to be back for us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| We've been five years of this, and I've never been so embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| I just can't imagine it happened twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| But, you know, he just wouldn't wear glasses, but he wears them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| I bet so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Being no further business, this board is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151217?start=3438)|
