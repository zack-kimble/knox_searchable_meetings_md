| 0:02:24| The only thing that has come up is that there is on our consent some ice cream approving contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| and I'd like to know how we go about getting the samples so that we can know whether we need to approve that contract or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=151)|
| 0:02:39| Yeah, we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=159)|

| 0:03:26| I do have a consent numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| There are several of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| I'll go through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| If there's anything that any commissioner would like to pull off for discussion, please make note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| So on consent, I'm recommending item number 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=217)|

| 0:04:35| 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=275)|
| 0:04:57| Does any commissioner want to withdraw any of those or have any of those pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| Do we need to even come to the meeting next Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| It depends on how you vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| I guess I just had a question on 14, so I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| So we'll take that one off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| Are there any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=318)|

| 0:05:25| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=328)|

| 0:05:36| Do I hear a motion that we approve the amendments to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| I said amendments to the minutes of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| It is noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| On page one, item number four, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| appointing, nominated by the Chancellor of the Board of Regents to the Knox County Air Pollution Control Board, resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| I understand we had a recommendation for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| Is there someone here to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| I was told that they were going to recommend a candidate for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| If not, could we have a motion that we send this on without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=376)|

| 0:06:19| We'll take it up on next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| On page three, item number 14, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| appointing the pact agreement with Trane U.S. Inc. for the phase 3A of the self-funded energy conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=392)|
| 0:06:41| and infrastructure improvement program for Knox County schools and amendment number 2 to the phase 2 pact agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| with Trane U.S. Inc. to address a broader renovation effect of the Gresham Middle School Resolution 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Yeah, I just wanted to ask representatives from the school board if they could just kind of give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| or us an understanding of what this phase 2 is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| Is there a different payback schedule in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| Well, I guess this is phase 3A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| And the whole, I guess, notion of self-funding, and I think what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| So correct me if I'm incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| Your big boss just walked in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| He may want to address that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| So I'm assuming from self-funded, meaning that Trane's laying out the additional funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=451)|
| 0:07:39| and then we have to write them kind of a payback check each year over the lifetime of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| And then just kind of discuss what this phase 3A is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| The way it's self-funded is the money that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| it is funded through the savings that we generate in our utilities from the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=474)|
| 0:08:01| So that's what covers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| So I guess, okay, so if you have to put 19 valves and 29 control points on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=483)|
| 0:08:12| that costs a block of money that we haven't funded yet because we haven't realized the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=492)|
| 0:08:20| You understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| You have to do some things to get the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| So when you say you're funding it on the savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| how are the checks being written based on future benefit, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| And I'm not trying to, I'm just trying to understand the mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| And the funding mechanism on those in the past has been through, well, Trane is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| and we'll let them talk to that in a little more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| My name is Jim McIntire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| I'm the superintendent of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| And we will, O-Innovator is here from Trane and can speak to the specific mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| Basically, you're financing it over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| So you do, there is some mechanism where you have to, where those dollars have to be funded up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| You were correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| We make the investment up front, and then we pay for it over time using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| it can be a couple different funding sources, and I'll let Owen speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| But basically, there's a guarantee as well on the part of Trane that those savings will be realized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| And if we don't realize those savings, that they make up the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| So it's in terms of the level of risk for Knox County Schools, the level of risk for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=569)|
| 0:09:36| it really is quite minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| But I think Mr. Oakes has articulated the basic mechanism, which is you make the improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=578)|
| 0:09:46| and you make them based on the financing of those improvements over time with the savings from utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| But in terms of the specific funding mechanism for Phase 3A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| I think Mr. Innovator will be able to speak more specifically to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| So, yeah, you speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| And then just is this a longer term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| Because I know you probably grabbed all the low-hanging fruit up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| So this Phase 3A is a longer-term payback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| So could you give me an idea of compare the low-hanging fruit Phase 1 stuff to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| where we are now in terms of payback period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Owen Innovator, 6547 Virginia Lee Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| Mr. McKenzie, the phases have been based on school sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| And the initial ten schools, if you will, they kind of nicknamed them the energy hogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| Basically, they picked those schools out as being the worst energy consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| We've since gone through on a site-by-site basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| as opposed to going through all the schools and picking low-hanging fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| And so, for instance, in this phase, this phase of schools includes 27 sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| that have not yet been addressed through the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| And the energy conservation measures range from lighting to plumbing to air conditioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| building automation systems, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| All of the financial terms that we have used to date with the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| and with the county government facilities have been limited to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| And all of the financial pro formas are positive within those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| And some of you will remember the original RFQ that went out from purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| There's an added little benefit to the county and to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| where the reconciliation occurs annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| and consequently TRAIN has written shortfall checks to the school system to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| So, 15 years is the max, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| The 15-year term is max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| That's the financial term of each agreement and appointed by Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| The funding is TRAIN doesn't really have a, you know, we're not in the funding business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| so we work with the county's finance department, the school's finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| to help them put funding in place for the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| The savings that each phase or program produces covers all of the program costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| including cost of debt service, measurement and verification, maintenance services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Any service that's associated with the program is covered by the savings and by the guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| One other point in this particular phase, with the help of Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| we were successful in securing at least a $5 million funding source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| from the state of Tennessee's EESI program, which is at three-quarter percent interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| So, that was a nice treat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Oh, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Owen, did you approach the school system or did the school system approach you all on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| Originally, county purchasing did a very comprehensive RFQ where TRAIN competed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| The schools were the first user within the county for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| And as you recall, you all, this commission body in 2008 also elected to use the program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=794)|
| 0:13:22| It's a great concept, and I compliment you all on doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| So, you're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| I guess I have to give you folks some credit back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| Motion on the floor is to approve, and there has been a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| On page five, item number 26, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| approval of a contract with PSC Metals, Inc., for the sale of recycled scraps and metal collected for recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| at Knox County convenience centers at a rate of $70 less than the American metal market price for the southeast region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| Birmingham, for number one heavy metal still at the time of delivery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| which for June 2011 is $265.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| Attendance is resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| I second, but let me just, why are we discounting at $70?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| I mean, transportation or because it's steel cans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| My name is Tom Salter with Knox County Solid Waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Commissioner, this was a competitive bid, and PSC Metals gave us the best rate, including this discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=869)|
| 0:14:39| Their discount was less than the other company, and that is for transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| This is the price that PSC gets at Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| So when we deliver it to them, they have to process it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| We also give them, we're not, you've been to the centers, it's not pure metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| If it's a set of lawn chairs, there's plastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| If it's a mower, it's got rubber tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| It's got these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| PSC removes these things on behalf of the county with this price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| So they end up delivering pure steel, but we bring them our scrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| And that would primarily be, would that be anything metal, or is that primarily the tin cans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| No, the cans in the, the aluminum cans and steel cans are still part of what we call our monthly spot market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| and the aluminum cans are much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I know, that's over 70 cents, I think, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| What is the steel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| You know, the tuna fish, dog food can, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| I don't have them here today, so I don't know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| But the aluminum is $1,200, $1,400 a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| And that, that doesn't, that can't go out to Grinnell or Maristil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| I know it's up to PSC where they ultimately use it at, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| It's my understanding, well, again, I don't know where PSC takes it, but their price is based on the, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| On the Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| On this monthly, yeah, the Birmingham market price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| I'm sure that's competitive with other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| It would be probably competitive with what the city gets also, wouldn't it, through theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| It would be the same type of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Although the city is only doing, they're not doing scrap steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| They're just doing cans, the two types of cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| And based on what I know, I think they're just, I think they're just dealing with rock tan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Mr. Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| This is going to give us, this may cause us to be the middleman in a scrap and theft issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=998)|
| 0:16:48| Now, when somebody takes metal to PSC, they have to give their name and their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| If they drop it off at a convenience center, they don't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| What are we doing to prevent us from taking in stolen scrap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Well, we don't buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| We don't buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| And actually, our weight of scrap is down slightly because scrap is going back up and people are taking it directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1023)|
| 0:17:11| So, it's just for convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| People who are really in the business of selling scrap, they don't bring it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| We have to run them off, as you know, of our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Tom, this PSC, are they out of Birmingham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| They're here local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| They're local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| They have several local locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| PSC and Tennessee Metals were the two bidders for the scrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| And all I know, all I remember from this is that PSC was the best price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| And this is a year-to-year, it's a five-year, but year-to-year renewing the way the county usually does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| So, just explain this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| What are we doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| It's just for the scrap metal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| We transport the convenience center scrap steel to one of several sites that PSC has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| and they weigh it, and they issue a ticket, and we get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| I think Dwight, at the last meeting, mentioned that we had a good month last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| and we probably did about $90,000 in revenue from scrap steel last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| So, I mean, that depends on how much people bring us and what the price, how the price fluctuates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| When we take it to them, then do they cut us a check for that, or do they pay us cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| They cut us a ticket, and at the end of the month, they write a check that comes to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| I was just going to add to Commissioner Smith's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| That's a national company, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| It's what came off of Phillip Metals, which took a Chapter 11, if not a 7, bankruptcy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| and reemerged as PSC, and it's national.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| And when they ship it to Birmingham, it goes to a foundry down there by rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| It is unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| On Page 6, Item Number 27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Consideration of a Resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| approving a two-year grant agreement in the amount of $757,000 or $378,500 per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| no local match required, with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation for the collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| and recycling of waste tires, Resolution 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Mr. Salter, I'd pull this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| I just wanted to make sure it said no local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| This is just a direct grant from the Department of Energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| No, it's Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| It's a state grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| It's from TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| It is unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Item Number 28,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Consideration of a Resolution of the Commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| approving an agreement between the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| in the amount of $677,190,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| which amount includes the required 20% local match of $135,438 for construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| and TDOT oversight costs relative to the construction of a transportation history museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| as a component to the historic Ramsey House Plantation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| and two, approving a memorandum of understanding between Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| and the Ramsey House Plantation for Ramsey House obligation to fund the entire required 20% local match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| prior to construction Resolution 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| Mr. Rosenberg, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| Can you go through this with the 20% local match and how this is going to work with Ramsey House?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| We simply facilitated Ramsey House's application to TDOT for this enhancement grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| Part of that agreement, however, is that Ramsey House would be responsible for raising the 20% match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| so there will be no county dollars going into this project directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| And the agreement states that they have basically a year from the end of this month to raise the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| and as soon as they raise enough money, we'll proceed with the grant and with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| I sort of want to clarify that there will be no county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| This will all be private fundraising from the Ramsey House board and their supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| Private money, leveraging the state dollars, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Did anyone hear from Ramsey House?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| No, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| I think we miscommunicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Sherry Shuler, who's the new executive director of Ramsey House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| she'll be here on Monday, though, to answer any questions you may have specific to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| I mean, I guess, you know, Monday's the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| I'd like to get a little more time to decipher it prior to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1313)|
| 0:22:05| So in terms of the memorandum of understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1325)|
| 0:22:14| I'm trying to understand why the need for the county to intervene at that 20% rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1334)|
| 0:22:24| Why can't they just hold off construction until they get the 135?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| The county is actually going to receive the grant funds from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| so we're going to be facilitating the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| So the agreement's actually between TDOT and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| However, we're acting on Ramsey House's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| The MOU outlines the responsibility of the Ramsey House to come up with that 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| so that the county isn't responsible for the 20% match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| Are there any, you know, or as far as the once whatever's done, done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| are there any other kind of obligations there with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| Are there any hooks with the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Well, now that because we're receiving these dollars for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| are there any more obligations that the county would incur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| Our office, I mean, no dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Our office, you know, will act as administrator of the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| and will make sure that everything is above board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| and make sure all the costs are eligible costs, and we'll monitor the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| I think there's a five-year period that it has to remain eligible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| but we're confident that all the dollars spent will go towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| and the project will remain eligible for the stipulated period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| But I'm not aware of any additional costs that could come up throughout the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| If there were, obviously we would come back before this body if there were any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1437)|
| 0:24:05| I guess I'm just trying to understand, you know, a little more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| So if you could maybe ask her to send us some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| This is just kind of sprung on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| So if she could send us some recording documentation, what the plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| a layout, what kind of square footage, you know what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| Yeah, I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Actually, I'll have her get in touch with you personally as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| and then send something out to the rest of the board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| I guess I would like to introduce a substitute motion that we just pass it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| I haven't announced the vote yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Is there a second to the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Second to the vote on the substitute that we pass it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Yeah, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| I just had a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| If we pass something even unanimously now and it's on the commission agenda next Monday night, can that be pulled off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1499)|
| 0:25:08| It can be pulled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| And be revoted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| I'm saying that sort of on behalf of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Any commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| I wasn't sure about that, but I just wanted to be certain that we had the opportunity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| I understand, but, you know, with so much on the consent agenda, sometimes something can get lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| and there's a lot of days between now and next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| I just wanted to be sure that even if we did, quote, you know, make a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| or further information came forward between this week and next week, not necessarily on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| but on any issue that we have the opportunity to relook at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| We had some no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| So it will be sent on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| It will be up for discussion next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| On page nine, item number 45, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| requesting that Knox County Audit Committee direct the Knox County Internal Auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| to audit the financial records of the Beck Cultural Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| This is resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Basically, this is something we have talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| This would be sent to the Audit Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| and the Audit Committee would take it over and oversee it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| and make any recommendations as to how that would proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| We're just basically sending it to the Audit Committee asking that this audit be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| We are on 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| So as I stated last week, in reading your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| And I'd ask this maybe for a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| With there being such an interconnection between public and private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| and there's nothing disparaging about our internal auditor at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| but I think it would be a cleaner process if we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| and it shouldn't take a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| It shouldn't take a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| I mean, this is pretty basic stuff here, as you outlined it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| I'd like to have – ask you to consider a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| that we have an outside auditor look at these funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| because, again, I think it's – and, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| when was the last check that the county submitted to a vendor on behalf of Beck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| It was in 2011, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| So, I mean, it's just – in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| it would be cleaner to look at the whole scope of what the county did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| what Beck did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| And I'd ask you to consider that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| I'd be happy to say that we're asking that the Knox County Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| audit the financial records and take out the internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| let them decide what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| But, yeah, I have no problem with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| And then I guess my second question, I guess, for general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| and this is maybe for doing some wordsmithing as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| is, you know, I'd like for this to be considered maybe a process that we start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| not just end with the Beck numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| I mean, we have, as you say so eloquently in your resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| we've been entrusted to administer and maintain these taxpayer funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| If we could somehow put some words and say that this is maybe the first audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| that we're asking the audit committee to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Yes, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| I'm kind of in agreement here that I don't know if we're uncharted waters or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1722)|
| 0:28:54| Let me look at the second point first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| People that are granted these community grants from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| are responsible for going through some kind of process right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| in that you don't just get money, you've got to do something up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| You get money and then you have to prove something at the tail end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| So I think there's already an audit trail in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| We're not inventing the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| We already have something in place for the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| And then I want to back up then to the first question about doing this to Beck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| and I view it as doing it to Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| They exist in a certain manner as approved in the current budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| and I believe they satisfied all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| I don't know whether we need to have the county auditor out at Beck or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| I don't know that we need to hire an outside auditor to go to Beck or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| I don't follow the need for something to be done, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| It's going to cost us, Knox County, money to go do when there's a process in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| and this one center is reacting to the county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| just like four or five other centers are acting to county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| So what I think is that either I think that this needs to go away for Beck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| and if there is something that needs to be done for all these other people to get $12,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| well, let's bring that back and not have names at the top of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| We just need to bring it back and say we'd like to see the executive of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| look at the people that are receiving community grants, look at them all in the same fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| So unless I can get someone to really support why we need to do this audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| I'll probably be voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| You know, Commissioner Wright, if you wanted, I don't disagree with you at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| if you wanted to introduce it as a substitute motion, I'd support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| Well, I don't know what my substitute motion would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| because there is something here before us that we're either going to approve or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| And I'm of the opinion just to be up front and say I would deny performing this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1883)|
| 0:31:32| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| We have an audit department who is familiar with the operational ways of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1897)|
| 0:31:46| If and when the necessity arises that we need to have an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| that's the person that needs to be doing the audit because they've got two steps ahead going into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| They know what they're looking for and they know how to find it, get in and get out quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| That's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| And as far as whether we need one here, you know, there's been a lot of accusations made in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| It depends on who feels like one needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| But at this point right now, I would agree with Commissioner Wright that unless we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| have a better understanding that one is needed, then I say we let sleeping dogs lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1941)|
| 0:32:31| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| I support an audit of the Beck Center just because of the last six weeks of debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1954)|
| 0:32:42| and the questions that have arisen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| I think it would be healthy for all of us and for the Beck Center itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| I'm groping with if we need to bring someone independent of the Knox County, of Richard Laws' group in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1972)|
| 0:33:02| I don't think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| And I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| But my position, and I doubt I will change from it, will Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| when this is reviewed by the Audit Committee on July the 6th, will be to let our internal audit handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| And another reason is whether it would be an added expense, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| And Hugh's out here, Hugh Holt, his department would be, we've been through several of these RFPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| and it adds many weeks, if not months, to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| We have to, I believe that would have to be an RFP, wouldn't it, Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| Mike Reeves usually handles that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| But it's an arduous process and there's maybe two or three people that bid or maybe ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| You never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| And then you review them and we get these thick books and it just creates a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| I'm not complaining about the process or the ordeal, but it creates a lot of, it demands a lot more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2034)|
| 0:34:04| And it would be months, I would speculate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| instead of a few weeks that Richard and his group could get out there and perform the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| So I think our internal people could handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| If I could, Mr. Chairman, just on that subject, and I'll defer back to the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| but the reason the resolution calls for the internal auditor to do these is because your code tasks the internal auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| with this duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| It's specifically in your code of ordinances that the internal auditor is responsible for auditing any entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| public or private, that receives county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Richard, how long would that take if you did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| I'm not going to hold you to it, but on the surface, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| I'd probably say with planning and just getting started, probably about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| Like a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| I had a question really on what is the status and what are the plans for the status of the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2101)|
| 0:35:09| There was this original memorandum that they would be incorporated into the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| their organization would be turned over to the county, whether it's in the library system or in some other fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| And, you know, first of all, the question is where does that stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| And then the second comment I have is if they are indeed going to become part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2126)|
| 0:35:34| it would be appropriate for us to perform an audit by the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| If they're not, that may or may not be another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| I'm not in favor of going to an outside source, you know, an RFP for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| It seems like that's an unnecessary expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| And there doesn't seem to be an inherent conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| We probably should reserve those just for when there appears to be, you know, a conflict of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| and we've had some of those or some accusations of those before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| But I guess my question is, you know, what are the intentions of the Beck Center now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| and is this process that we've talked about of them becoming part of the county as a county facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| is that still in the works or where does that stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| I see Mr. Rice coming to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| Name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| Commissioner, I cannot speak to any future plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| There is no plan being contemplated at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| There's been very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| The Beck Center's attorney, Mr. Cohen, spoke to me at one point prior to the budget vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| regarding the MOU in his sense that his view that it was still in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| made very clear that the mayor of the administration feels that that was terminated on August 15, 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| and then later executed the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| So there's no agreement at this time and there's no discussion of that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| So really they're just another non-profit like so many other non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2227)|
| 0:37:19| I want to get to Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Let me address a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| First of all, I have no problem, I have a lot of confidence in our audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| I have no problem going to them and saying, you all decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| If you think that Mr. Walls can do the, or the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| if they feel that Mr. Walls can do the job, I have no issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| If they feel for whatever reason that they need to maybe take another direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| then I have no issue with that either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| but I would like to put it in the hands of the audit committee and let them make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| My sense is that Mr. Walls can do the audit and if it's going to only take a month to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| then I don't have any issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| But if they feel that there is a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| and perhaps it needs to be in another direction, then they can decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| So I have no issue at all with letting the audit committee make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| because I think they'll make the proper decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Secondly, should an audit of BEC be conducted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| My view, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Too many questions have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Too many things have come up with the issue of the funds at BEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Even Mr. Cohen, their attorney, appeared before us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| we have no problem with an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| So if BEC has no problem, I think that we need to do it to clear the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| with the community, with BEC, with us, with the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| Let's go ahead and do it and do it as quickly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| and as efficiently as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| And once the audit comes back, then I think we can sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| and take a look at where they have requested that they come back under Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| But I think that before we can have those discussions, I think this audit is vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| And so I will be voting in favor of asking the audit committee to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| and move on with that and have them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| I'll send Commissioner McKenzie first, then I'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| I agree with everything that you said there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| And my whole point was, as the resolution read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| it instructed the audit committee to use the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| That's why I agree with taking those words out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| It's up to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| The folks who sit on that audit committee will make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| I just did not want to be too prescriptive in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| And I also agree with the fact that, and maybe this is a question for the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2370)|
| 0:39:40| I don't know what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| It sounds like the mayor doesn't have any intention on this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| in engaging in that conversation about coming back in into the fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2387)|
| 0:39:57| And it sounds like Beck has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| I don't know whether they publicly have made some voice about wanting to come back into the fold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2399)|
| 0:40:09| or not feeling that they ever left the fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| What's the next step on that, if there is a next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| If there's not, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| But in terms of whether those conversations will continue or not, I guess I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| Do we have any say in that, or do we just let it marinate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| Well, at this juncture, Commissioner, I mean, there's no agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| So in terms of reinitiating a new agreement, it would be depending upon the terms and conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| If we're going to start actually transferring county funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| and bringing an outside entity into the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| that's something the commission needs to be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| But, again, just to go back, again, I realize that I purposely put the language in that resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| deferring to the internal auditor because that's the way your code currently reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| Your code does say that this is a duty of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| So if anybody's going to audit Beck, according to your code, second 282,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| that is the duty of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| It is not a duty of an outside auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| And I think there was a reason that was put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| because you're dealing with entities that receive county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| And my second question is, what are we auditing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| We're auditing the, you know, a lot of the outcry that came out came because they had a fairly, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2490)|
| 0:41:38| I'd say a piddly sum if you're trying to build an endowment that's lasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| They had what some people would consider a significant sum of money in terms of their endowment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| their bank account or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| This, and this is maybe a question for the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| is we're talking about auditing the county funds, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| And that's all we're talking about, auditing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| Well, again, I was asked to draft a resolution calling for an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| But generally you're going to audit the manner in which an entity handles those funds provided to it by a public entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2531)|
| 0:42:19| So, in other words, normally an audit of this nature is restricted to the transfer and use of county monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2539)|
| 0:42:28| If you're going to start going beyond that and start getting into their private investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| or things that are unrelated to the county, I think that would be a little too attenuated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Would it be appropriate or proper to put that verbiage into this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| Would it be unacceptable, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| No, it wouldn't be unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| I mean, I think generally the whole idea behind this code section is to ensure public monies are not being misused or squandered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2566)|
| 0:42:55| Beyond that, you know, for instance, if they get money from another entity and make a purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| that's outside of the purview of your audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| I would just like some words in that process because, you know, again, a lot of the outcry was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| wow, they've got a lot of money in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| How do they get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| And I don't want this thing to splinter and take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| I'm not saying that, Richard, I'm not saying that you would, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| But I think there would be some people in the public, this outcry, that would want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| So I guess if the commission wouldn't mind, I would like to have some words in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| to say that we're auditing the public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| I think that we have to audit what we can legally audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| I mean, I don't know that we can legally audit anything other than the funds that we've given, can we, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| Well, I mean, this is a pretty broad section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| but it essentially defers to the internal auditor to determine what principles and procedures he's going to invoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2629)|
| 0:43:57| But, you know, again, generally you don't go beyond public funds unless you can show some kind of nexus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2637)|
| 0:44:04| So, in other words, if they were given a hundred, let's just say in round conceptualization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| you give an entity $100,000 for building improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| You do an audit and you find out that $60,000 was used for that, $40,000 is elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| You're going to have to try to track down where that money went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| But the whole idea of an audit is to make sure county funds aren't being squandered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| I just want to point out, this has been pointed out a couple of times since I put my light on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| the fact that, as the Law Director did mention earlier, our code says it's to be done by the internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| and I would agree that that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| On second thought, I said earlier that maybe we didn't need to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| but based on everything that's happened, I'm having second thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| Based on all of the conversations and all over the last six weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| I think we need to do this to clear the air for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| And as far as how deep it can go, I think it needs to go as deep as it can go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| because if I've got money in one hand and I've got money in the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| and you want to look at the money that I spend out of this hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| what I spend out of this hand over here dictates how that I may be using this over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| I know that sounds kind of far reaching, but we've got to look at principles and modes of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| So I would say go forward with the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| And Commissioner Brown, sort of I thought he was getting on to where I was going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| when he started using this hand and that hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| And what I would say, and this is not a disparaging remark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| and I don't take it in that vein, but I like to watch jugglers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| I've been to several classes from whenever I was with AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| One of those team-building things was to teach you how to do things that you couldn't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| and I never did learn how to juggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| But the impressive thing about it is that a person can juggle and it takes two hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| It's when one of those hands might be out of sight that I don't know what's taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| and I see that if we're talking about Beck, and that's all that's before us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| it's either we look at everything or we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| And I want to go back to my original statement is that I cannot view a reason for what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| if they're considered like the other five or six organizations that have applied for community funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2797)|
| 0:46:46| They did it with a really in-depth set of paperwork, I hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| and they're going to comply with where did the money go on an ongoing basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| The thing that I didn't say earlier was the fact that I don't want to see Knox County interject itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| into standing between the Beck Center and whoever looks at it from a regulatory point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2825)|
| 0:47:14| It might be all right that Knox County go and audit them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| but I don't want to get Knox County dollars involved in going and checking on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| that needs to be standing on its own and filing its own paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| It's obvious that I've seen three or four different sets of paperwork about what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| That's between Beck and whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| If we, Knox County, get involved in it, we may clear the air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| but we may not know all the things that are taking place when we get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| But we are the ones that have interjected ourselves into this quest for whatever it is that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2867)|
| 0:47:55| If we come out wrong, which we can do, I mean, it's been illustrated by Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| They have been able to refile or file and refile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| I just don't think we ought to be there facing the circumstances that are before us right now today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| And then a moment ago, we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| It's to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| Is it amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| Yes, I accept that the amendment is to let the Audit Committee determine how the audit should proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| Moving us along today because I think everyone needs to go and think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| and we're not going to approve it or disapprove it today anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| I would like to see the amendment be that it be forwarded to the full commission without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| so we might move on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| That is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Is that a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| It's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| Do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Yes, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| You know, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| I might actually direct this to Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| When those are, you know, our grant funds that go to these different nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| very few of those have strings attached or say they're specifically for a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| And I suspect that when it goes there, it gets co-mingled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| And I don't know how you could do an audit by determining where the 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| or the $150,000 that we've sent or the $300,000 we've sent in previous years is spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| without looking at how everything is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Now, I mean, I think it's different if you take the case, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| like Mr. Jarrett talked about where we're giving a specific grant for a specific construction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| That would be pretty easy to look to see where the money went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| But not on these general grants because I'm sure they just go into the general account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| They don't have a separate account that they write checks off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| Am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| I don't know how you can do an audit unless you're doing an audit of the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| Yeah, there's normally co-mingled funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Co-mingling, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| The only time you can really restrict it again is if you gave them a designated money for a designated purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| But, you know, the possibility of looking beyond that money, if they're co-mingled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| it's going to open it up much wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| So, really, you're going to have to look at the whole thing to get a picture as to what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| I don't know how you could just see how county money is spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| because I don't think there's any way of determining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| It would all depend on how they accounted for it, whether it was a separate bank account or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| whether it was co-mingled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| And we would approach it just like any other audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| We would, you know, get general direction from you guys and the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| do a preliminary review, then do a risk assessment to define the procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| and, you know, how we would go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| And I had one final, you know, I have a feeling it's not in a separate bank account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| It seems like that would really be a lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| It is. It actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Well, then that would be, it would be very easy just to figure out where $150,000 was spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| You just see where the checks were written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| So that would be easy then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| My other question was, and this will help me to determine whether I need to vote for or against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| was there a question or did I read in the paper where at some point as we're getting into the new fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| that we were going to re-look at if there were more funds turned back to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| the excess funds from some of the other departments, and then re-look at BEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| or is the BEC issue dead as far as additional funding until next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| I think we mentioned something about that maybe at looking at salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| Where do we leave this with the BEC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| It's over and done until FY13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| I think the way I read it, it's over and done until FY13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| The audit, I mean, my view is that the audit needs to take place before any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| I mean, they've asked to come back under Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| I mean, there's these discussions out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| I think we have to do an audit first and we have to see where we are before we know where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| That's just my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| And grant, I have a, maybe you can clarify this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| In talking about in terms of what groups that get community grant money have to provide certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3144)|
| 0:52:33| and then they have to continue to give quarterly reports, but BEC was not part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| they weren't reviewed by the Citizen Review Panel, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| They were in a different group than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| So in terms of community grant programs, Dave, I think they're not part of that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3165)|
| 0:52:53| They were handled differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| So they don't have all of those things that they had to present like the other community grant recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3175)|
| 0:53:04| So I don't know actually what they did, what they have provided for up front before any of this was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3184)|
| 0:53:13| I am curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| I know that there's been a lot of, that was the only question I had for you, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| There's been a lot of confusion and a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| I think that an audit would be a very beneficial thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| I would think that BEC would welcome that, the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| And as far as why they should be treated differently than any of these other groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3212)|
| 0:53:39| I think it's because they are a little different in terms of the, not so much the services that they provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3219)|
| 0:53:49| but the things that they have on hand there and the role that they have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| And, in fact, I want to mention something that Mike Hammond said at a Sunshine breakfast meeting recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3235)|
| 0:54:07| when we were discussing BEC, a statement that he made that I feel incredibly proud that he made it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3247)|
| 0:54:16| that the BEC is not just about African-American history, it's about our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| And if you're a white male, it's a very uncomfortable history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| And I think that was a very, I was very proud of Commissioner Hammond when he made that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3266)|
| 0:54:34| And I think that is a really good indicator of why BEC is so important to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| and why we need to be continuing a dialogue with them and seeing what we can do to make sure that that history is preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3281)|
| 0:54:50| They have a lot of artifacts there, I think, that are important to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| And I think that we need to keep a relationship going in this dialogue open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| and see what we can do to preserve what is our own, all of our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| I guess I am, for the record, again, I am in favor of the county auditing the funds that the county spent for operational BEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3313)|
| 0:55:31| Or you can audit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| It went through procurement, but you can audit the funds that the county spent on the construction of BEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| In fact, if they did that, the county probably would owe BEC a $70,000 check because they actually came in under budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3339)|
| 0:55:49| but there were some additional items that should have been completed and all that other good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| So I am in favor of conducting whatever type of audit of the public funds that you would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3353)|
| 0:56:04| I do, however, have a problem with a general audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| And the overtones are deafening, undertones or muted statements, I think, are deafening in terms of there is this perception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3370)|
| 0:56:23| that there is something out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| And I don't think this will ever go away as long as we keep this process of throwing hints out there that aren't really substantiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3386)|
| 0:56:41| but they're enough to keep the folks doing whatever they do in terms of somehow there's something been done wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3401)|
| 0:56:55| BEC's been around since 1975.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| They've been raising money in some shape, form or fashion since 1975.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| Would you have us go back that far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| This is unprecedented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| Call for an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| And, again, I don't mind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| I think it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| I think it's needed to vindicate the BEC Cultural Exchange Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| They need to get on with raising money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| And here we're still kind of making these statements about, you know, we need to do it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| Let's go after it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Let's put this to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| We voted to cut BEC's budget by 92%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| Again, I smell dead horse here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| We beat this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| We beat it and beat it and beat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| I don't know what folks want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| What else do we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Do we want to make sure that the taxpayer dollars were spent how they were intended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| Let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| But let's not start, again, a witch hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| You know, you've got hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| We're going out to both hands now because we've got to figure out that they spent money in 1975| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| and it could get to that point if we let it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| We need to let those folks figure out what they're going to do to survive and stop this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3504)|
| 0:58:36| I am fine with leaving the resolution as is, the commissioner rights substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3516)|
| 0:58:47| doing whatever the audit committee want, but having the audit committee, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| in the resolution say we'll have the internal auditor use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| I have every confidence that Mr. Walls would do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| The only thing I was just worried about, Mr. Walls is dealing with colleagues and dealing with the private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| That was my whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| I mean, he has a relationship with our finance department, our procurement department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| I just wanted something autonomous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| We can't do that or don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Please don't leave here saying Sam is somehow wanting something swept under the rug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| No, he is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| But what he is extremely adamant about is let's get on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3564)|
| 0:59:34| If we start auditing everything, it will be a long, long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| Mr. Rollins told me that they opened up a separate account to take in this $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3580)|
| 0:59:47| that those funds were expended out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| This should not be a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| I have every confidence that we'll get it back in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| We'll receive the report, and folks will stop talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| But if we audit everything that we've ever done and everything that they've ever done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| we're going to be here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| They're going to have a hard time starting a capital campaign process, which is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| That's what we've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| So let's, again, let them lick their wounds, but let them move on and move out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| and try to make Beck Culture Exchange Center something that's going to be viable deep, deep into the next century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3630)|
| 1:00:40| John Tory may ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| And the motion on the floor is to send it on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| We'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| But I have a question, Mr. Tory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| How much money have we given the Beck Cultural Center in the last three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| And do you know how much we've given maybe in the last five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| I'm talking about Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| I have to remember the pieces because there was a year for operations that was $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| There was a year that was $175,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| And a year that was $150,000 for operational funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| And that was outside of the capital contribution for the project, the most recent project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3672)|
| 1:01:19| But we can give you a full report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| I was just trying to get an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| So we're talking about at least $375,000 if we go back three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| So if we did a three-year to a five-year audit, you know, it doesn't make sense to go back to me any further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| But my whole point is, as Mr. Cohen appeared before us, he said, they have no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| Questions have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| The news media has asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| We've asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| I think the audit is vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| I think we need to clear the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| And whether we move forward with Beck as a government entity and whether we reach any agreements, that's for further discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| But I think that this question needs to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| We can answer it very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| We can do it within a month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| I just think we have to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| And so, but the motion on the floor is to send on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| I'll vote no as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| So, how many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| Four no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Well, let's make that five no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| Let's do a roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| Yeah, let's do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| That way we get it recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| This is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| This is to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| Without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3751)|

| 1:03:27| We will send it off without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Item number 46, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3811)|
| 1:03:39| authorizing Knox County to enter into a short-term contract with no less than 30 days or no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| more than 60 days with Natural Resources Recovery of Tennessee, LLC for the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| of the Solway Greenway Facility and the Forks of the River Convenience Center until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| sale and transfer of the Solway Greenway Facility to a new owner are completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| This is Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3840)|
| 1:04:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| We have two people who have signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| Mr. Joe Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3846)|
| 1:04:16| Mr. Denton, your name and address for the record, please, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Joe Denton, 11780 Couchmo Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| My brothers and I own Knox Auto Parts over on Oak Ridge Highway, and we just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| express our interest in possibly purchasing this piece of land, but we would respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3867)|
| 1:04:34| like to request that it be zoned industrial instead of agricultural, which is what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| would need, and it's probably more consistent with even its current use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| We started our business in 1995 with just the three of us, and we currently employ 38| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| We kind of need to expand, and this facility would make a great piece of property to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| onto, but we would need it zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| Being able to expand, we would be able to hire more people and create more jobs, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| I just wanted to make that known to the Commission and just express my interest and point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3908)|
| 1:05:15| view on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Mr. Law Director, as far as the zoning, would that have to go before MPC and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| So, the Metropolitan Planning Commission would be your first step, I mean, in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| as you're looking at it as far as any type of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| You have to buy it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Yeah, you have to buy it first, and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Well, I was just, in other words, I know it was up for consideration as to whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| zoning would be left agricultural or changed to something more like industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| I think it would be advantageous to the county to go ahead and change it to industrial before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| It would make the property worth more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| I know it would cost me more money if I was bidding at the auction for it, but it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| be hard to buy something without knowing whether or not you're going to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| do what you need to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| The Commission can't commit to that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| It would have to go through the standard zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| We'd only be speculating, and it can't make any legal assertions to you as to the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| Earlier in the last week or so, there was something came through that maybe MPC recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| that it stay agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Buzz, can you talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| That was from Purchasing and Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Oh, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| I believe so, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| Buzz, have you all taken a look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| Have you all taken a look at this piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| No, that was from Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Mr. Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| I know what you own on the south side of Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4005)|
| 1:06:59| Do you own the north side of Oak Ridge Highway also, where the cars are stacked up the hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| It's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| No, definitely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| There's two salvage yards there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| In other words, our water recycling is Knox Auto Parts, and then there's another one next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| That's not us either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| Across the street is not you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Let me tell you a little bit about what I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| And if anybody out there knows something different, they can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| You know, I had actually proposed a resolution where we looked at either having some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| commercial realtors or the development corporation or someone look at rezoning the land, perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4055)|
| 1:07:43| even breaking it into parcels where part of it could be rezoned one way, part of it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| be rezoned another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| And I believe as they looked at that, the information that I got, and I think I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| with Todd Napier and I don't know if Hugh, was it Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Hugh and maybe someone from engineering, Dwight Vanderbate also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| And they felt that that was not going to be practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| The other problem with trying to change the zoning on it to suit a potential buyer is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| there may be other buyers who want a different zoning on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| And it's just hard to do to say, let's change it to industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| It may very well be worth more that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| But if somebody else wants to buy the property for a different use, then that puts a barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| And, you know, it's just awful hard to try to suit, I think, to try to suit everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| The intention was exactly what you're proposing when I brought that resolution forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| But I believe that the development corporation and the purchasing department and the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| department looked at it and thought that that really wouldn't be too practical to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| break this down, then rezone all the different parcels, trying to guess what somebody would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| And I'm putting that out there more for information, and I believe that's accurate, what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| Is that what's before us, this 53?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| Actually, you know, my intention was to withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4153)|
| 1:09:20| We can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Really, this is what we're talking, I mean, this is really 53 that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| right now in actuality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| And also, I think it would be, I mean, we're talking about a very, very long process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| break that into parcels, rezone each parcel, and then have an auction for all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| And I think they even discussed that with the auction company in whose interest it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4179)|
| 1:09:43| be to get the maximum amount out of this because they're going to get paid on a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| basis, I suspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| And Hugh Holt's shaking his head yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| And I think they felt that probably selling this as one large parcel zoned the way it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| is now, which is agricultural, would probably be best rather than, like I said, rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| trying to rezone to different buyers that may have different interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| And that's, anyway, that's the information that I got from purchasing engineering in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Any other comments, sir, you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| No, I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| Also, Brad Mays, your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| I think it's important for this commission to keep in mind, you all were given some inaccurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| information a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| The case that I filed against NRR regarding their revenue sharing and the Matthews grinding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| double billing was found to have merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| The Solid Waste Department had launched their own investigation and found that there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| no merit under the supervision of Bruce Weitrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| When that went in front of the court, the court was displeased with this, ordered an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| investigation into the engineering department, and Bruce Weitrick was subsequently fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| The case is still alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| The court ruled that I did have merit in that case against Natural Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| Now, since that time, you have had an audit done and you've seen a series, a pattern of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| repeatedly the county making mistakes to the benefit of Natural Resources recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| And some would argue it's just a more charitable argument would be that it was an honest mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| that we overpaid them or failed to collect hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| Now, keep in mind, we were only able to audit some of the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| Not all of them still existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| But from what we could document, you all were looking at a half million dollars or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| And the county has said they want to be out of the mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| If you want out of the mulch business, why would you extend the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4321)|
| 1:12:08| Knox County put their green waste contract out for bid this past March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| The successful bidder was not Natural Resources Recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| It was this company called The Mulch Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| They're located on Everett Road here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| After they won the bid, I don't know if it was Solid Waste or whomever decided they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| not want to award them their contract, and now they're wanting to extend the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| with the current vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| And I don't know if this is legal to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| There's no provision for an extension in their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| It's a contract in excess of $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| I don't believe we can extend this contract without putting it out for bid, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| after considering we've already done it, had a successful bidder and refused to give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| In addition to that, I'd like to reiterate that the original investigation by the Solid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| Waste Department that said that my claims of contaminated mulch were unfounded turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| out not to be the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| As your Solid Waste Director is well aware, he personally tested the mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| He found multiple products that were highly contaminated with fecal coliform, salmonella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| E. coli, you name it, they had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| In their mulch, it was sold to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| Is this how you want to report that type of activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| And this commission was not given the whole story about that back then, and I think many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| commissioners regretted their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| And in lieu of reading this recent audit, the Pam Brees report, the Judge Weaver ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| I think that this is one of those situations that commission has a chance to redo something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| and do it right this time, and we can correct this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| If we want out of the mulch business, the way to cure that is not extending a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| with the same vendor who has this track history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Mr. Riggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| I see Hugh Holtz back there, because I've, Brad, I've already talked to some of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| here about this contract in the bid that was supposedly won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| Hugh, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Yes, we bid those services out, and Hugh Holt, 1000 North Central, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| We bid those services out, and once we went through the complete evaluation process and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| did all of our due diligence, it was determined that, actually, this contract, if we moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| to another vendor, it would cost us money, or we would lose revenues over what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| currently making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| And at that point, the administration wasn't sure in which direction we were going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| so we canceled that bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| There was never an award of a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| And I have one other question, and I'm not sure whether this is a legal question or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| but it's also what Brad brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| If we are extending a contract, and it's, well, how much is the contract, what do we get per month from NRR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4494)|
| 1:15:02| Six thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| It is the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| I think the last three quarters, I think we've brought in over 30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| And if we are, if we have a contract that expires on July 31st, you know, with a given company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4508)|
| 1:15:16| do we have to put that back out, or can we just arbitrarily, I mean, I'm talking about the legality of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| but what if there is an issue, you know, of a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| Can we just arbitrarily extend it without putting this thing back out to bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4525)|
| 1:15:32| I would defer to our law director on that, but from a procurement standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| it would have to be done under an emergency basis to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| You can't have an emergency contract to serve as an interim until you get to where you need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4544)|
| 1:15:58| Do you have anything else, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| No, I don't know if this is anything we need to, you know, to research anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4559)|
| 1:16:05| You know, I was, I'll be honest, I was initially in favor of doing what would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| in the financially best interest of the county rather than having something sitting there doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4569)|
| 1:16:19| not bringing us any revenue if we could get another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| When do we anticipate the auction to take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| I know that the RFP is out or about to go out, whatever you call it, for the auction to take place, or the notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| Yeah, July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| The auction will be on July the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Yes, that's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| And is that considered, when did the notices actually go out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4597)|
| 1:16:42| They should start their marketing campaign the end of this week, first of next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4602)|
| 1:16:49| We wanted to wait until the commission had got these two issues that were on the agenda cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4609)|
| 1:16:57| And, again, as far as the county being able to maximize the amount of revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4617)|
| 1:17:06| that we would get from the sale of this property, is two weeks or three weeks a long enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| for a potential bidder to line up his financing on something like this, or do we need to postpone that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4634)|
| 1:17:23| That may be more of a business and a finance question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| But I know sometimes for loans it's tough to get your letter from the bank on a fairly short notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4647)|
| 1:17:36| Thirty days is short, but it can be done for bidders that have good credit ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4656)|
| 1:17:45| But is that too short a period of time for them to have a letter of credit saying that if they buy the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| at auction on this date that they'll have their financing in order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| And are we going to maximize the county's return by having it so soon after the announcement date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| Well, I will say that we have, or I've been told by the auctioneering company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| that we have three viable purchasers right now for that property who are showing a strong interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| that apparently has the resources and are ready to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| I would defer to John as far as the finance question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| but that would be a possibility depending on your financial situation currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| And the only other question I have, and if we need a week to research this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| by extending the contract we're calling this an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4715)|
| 1:18:41| Is this, is there, and I'm not trying to be facetious here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| but is there such a thing as a mulch emergency or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| No, but when you contract outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| Is that something that we have to determine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| It would be something that would have a financial impact on the county or on the citizens of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4734)|
| 1:19:04| put the citizens of the county in danger in some form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| There is a definition by code of what an emergency contract is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| You know, I would like just to make a substitute motion that we also defer this to a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| because I think there's been, you know, some information out there that we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| you know, we may need to consider, you know, about the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| We do have the information out there that there was not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| we do have this available to us now that there was not a contract awarded back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| And that's, I'd like to make a substitute motion, because this is fairly controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| This has been, for those of us that sat through all these negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| rather than just voting on this right now, we might need another week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| It's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| It's in front of the public right now to see what else comes out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| So your motion is to send it on without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Just to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| Motion to make a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| Commissioner Willenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4802)|
| 1:20:11| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| Brad, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| I think you misunderstood about the no merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| I didn't say that the court didn't find it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| This has not got anything to do with the topic of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| This is a personal matter, and I don't think it needs to be discussed in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| Actually, I was misunderstood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| and I want to make sure for the public that the correct information is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| What I said was that the county law department decided that it didn't have merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| But I've received several e-mails that someone thought I said something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| So I just wanted to make sure that I had the proper information out there for the people who misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| I won't waste any time responding, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| I'm a little bit concerned about this successful bidder that we had in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| and we didn't go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| What's the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| It's almost like we're making sure that somebody else gets this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| Commissioner, let me answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| My name is Tom Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| I'm the Solid Waste Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| We made a decision after Dwight came that we would not re-bid the contract in the same form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4887)|
| 1:21:34| We would not bid for an operator to come in and basically have full control of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| grind the wood, sell material to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| We made a decision when the new mayor came in that we were not going to do any retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| Then we decided we weren't going to do any of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| We didn't want to compete with any mulch yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| So we looked at a model where the county would have minimal staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| The county would actually staff the scale house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| The county would have a loader operator, and we would bid out grinding on a periodic basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4925)|
| 1:22:13| When we ran those numbers, when we got the numbers back from the bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| and we looked at our costs for operation with staffing the scale house, buying a loader, staffing the loader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4937)|
| 1:22:24| and then trying to predict the inbound material and our cost for grinding versus our revenue for tipping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4944)|
| 1:22:33| it was too risky for us to recommend to the finance department and to the mayor that we use that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4953)|
| 1:22:42| So we rejected those bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| We opted not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| Those bids were actually part of a self-operation model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| They weren't a model like we have now at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| So the decision was made not to self-operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| There wasn't a decision to not award grinding to someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| We just made a decision not to self-operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| And after we made that decision, the only logical thing was to then we decided we did not need to be doing recycling of wood, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4983)|
| 1:23:13| And that's where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| And one last comment, Mr. Chairman, is I agree 100% with Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| If you have bought any commercial property lately, I mean, the rules have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| And for us to give people two weeks, say, all right, we've got this for sale, we're going to give people two weeks to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| Guys, we're a short change in the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| We've got a valuable piece of property out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| And the more time that people take to look at it, right now we've got three people looking at it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5015)|
| 1:23:42| in two weeks to let a couple of people, that's just not fair to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| We need to get the best use out of that property, the highest dollar that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| And if we only open it up for two weeks, you know, that's defeating the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| It's like we're trying to do something for somebody out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| Mr. Rice, name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| I just wanted to clarify for the record from some comments that were made previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| Mr. Bruce Weitrick was not fired by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| Mr. King, name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| I'm not going to talk about things that occurred in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| I'm not going to talk about a lawsuit that's going on and everybody's got their positions staked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| and everybody's arguing vigorously in support of their particular position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| But I did want to make a comment about some of the things that were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| So I can maybe be even more simple and direct to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| What they had back in March was actually a request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| And all of those requests for proposals contained the legend that the county has got the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| if it wants to, not to award a contract to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| And it's not in the strictest sense of the word, albeit it's a request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| And what it did was submit to me what you can do for us with regard to this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| And when they got it back to take care of the green waste, what they determined, I believe I can correctly say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| was it costs too dang much money and we're not interested in doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| So they didn't award the contract to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Made the decision to sell this property and move forward in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5118)|
| 1:25:26| As far as the looking at the property, Commissioner Briggs, there is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5126)|
| 1:25:33| it's pretty well known already by virtue of this and other things that have gone on that that property is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| There have been a number of people express interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| I know that there was a group of people there as late as Friday looking at the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| and taking a look at it and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| One of the things that has sort of been driving, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| this was the interest of the county in getting that property sold as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5153)|
| 1:26:00| but yet preserving the time so that this commission had the opportunity to look at the issue of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| is it something you want to do to parcel it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| Is there something out there that maybe you might want to rezone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| And the idea was always let's give enough time to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| but at the same time let's try to move forward as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| Our position on behalf of the current contractor on that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| and currently doing business with the county, our position was and remains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| we don't mind you taking that due diligence so long as we got, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| the opportunity to continue that operation there until such time as the property is sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| Does it operate to the benefit of my client?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| Does it operate to the benefit of the citizens of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| They can continue to put their product there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| This county can continue to receive funds, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| And I think that's what we all ought to sort of try to concentrate on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| as the county moves forward in getting rid of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| There was one other thing I was wanting to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| Now I've sort of forgotten what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| You won't probably appreciate the fact I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| But I think it is the correct thing to say that the proper people have looked at the issue of rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5234)|
| 1:27:28| and the issue of parceling and made the decision that that's not viable or doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| I could talk to you about that possibility of rezoning and suggest it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| but I don't think I need to at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| I don't believe that's the appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| On the contract, arguably, and Mr. Jarrett is probably more informed on this than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5263)|
| 1:27:52| but certainly you can enter into a contract on a limited term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5272)|
| 1:28:03| You couldn't have a 30-day contract with an entity for every 30 days for a year or two years or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5283)|
| 1:28:14| But you can certainly enter into a short-term contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| And they talk about it, you know, like an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| That just means you're under constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| You need to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Arguably, if it's a 30-day contract and it's not more than $10,000, this body wouldn't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5305)|
| 1:28:34| if it's not over $10,000, this body wouldn't necessarily have the obligation to even vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| I think, in fairness to the people involved, they knew of the interest of county commission in this subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| and they know that it is likely that we're going to have a second additional 30-day contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| that they thought was probably appropriate that this body deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| The last three months, the amount has been averaging about $10,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| but we've had some unusual weather activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| But you do get a minimum each month of $6,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| And so I think that was just the points I wanted to make on those issues that you all have discussed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| We, of course, on our behalf and I think based on my involvement in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| the people who represent purchasing, the mayor's office and others would urge that you go forward on next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5364)|
| 1:29:35| and vote to approve this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| Otherwise, what happens is there are no tomorrows after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| If the contract does not get approved, then you're going to, in essence, lose the current person on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| no matter when the property gets sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| And you're going to lose them at the end of July when otherwise you would still have them there paying the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5394)|
| 1:30:04| I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| I just really think that we would be doing the public harm if we shutter up this facility while this process goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5412)|
| 1:30:25| I do think that, you know, with this weekend's weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| they'll probably get another good month based on what's going to be happening today and tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| as folks haul their stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| And there's no telling what the future holds as far as weather activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| I think this is a resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| Well, I guess in terms of the product, let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5444)|
| 1:30:51| I would just, and I think we would lose money if we basically stopped this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| With that said, I'm glad that Dwight Vanderveet said that we're getting out of the mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| We need to be shed of the mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| We are in the throes of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5472)|
| 1:31:16| I would just hate for us to kind of act out of past misgivings and not extend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5476)|
| 1:31:26| I think Mr. King said that if they wanted to do 230 days, they wouldn't have had to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5486)|
| 1:31:34| I appreciate them telling us what our intentions are and moving forward in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5494)|
| 1:31:43| So I'm in favor of this extension with the clear understanding that we're going to be done with this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5503)|
| 1:31:50| one way or another in the not too distant future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| The auction is going to be on July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| It was about the middle of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| Yes, currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| And on July 13th, I'll assume that they will have a buyer of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| Yes, and it was our intention to bring that successful bidder's offer to the commission in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5531)|
| 1:32:19| And if the contract doesn't end until July 31st, why do we need to have an extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5539)|
| 1:32:31| I mean, is there a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| Because you can't close in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| It would take about 30 to 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| I don't want to speak for NRR, but if you've seen the material out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| it would take quite a bit to mobilize and get themselves into position if they weren't the successful bidder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5563)|
| 1:32:49| to vacate the property so the new owner could come in and set up shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5569)|
| 1:32:59| Yeah, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| Expand upon that just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| It's really being pushed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| And they are pushing it to get it back in front of you all for the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| I mean, we've got an auction that occurs the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| Within 10 days, you're going to be back in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| But when the postponement was made for the purpose of considering some other alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5599)|
| 1:33:31| this body would do some due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| We made the point then, and it is still true, that if, in fact, there isn't an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5614)|
| 1:33:43| and I'm calling it an extension, it's actually a different contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| It's a new contract, not really an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| It's on the same terms as the existing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| But if that is not in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| then the current contractor on site should have been already moving material out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5639)|
| 1:34:08| getting it off there, moving equipment, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| And once we started the process, like I said, we went along with the delays and saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5651)|
| 1:34:18| you're putting us down to the end of this term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| and we're going to be caught in a situation of having too limited a time to try to get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| If we're not going to do that, then we've got to start now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| And once we start that process, we're not going to likely be a bidder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| because that's a substantial cost to get everything off of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| And then move back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| And then turn around and, you know, try to move back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| You just eliminate at least one potential bidder as part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| That's a long way around saying what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| It's just the timing of trying to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| Between the 13th and the end of July is grossly insufficient to clean that site of material and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5696)|
| 1:35:03| I have a question, again, maybe for Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| For the July 13th auction, I know frequently for real estate auctions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| it's not like a house that you may have a 45- or 60-day period to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| Sometimes it's 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| You know, it's just a little bit shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| My question is what is the close date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| Well, I would defer to Mr. Jarrett, but we're going to sell the property by quick claim deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| And, of course, we will turn it over to the law department the day of or the day after the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| so they can start preparing if the commission likes the number they have before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5737)|
| 1:35:45| So, Joe, I mean, typically how long, excuse me, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| how long does it take to go through standard closing with a quick claim deed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| Well, depending upon the process, it's not something you do overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| I mean, you need to get the principles together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| You're going to review the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| It could take a couple of weeks sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| It just depends upon the terms and conditions of the contracts, any last-minute issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5767)|
| 1:36:14| let's say the current owner is not the successful purchaser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| and you've got to get into the terms and conditions of the subsequent purchaser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| and the terms and conditions of vacating the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| It sounds simplistic, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| And I'd hate to tell you that, well, we'll do a turnaround in 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| It's just not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5790)|
| 1:36:37| One other point that may be pertinent to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| and I think I'm right, is that the county proposes at the time of the auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| the announcement, part of the announcement of the auction is that delivery of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| they can't expect delivery of the property until 45 days after the auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5812)|
| 1:36:59| So that would take us until the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5819)|
| 1:37:07| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| As Mr. McKenzie said exactly right, this has been the intention of this mayor to work with Dwight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5830)|
| 1:37:18| in saying we're going to get out of the mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| This 30-day extension is the most orderly way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| The property will be sold, but if we do it without that 30-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| we're going to run into sort of a chaotic phase that simply gives the ability to transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| to have the auction, to bring it back to you, I believe, on the 25th of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| and then it gives the time for the 45-day period for the processing of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| or the changeover of the site, whatever needs to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| It will be done in an orderly way where the taxpayers are not affected negatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| and we also get the $6,000 minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| I want to address the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Commissioners, a couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| Here's what bothers me from what I keep hearing, what I keep seeing and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| We're spinning over so much backward for NRR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| Everything we do, let's see how we can keep them going and keep them going and busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| But then on the other hand, this is a three-year contract that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| Three-year contract that's come up, they act like we just found out about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| God, they've had 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| If they wanted an extension, we should have heard about that maybe some six months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| Another point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| These are not the only people in town that can grind up mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| We can use who the city uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| Can we not just go directly to them and offer the same thing to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| It seems like that everything we're doing, we're trying to keep them in the loop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| keep them in the loop, and you've got a gentleman out here that wants to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| It's just we're making it harder for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| We're cutting the time period just real short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| I wonder who's going to be the bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| I wonder who looks like is going to be the bidder for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| It's just this whole thing just smells to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| I'm not happy the way that we're treating the rest of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| how we're acting like this has to be done just immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| We've not known about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| Commissioner Smith, the reason that I'm in favor of maintaining the contract is so the public doesn't have to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| where they take these public people that have to take their greenways somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| They don't have to try to figure it out for two months when it's at the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| And if NRR does win, then it stays there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| If they don't win, then we have, obviously, a change of venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| But the goal here is to continue service to the public while this is all figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5980)|
| 1:39:47| I don't care who buys the property as long as it goes on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| Brad, if we use this guy here in the city, that's a lot more convenient to come right downtown to take the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| It's down, where's the place called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| What street is that on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| Nobody knows where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| I think it's under I-40 West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| It's a lot more convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Aylor Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| Aylor Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| Nobody knew where it was at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| We had to ask somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| If we just maintain what we have in the contract, then we know where to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| But I'm sure the newspapers could put a nice little map in there and show here's where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| Commissioner Smith, depending on the structure of the agreement that the city has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| the legal structure with this particular contractor would dictate whether we could use it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6029)|
| 1:40:35| It would have to have cooperative procurement language built into the agreement on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| to allow the county to piggyback, is what they call that, for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6040)|
| 1:40:47| Here again, we've had three years to know that this day is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| And you, a question I've got is, with the economy, is this the right time to sell this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| And I do not know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| I am not a real estate person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| But we've got a piece of land over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| It's a whole lot of concrete sitting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| And if we had to sit on it, I mean, I need somebody from the real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| from the commercial end and the industrial end to tell us if this is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6069)|
| 1:41:18| Well, as Commissioner Briggs had stated earlier, I had met with the development corporation a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6078)|
| 1:41:28| as well as our auctioneer, who is a licensed auctioneer, as well as a real estate agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| And, of course, we met with some, contracted with Wilbur Smith to look at the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6095)|
| 1:41:42| And it was determined by the study that Wilbur Smith conducted that this property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6102)|
| 1:41:52| its best and highest use, they would recommend, is what's currently being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| the facilities currently being operated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| to convert that property to a business, commercial or industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| It just wouldn't be a viable option for the development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| It doesn't sound like this guy out here that's going to cost him a lot of money for what he's wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| I mean, it's ready-made for what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| And, of course, I'm leaning on the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| They're telling me the issues of visibility, accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| and lack of infrastructure would make this not a viable option for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6145)|
| 1:42:33| I mean, I'm in the same boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| I'm looking at a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| I'm going to bid on Saturday myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| And I'm going to get it for pennies on the dollar if I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| I mean, there's pluses and minuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| But I'm just looking at it from the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| This is an asset that the taxpayers have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| I'm going to disclaim on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| As an advocate, that's my job, to advocate for a client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| But at the same time, I'm just like every one of you all up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| I'm an Knox County taxpayer, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| And I have an interest in what the taxpayers receive from their government and this body, just like anybody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6187)|
| 1:43:16| I'm going to recall for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| I don't want to argue with my good friend, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| But I'm going to recall for the benefit of the commission that when this subject matter started about selling this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| we said sell it as fast as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| Just get on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| Get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| The only reason we're now asking for a 30-day contract is because this body decided it wanted to delay that sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6218)|
| 1:43:48| while they did some due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| I do not say that was a wrong decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| It probably was a very good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| It was exercising your prerogative to get as much information as you could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| But I did tell you then there are consequences to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| We explained what those consequences were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| And that's the reason we are where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| I do not consider it disruptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| And I do not consider it, if you will, some scheme hatched to benefit NRR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6253)|
| 1:44:21| I think it is indeed the appropriate business and reasonable decision to make to keep this thing in operation until such time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6261)|
| 1:44:32| as it is sold and until such time as if the auction occurs on July the 13th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6272)|
| 1:44:40| and it's knocked down to the highest bidder, that's then brought to this body on July the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| What if you all don't like the price and you say, no, we're not going to approve that contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6286)|
| 1:44:54| You, if you follow the idea that, you know, you should have gone on with it in the past, we'd have to already be off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6294)|
| 1:45:05| We won't really know what the final situation is on this sale until this body acts on July the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6305)|
| 1:45:12| It is grossly inappropriate to suggest they clear off the property in five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6312)|
| 1:45:21| So what is the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| The motion is to defer it until Monday with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6330)|

| 1:48:58| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| Mr. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| In reading this, how long was the last contract for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| I don't remember voting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| That predates us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| Who would have the information on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| Mr. Tory, would you have the information on this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6557)|
| 1:49:23| It looks like 2002, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| We think it's three years, but we'll double check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| and make sure we get that to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| That's our belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| It's three years, but we'll double check that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| and we'll be sure to send that out to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| Because I actually remember it being three years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| And if it was, yes, because we voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| So I think that's my only issue is the term of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| I think we may need to stick with the three-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| unless I'm misunderstanding something about what we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| But I do know that we voted on this particular item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| and I've not been on commission that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| I can change my motion to pass without recommendation until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| I second agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| Before you do that, I second agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| You know, I think we've been very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| Oh, yes, there's no question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| but I think there's somebody that has a question about the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| I think it's only proper to wait until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| Well, if we've been happy about three years, I don't have a problem going five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| Okay, that's one man's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| I have a problem with that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| Well, then, grind it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| So we have a motion and second to pass on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| This resolution was also added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| It's Resolution 905,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| requesting that the Knox County Mayor form an ad hoc committee to review the salary schedules of Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6662)|
| 1:51:09| If I may make a statement here before I ask for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| As you know, we had a lot of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| I've gotten a lot of e-mails, as I'm sure you have, following the vote last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| I have had discussions with the administration about the notion of, for the next budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6678)|
| 1:51:24| is having an ad hoc committee that the mayor would appoint to look at compensation of our county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| and make recommendations for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| My thought process is let's start the process now for next year to see where we are with our county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6692)|
| 1:51:39| to look at their compensation to see what can be done in next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6699)|
| 1:51:44| or if there's anything that can be done in this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| although I don't think anything can be done this year, but I don't want to make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| I'd like to look at next year and have them come to us with some recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| I'd like to see not just a short-term plan, but a long-term plan of where we are with one year, two years, three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6715)|
| 1:52:02| But to have some professionals from our community to take a look at our compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| ask the mayor to appoint this committee and have them report back to the administration and to us within 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6725)|
| 1:52:12| So that's the purpose behind this, and I'll make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Will you sit on that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| This would be a mayoral appointment, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| You need to sit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| So, I mean, if the mayor would ask, I would be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| But I don't want to presume that the mayor would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6752)|

| 1:52:37| Back to page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| Item number 53, report on the Noss County Purchasing Division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| the Noss County Engineering and Public Works Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| regarding the appropriate zoning designated for the properties located at 8706 Joe Daniels Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6768)|

| 1:53:00| Now, this is a report, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| Do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| I believe that we've already given that report, and I think just to summarize things again very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| we had, I think Todd Napier was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| We had, you know, from the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| We had some from engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| We had various, you know, various people that should be aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| And I think the conclusion was is that there was not, from what they relayed to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| there was not any advantage to trying to break this into parcels and rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| And it would, that was their recommendation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| Any further questions or comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| Item number 54 is discussion with the Public Building Authority regarding Sandy Lloyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6823)|
| 1:53:49| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| I brought this up for discussion because a couple of months ago we had a member of the PBA that came up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6834)|
| 1:54:04| and, in not so good terms, basically chastised Mr. Lloyd and that he didn't really know what he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6844)|
| 1:54:15| And I think when we have citizens come and approach us and bring things to light that they seem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6855)|
| 1:54:24| that they feel is wrong, that we should really listen to them and that we should not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6864)|
| 1:54:30| just because we may disagree with their position or whatever, that we, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6870)|
| 1:54:37| ridicule them in public, no government official or any entity that is related to the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6877)|
| 1:54:45| should chastise a citizen, a private citizen, when they bring something to light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6885)|
| 1:54:52| So I just wanted to give Mr. Lloyd his due diligence, his time to basically point out the facts that he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6892)|
| 1:55:03| and then so he has his day, I guess, in the sun, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| So that's the reason I wanted to put it for him for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| and then we can ask him any questions that we wish to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| So if Mr. Lloyd is ready, I think his presentation is, what, about 20 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| At most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| Can you hear me fine from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| Because I've got to stay here with my computer to click through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6924)|
| 1:55:29| Well, first, I've got this up here and hopefully I've handed you all out the handout so you can see the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6929)|
| 1:55:35| As Jeff just said, the primary reason I'm here is because last time there was a commission meeting on 425,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6935)|
| 1:55:42| in which Mr. Smith of the PBA made the comment, in summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| basically almost every accusation, allegation, statement that Mr. Lloyd has made in his articles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| and here before you by simply saying that he simply does not know what he's talking about in regard to what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| and how we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| He may be familiar with other delivery methodologies, but just as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| just a sign of change order, blah, blah, blah, and we're on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| So what I want to do is I'd like to present just a real quick rebuttal in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6966)|
| 1:56:13| since he's questioned my qualifications, I'd like to give those to you, put those on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| I'd like to review with you some facts because the last time I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| Commissioner Smith had asked me for some bullet points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| and I think I've got some summary that will help you see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| And I also want to talk to you about seeing him at risk and the realities of that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| because there has been some dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| I think it's a confusing message that's been sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| And then I want to close with just a couple of comments about PBA competing with private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7002)|
| 1:56:49| As far as my qualifications are concerned, I'm a certified construction manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7009)|
| 1:56:55| I know that Mr. Smith has decided he wanted to poke fun at that a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| because he obviously doesn't have much respect for that, and that's disturbing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| I felt like that's an international ANSI certified certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| and it's considered to be the international gold standard for construction management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| I have a Bachelor of Architecture, which I received with honors from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| and later received my Master's Degree in Structural Engineering from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7039)|
| 1:57:25| My post-college career began in 1976 as a structural engineer for TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| where I worked on structural design for several nuclear plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| And while working there, I attended night school, getting my Master's Degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| and at age 29, I was the Director of Engineering Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| where I supervised 260 employees in a $15 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| I also served for two years as a regional engineer for the American Institute of Steel Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| And for those of you who don't know what that is, that's the national trade organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| that sets the standards for design of steel structures and how they're fabricated by steel fabricators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| I also completed several multi-million dollar projects for an ENR Top 100 general contracting firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| while living in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| I was then recruited to be the Director of New Construction and Development for Bells Enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| I left there in 1988 and founded Construction Plus when I moved back to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| Since then, I have worked for over 100 major clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| and completed over a billion dollars worth of construction work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| Most of that in my 35-year career has been with my name on the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7107)|
| 1:58:34| I've completed virtually every type of building there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| from schools to industrial plants to churches to college football stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7116)|
| 1:58:43| I've been invited to be a guest lecturer at Pellissippi State regarding land development and use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| I served as a guest lecturer for the AISC for Professional Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7128)|
| 1:58:53| their practice lecture series, which is where structural engineers get continuing education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| at several universities around the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| I've been invited by the Tennessee Association of Building Inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| to address their yearly gathering about inspection techniques for steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7144)|
| 1:59:12| I've also been qualified as an expert witness in construction management in three different states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7152)|
| 1:59:19| I'm a member of the Construction Management Association of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| and a fellow at the American Society of Civil Engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7162)|
| 1:59:27| With significant involvement, I've been on the board of the Boys and Girls Club of Tennessee Valley from 2002 to 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7167)|
| 1:59:34| I was the treasurer there for four of those years, and I'm presently on the board of trustees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7174)|
| 1:59:41| While I've been in business for myself, we've won, just recently, won by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| We're awarded the National Blue Ribbon Award for Business Excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| We've won the Enterprise Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| We've won several Project of Distinction Awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| We won an Excel Award for Growth and Leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| We were the first winner of a Pinnacle Award awarded by the Doctoral Chamber of Commerce for Business Excellence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| and we've won three TSBA Schools of the Year Awards, which is for design, quality, and cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7208)|
| 2:00:16| Now, that's a pretty quick rundown, but I hope that that gives you some idea of what my level of background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7216)|
| 2:00:22| my education, and my qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| As far as the awards are concerned, one thing I'd like to say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| I'm not saying that my company or I are qualified because we won these awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| What I'm saying is that we won those awards because we're more than qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| I think that we also understand results, and I understand results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| Now, I hope that that gives you some level of confidence that I have been around the block enough with construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| that I do understand construction management, and I do understand all the different processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| whether it be design, bid, build, design, build, construction management at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| or construction manager agency, which is sometimes called multiple prime contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| Now, I want to go over some things with you about Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| In 2009, after I had made claims about some things that PBA had done that I found to be wasteful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7265)|
| 2:01:12| Mr. Smith said in a letter that he sent to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| subcontract work performed under the construction manager is required to be competitively bid as a matter of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7276)|
| 2:01:27| In 2006, there is a, in everything I'm going to talk to you about right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| I have the written copy of that I procured through the Tennessee Open Records Request from the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| The job report for Hardin Valley Academy, this was noted on June the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| The construction manager noted that electrical and mechanical contracts will need to be under contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| before the final documents are completed for bidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| So, there was, it was acknowledged that they had to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| And I know that when Mr. Smith was here, he was telling you all this is neither unusual or abnormal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| and he had no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| And my concern has been, as I've told you all before, some of you in private, some of you here in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| is very much what Larry, Mr. Smith, was saying earlier about this, the NRR situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| and that is we need to have, don't have any evidence of anything that even looks like something that's improper with public dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7335)|
| 2:02:26| Well, that particular, one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| When he says that we didn't have any, that they competitively bid their projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| that led to July 5th, 2006, when they actually took in proposals for the electrical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7355)|
| 2:02:43| and mechanical services that they had talked about needing to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| Of course, I understand that sometimes you get ready to pour concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| you've got to get the stuff under the slab and all that, but it can be broken to pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| What we did as Knox County, through PBA and through the construction manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7376)|
| 2:03:02| is that we went and we accepted proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| Those proposals included a proposed budget of $7.75 million for the electrical and mechanical work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7386)|
| 2:03:14| The amount that was actually quoted, that was the budget, the quoted amount by Schachter was $8.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7394)|
| 2:03:22| The amount that they were finally paid at the end of the day was $9.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7402)|
| 2:03:28| Now, this is not my speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| This isn't an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7411)|
| 2:03:32| These are facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| That's 24% more than the original budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| And when I asked for all the documentation concerning how they made the decision about awarding this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7417)|
| 2:03:45| they told me that the two pieces of paper I got were the only pieces of documentation that were out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7425)|
| 2:03:55| which is somewhat contrary to what Mr. Smith also said at that 425 meeting when he said, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| the contract Mr. Loy circled in that booklet where it said to be determined that contract was a pre-construction services contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7440)|
| 2:04:07| That's why it had that language that the contractor doesn't warranty or guarantee or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| It's a standard AIA form contract, but it's for pre-construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| That's what he said to you guys in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| That is a complete and total misrepresentation because it's an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7460)|
| 2:04:26| I don't know what Mr. Smith was thinking about, what contract he was thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7466)|
| 2:04:31| but there's only one contract for electrical and mechanical work on Hardin Valley Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| and that's the one that I've already previously given to you all and shown you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7475)|
| 2:04:39| And that's the one that they paid out $9.6 million on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7479)|
| 2:04:46| To give you some ideas as to what I consider to be loose management of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7486)|
| 2:04:52| there's an email on June 6, 2006 from the construction manager to PBA, and this is what it said, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7492)|
| 2:05:00| I believe the amount included in estimate number six is $1.335 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| although I'm not 100% sure on this because I have several estimates from them with different amounts for the concrete work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7505)|
| 2:05:13| And I think this speaks to the level of looseness that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| I understand the context in which this is being said because I'm in the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| and I can understand how the process was going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| But for us to have documentation of public dollars being spent and words in the sentence are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| I believe, estimate, not 100% sure, several estimates, different amounts, I don't know about you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7530)|
| 2:05:39| but none of those words make sense to me in terms of the way we should expect for public dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7539)|
| 2:05:44| to be spent on public projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7544)|
| 2:05:49| Now, I think it's important right here to point out again that in the response to me and to my request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7549)|
| 2:05:55| under the Open Records Act, they made the comment that the enclosed bid tabulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| is the only documentation concerning the concrete package because I asked for all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7560)|
| 2:06:06| But yet, then I go find an e-mail from the construction manager of the PBA which says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| I received two bids yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| Blunt is the apparent low bidder at $1.46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| I would like to meet with the sub immediately and begin negotiations and scope confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| This is the one a few minutes ago, you know, a couple slides back you saw where they said in a previous statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| it was one, the estimate they thought was $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| Now they've got an apparent low bidder at $1.47 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| And now they want to negotiate the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| My point being is that, as Mr. King mentioned earlier when he was talking about the previous topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7596)|
| 2:06:43| you know, when you have a bid, there has to be a scope of work determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| You can't bid when you don't know the scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| So what they've done here is they're moving through this process with a fluid scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7611)|
| 2:07:00| That particular issue came to fruition with concrete costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| It went from the $1.33, we think that's the budget, to a concrete quote of $1.476.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7623)|
| 2:07:10| They cut the contract for $1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| And the final amount paid for that scope of work for that same company is $1.953.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| That's 32% more than the original budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| and 40% more than the guesstimate that they spoke about in the e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7642)|
| 2:07:29| Mr. Smith also made comments to you all about change orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| and said how the change orders are normal and he signs them all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| and how he wouldn't anticipate completing any reasonable-sized project without change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7655)|
| 2:07:40| And I agree with him 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| Change orders are just a necessity of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| But a change order is strictly what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| It's a change to a legal instrument, a legal contract, which is an assignment of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| So when you write a change order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| you're either increasing the compensation consideration or reducing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| adding scope, taking away scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| But what you've got here is a contract that had neither one of those set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7685)|
| 2:08:09| That's why my problem with this process was that the change orders were so mismanaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7689)|
| 2:08:15| Not that there were change orders, there should have been more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| And you're going to see what I mean in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| For example, substantial completion of Hardin Valley was July 1, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7702)|
| 2:08:29| Change order number one was submitted November of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| That's five months after the school was open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| So the problem isn't how many change orders, the problem is how few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7717)|
| 2:08:43| There should have been 40 or 50 change orders written by that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| because you've got a complex project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| As it turns out, the first change order that got submitted had 170 items on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| and it wasn't submitted until five months after the school was completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7734)|
| 2:08:59| Folks, that's just not the way you manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| I can promise you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| I understand enough about construction management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| I've done it for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| I've never, ever read a project in that method and manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| and that's totally irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| Change order number 11 was submitted in November of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| That's another year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| Those 11 change orders added over a half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| to the guaranteed maximum price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| That was without your review, without your consent, without your knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| There's a half a million dollars laying around out there that had been acquired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| was left over, and they found ways to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| The final change order, just for a little punctuation point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| the final change order wasn't signed until February of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7786)|
| 2:09:52| So I want you to go over this one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| For 19 months after that school was opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| there was over a half a million dollars that got spent without review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7798)|
| 2:10:03| by anybody on this governing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7803)|
| 2:10:10| And that's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| That doesn't have anything to do with my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| It doesn't have anything to do with my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| That's a cold, hard, written fact by the PBA's own documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7817)|
| 2:10:23| In 2009, and I want to talk a little bit about seeing at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| because I think it's pretty obvious that I could beat you to death with Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| but I think you've got the gist of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| And I want to talk to you about construction management risk real fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| because this has been really kind of where it got started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| as far as some of our discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| In 2009, Mr. Smith wrote to you, the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| in responding to my claims that CM at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| the way they practice it is a misnomer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| And his defense of that was Mr. Loy advocates for the CM agency method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| Under the CM agency method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| the owner retains substantial financial and legal risks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| and the CM agent firm itself has almost none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7864)|
| 2:11:05| That's what he told you in the written letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| So what he was saying there is he's defending CM at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| because that protects the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| He loves that word at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| and the construction manager is going to be at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| so that's why we're going to use that method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| And Mr. Loy doesn't know what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| He wants to use CM agency because that's what his company does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| and so therefore we're going to discredit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| Now let me tell you, now let's look at something else that's really interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| In 2011, at the standard of this podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| when Mr. Andrews questioned him about some things about these contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7893)|
| 2:11:39| his response was, I didn't name the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| CM at risk is just what it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| He prefaced that with, are you asking me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| does the contract protect the CM from risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| I didn't name the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| CM at risk is just what it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| This is what he just substantiated what I've been trying to tell everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| on this body and the school board for the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| and that it's a very convenient term to use and tell people, such as yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7924)|
| 2:12:10| that are not in the business and are not familiar with this contract language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| that CM at risk is a really great thing and it'll protect the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| And it doesn't, and I'm not saying it can't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| but again, it's all about the manner in which it's executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| So I want to make sure you understand what I just said there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| is that in 2009, he uses the term at risk to defend what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| and then in 2011, when questioned about the realities of how that was practiced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| he basically took the out that, well, I didn't name it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| That's just the name of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| Now, for example, one section of the CM at risk contract, which, again, as he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7965)|
| 2:12:49| is a standard AIA form document, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| It wasn't written just for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| It's been used 100,000 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| It says, the CM does not warrant or guarantee estimates and schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| Now, that's a CM at risk contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| It also says when drawings and specifications are sufficiently complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| the CM will propose a guaranteed maximum price, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| There's nothing wrong with that, that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| but what I think everybody needs to understand is the contract is written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=7998)|
| 2:13:22| with the understanding that you get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| and you don't have sufficient drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| They're not complete, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| But when they are complete, the proper thing to do as a CM at risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| is to submit what is the guaranteed maximum price with the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| and at that time, you then become at risk, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| Nothing wrong with that process at all, except when it's abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8022)|
| 2:13:47| In this particular case, you have the CM contract written in December of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8027)|
| 2:13:54| The drawings were complete in September of 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| and by the notes on their own drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| on their own minutes to their own meetings on the job site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| in which there were people from every government body in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| it said that they were going to start guaranteed maximum price negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| in October of 2006, which would have been the proper time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| That guaranteed maximum price was not set until December of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| That's 14 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| That means that for 24 months, the construction manager operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| with exactly zero risk while the budget was fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| That's why you didn't have any change orders being written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| because the contract wasn't determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| If you all wonder why the budget, why the price kept on going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| it's because it was never determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| It's why there was $30 million, $40 million, $50 million, $38 million, $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| It was bouncing all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| That's because nobody ever knew what it was, and this is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| You didn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| There was no guaranteed maximum price in that contract until December of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8094)|
| 2:15:04| Now, we've been operating under the auspices that all this is legal for the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8104)|
| 2:15:11| because of the fact that PBA law is so broadly written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| and it allows PBA to basically ignore all local procurement rules and law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8115)|
| 2:15:24| I just got an interesting email recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| This came through Senator Dunn's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8128)|
| 2:15:32| This came from a legislative attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| Her name is Sally Swaney, and the reason that she was looking into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| is because I've been talking to state legislators about the fact of closing up this loophole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| of letting PBAs across the state do things that, in my opinion, are very wasteful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8143)|
| 2:15:51| such as what I just went through with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| just a series of things of going two years with no set amount on a contract with government money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8153)|
| 2:16:00| This is what she said in her subject line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| Look what I found, just found under 49-2203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| This is what the state law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| This section is dealing with construction of school buildings which utilize a construction manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| In paragraph C under that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| construction work that is under the coordination and oversight of a construction manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| shall be procured through competitive bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| Then she goes on in her own words to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| so first what you're asking for is already in the law, just in a different section of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| If this wasn't happening, someone's violating the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8190)|
| 2:16:34| So, we now are back to the discussion about competitive bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8194)|
| 2:16:41| And, again, I was listening to some of the previous discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| and people were talking about, well, what's a competitive bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| I mean, I think that's something that needs to be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| and I think that's something that has to be made more clear as to exactly what does that involve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| But I think that this right here puts enough doubt out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| as to whether or not even these practices, are they even legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8217)|
| 2:17:03| Now, I want to close up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| I want to just say a couple of statements about the competing with private businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| Again, Mr. Smith made the comment that he wasn't apologetic about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| and he didn't have any problem with saving local or surrounding counties money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8232)|
| 2:17:18| I want to say one thing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| As a taxpayer, I want to tell you that as much as I like Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| I live close to it and I have friends in Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| I don't have any desire to subsidize Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| And if one of our government agencies goes down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| and takes work away from a Knox County business and does it for 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| first off, I find that hard to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8259)|
| 2:17:43| But if they do do it for 20%, then that means that we pay for the rest of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| because you get what you pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| There's no way you're going to get something done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8269)|
| 2:17:53| that private enterprise is going to say it costs a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8273)|
| 2:17:56| and the government does it for 20 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| If it costs a dollar, then who paid the other 80 cents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| And my point is that Knox County taxpayers shouldn't be paying money to subsidize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| whether it be Loudoun County or Sullivan County or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| I would like to mention the fact that David Moon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| who some of you all may or may not know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| he wrote in the Knoxville News Sentinel in his article a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| quote, when I served as treasurer of the Knox County PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| there was some discussion at the time about whether or not the agency should offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| construction and contract management services in areas outside Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8309)|
| 2:18:34| thereby placing the taxpayer-funded entity in direct competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| with private businesses that provided the same services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| They paid substantial local taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| a portion of which would have been used to subsidize a new competitor in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| Additionally, the two shareholders of the PBA, the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| were in a position of authority and regulatory responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| over many of the aspects of these private businesses' operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| in the construction management industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| It was a terrible plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| I argued against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| It was morally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| It was bad economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| Mr. Moon resigned over this issue from the PBA board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8349)|
| 2:19:13| and kudos to him for standing up for what he believed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8353)|
| 2:19:17| I think it's also important to note that Congressman Duncan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8357)|
| 2:19:21| has filed a legislative bill to stop this practice at the federal level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| to keep federal government from competing with private business for the same exact reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8366)|
| 2:19:33| One more thing I'd like to point out before I close up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| and that is that you all may or may not be aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| but the state attorney general just filed an ouster suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| against the commissioners for Powell Utility District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| for lack of institutional control over the administrators there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| after they were made aware that there were problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| One commissioner made the quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| we believed what the director told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| Now they're all facing ouster suits from the state attorney general's level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| I think that's exactly one of the same reasons why the PBA board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| despite I've probably contacted them no less than eight times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| I get zero response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| They don't have any interest in having any response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| or discussion about any of these matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| and I think it's because they go on the defensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| and they're defending what they're being told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| without trying to find out if what they're being told is true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8422)|
| 2:20:27| So my summary of what I would highly recommend that the commission consider doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8427)|
| 2:20:34| is to, one, audit the PBA at the transactional level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| Is Hardin Valley an isolated case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| I don't know. I'm not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| Did that just happen a couple of times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| Or how many other places has it happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| I've heard from PBA employees that are scared of their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| but they seem to think there are problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| They can't come forward because they're afraid they're going to get the whistleblower beating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| And I think it's important to realize that an audit, as you all talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| and I certainly, Mr. Wallace is back here, he's the expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| but audits are performed at all different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| We don't need an audit to go in and find out if their numbers add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| We need an audit to go in and check their processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| and to make sure that they're operating within state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8478)|
| 2:21:22| and also within Knox County taxpayers' best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| I'd like for you to investigate whether or not the way the PBA practices these bid negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8486)|
| 2:21:34| is, in fact, in conflict with state law, as I presented to you a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| I believe that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| I think you should stop PBA from competing with local taxpaying businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8500)|
| 2:21:46| And I think, at the very least, that you need to stop the waste of noncompetitive bids being awarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8506)|
| 2:21:52| which they may call them competitive bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8512)|
| 2:21:54| but putting a competitive bid, the term on a piece of paper, doesn't make it a competitive bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8514)|
| 2:22:00| You know, I can go over there and put a Tennessee football jersey on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8520)|
| 2:22:02| That doesn't make me a football player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| So, this is something that needs to be looked into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| and that's the summary of what I would highly recommend and hope that you guys would consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8528)|
| 2:22:14| I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8534)|
| 2:22:17| Mr. Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| Thank you, Mr. Loy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| I've been listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| I've been researching as much as my expertise will take me, and I'm no accountant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8546)|
| 2:22:33| But some of the stuff I've researched and talked to other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8553)|
| 2:22:42| whether this is an isolated issue or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8562)|
| 2:22:47| And I have questioned for over a year now the cost of Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8567)|
| 2:22:52| Why did it have to be that much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| And the bonds that we have on it currently are an interest-only bond right now for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8574)|
| 2:23:03| and then we're going to start paying on the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| So, this school could easily cost us $200 million once it's said and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8586)|
| 2:23:12| And to me as a taxpayer, it concerns me that we would spend that much money on a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8592)|
| 2:23:22| It's just astounding to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| And I question, is this the practice that we use on building everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| Is this the way PBA operates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| If it is, who's watching them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| Who's questioning what they're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| And it's a shame that private citizens have to take their resources and their funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8618)|
| 2:23:45| to investigate a government entity, something that we're giving money to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| We talked earlier about, you know, auditing back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| And we're auditing back over $150,000 basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8633)|
| 2:23:59| This is millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| And we're not talking about auditing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| And they get millions from us a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| I'm not saying they're doing anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| I'm not saying that everything that's in here is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| But do they need to be audited just like we would audit back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| anybody else that receives county funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| Yes, they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| And if there is any wrongdoing, I mean, had a private citizen not brought up the NRR situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8660)|
| 2:24:26| what was going out there, we wouldn't have found the things that we did find in the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| So, do I think we need an audit on the PBA and not just the Hardin Valley but everything that county touches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8672)|
| 2:24:41| Yes, I do agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| And, I mean, I get it audited every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| I mean, when I turn in my taxes, if they don't like what they see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8686)|
| 2:24:49| they come back and I have to supply all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| And I don't receive county funds other than my salary here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| But I just find this eye-opening, what you've presented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8698)|
| 2:25:05| And I would encourage every other commissioner should be just as concerned about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8705)|
| 2:25:10| as they would be of Beck or anybody else that is receiving county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8710)|
| 2:25:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110620?start=8718)|
