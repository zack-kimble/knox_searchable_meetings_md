| 0:00:31| Good afternoon. We're going to go ahead and get started with a moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=31)|
| 0:00:34| and the Pledge of Allegiance led by Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=34)|
| 0:01:00| Welcome to the Knox County Board of Education August 4th Work Session. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=60)|
| 0:01:22| regular session will be held in this room next Wednesday, August 11th and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| will begin at 5 p.m. Tonight, I see Commissioner Randy Smith in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| audience. Thank you for being here, Commissioner. I don't think we have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| other elected officials. Thanks so much for being here. Our teachers have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| returned to school this week and I just wanted to take a moment to welcome them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| back and thank them for their hard work on preparations for this school year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| students report back on Monday for a half day. That's on August 9th, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| looking forward to having students back in the classrooms. Are there any requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| changes to this Work Session agenda? Okay, do we have a motion to approve? We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=118)|
| 0:02:06| motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Bounds. Thank you. Mr. McMillan? I object to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=126)|
| 0:02:15| approving the agenda. Okay. Would you like for me to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| Certainly. Okay. We've discussed mass thoroughly, I believe. We spent hours upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=140)|
| 0:02:35| hours discussing this and people want to talk about the CDC now. They changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=155)|
| 0:02:48| their mind. They won't release the information, all the information that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| they have. I just think we'll go through it and talk about it tonight and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| we'll go through the very same thing next week. So, I intend to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=181)|
| 0:03:10| against that and it's my understanding that in order to approve it, they must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=190)|
| 0:03:20| have or it must carry five positive votes. Is that correct? Correct. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=200)|
| 0:03:32| wanted people to know where I stood. You know, you can join me or you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| throw rotten tomatoes at me, whatever you want to do. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| Any other comments? Mr., I'm not sure who had their light on first. Ms. Owen? I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| going to ask if the objection is to the whole agenda or to a specific item. Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| McMillan, are you objecting to the whole agenda or a specific item on, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| actually on next week's agenda. Is that your question, Ms. Owen? Yes, ma'am. I object to that, but I don't, you know, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=242)|
| 0:04:13| see that we'll accomplish anything. What are you wanting to do, Ms. Owen? Just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=253)|
| 0:04:22| tell me straight out what you want to do. I'm trying to determine whether your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| objection is to our entire agenda or to an item on the agenda. Well, do you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| to talk about mass tonight? Just answer me that, yes or no. Since we're not to that agenda item, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| trying to determine whether the entire agenda. No, but we usually approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| agenda, as you well know, at the front end. Right. And that's what I'm trying to get to. We set the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| agenda for the evening and we're about to do that. Since we're not looking at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=288)|
| 0:04:55| consent agenda, maybe Mr. Dupler can help us with procedure, but I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| could object to that item when it comes up. Mr. Dupler. Well, thank you, Madam Chair. So, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=301)|
| 0:05:13| agenda for tonight includes nine items. It sounds like Mr. McMillan is objecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=313)|
| 0:05:23| to item seven, but to get into item seven about particular items on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=323)|
| 0:05:32| agenda for next week, I mean, that's not technically on the agenda for tonight. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| I mean, so the way I'm reading the agenda is, I mean, Mr. McMillan could object to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| item seven or he could object to the whole agenda. That's tonight's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| obviously. I mean, which is the only thing that you can vote on tonight. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| Mr. Watson. Okay, so, okay, so basically the agenda, or the motion that's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| the floor, is to approve the agenda for this evening, which includes discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| of next week's agenda. Exactly. Okay, any other comments? Okay, all in favor? Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=368)|
| 0:06:20| opposed? No. Let's have a roll call. Okay, we can do a roll call, that's fine. Okay, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=380)|
| 0:06:30| I'm sorry, Ms. Coatney. Ms. Satterfield. Can you tell me exactly what? Yes. I hear you, Mr. Mike, but I also want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| talk about some of the stuff on the agenda, so that's why I'm going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| with the vote, but tell me how to do it. So, the roll call vote will be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| approve this work session agenda only. Yes. Ms. Owen. Yes. Mr. Watson. Yes. Ms. Babb. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=406)|
| 0:06:54| Ms. Henderson. Yes. Ms. Bounds. Yes. Mr. McMillan. No. Ms. Christy. Yes. Ms. Horne. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| Seven yes votes and one no vote. Okay, motion carries. Okay, thank you. We'll get into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| discussion later on regarding the agenda for August 11th. Okay, okay, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=428)|
| 0:07:16| move to Superintendent Thomas's report for this evening. Well, I'm sorry, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=436)|
| 0:07:24| actually skipped the vision and mission spotlight. I'm sorry, Superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| Thomas, I'll go back to that. We don't have a specific initiative or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| highlight this evening, but I did want to take a moment to spotlight our mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| statement, which was developed in conjunction with our current strategic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=457)|

| 0:07:51| sincerest hope that Knox County Schools continues to work toward the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=471)|

| 0:09:07| teachers reported to their buildings this week, and I'm very thankful for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=547)|

| 0:12:23| contracts one or two? Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. On item one, are these new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=743)|
| 0:12:32| vehicles in addition to ones that we already have, or are they to replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| vehicles that we already have in service? Mr. Oaks, do you want to take that one? I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| sorry, can you? Yes. Are the vehicles in number one that are being purchased, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| these additional vehicles or to replace vehicles that we are moving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| No, these are replacement vehicles. We're buying nine and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| surplusing or trading in ten for these nine. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Oaks, I know that this quote that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| potentially approving is from Murphy's Bureau. When we look to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| vehicles, do we also look within the County of Knoxville, or do we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| preferred vendor that we look to, or how do we decide that? We buy off of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| state contract, and that's who the state contract is with. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| Any other questions? All right, moving on to... I'm sorry, Ms. Harris. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| I just want to look at agenda item number two. I know we had a meeting last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| week, but I do think it'll be just worthwhile, just a brief statement, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| when it's all said and done, what will Knox County look like in four years with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| this program in place? So just like an overview of the Next Generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| Next Gen Foundation, if you don't mind. Okay, Dr. Ryser, do you want to take that? Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| Let me clarify my questions to make sure you understand. Okay. When we're done, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| know the roadmap is three, four years from now, in a sense. What would our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| and our county look like, ideally, if everything was implemented to fidelity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| and with greatness? That's a good question, Ms. Satterfield, and so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| we have some beginning vision of what we think that could look like, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| think, as Donna and Jane shared last week, I mean, it really is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| process. So there's not an end in mind that says, hey, we'll look just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| like this. I think there's some key things we can look for, but really, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| think, between now and Christmas and beyond, we'll start seeing a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| those processes that involve business and the mayors and people like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| kind of really picturing what is it that we want it to look like. I think one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| the most important things that we're excited about is developing that profile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| of a graduate that really helps us define, you know, sometimes in things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| mission statements, you can have the, you know, kids to have multiple choices to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| whatever, blah, blah, blah, you know, but we really want to think about what does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| that look like, like what are the things that we want every freshman in high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| school, sophomore, high school, junior, so by the time they're seniors and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| graduate, what characteristics are we looking for, what data points that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| they've achieved at certain levels, what experiences have they had. Those are kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| of things that we want to make sure we define and then backward plan from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| across the board, so it'll look a little different, I think, potentially in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| every community because some of the programming will be different and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| of the options and some of the business partners and that sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| thing will be, but kind of, if I were going to summarize right now, I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| our goal is to have a robust advanced academic program and a robust CTE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| program in every one of our communities in high school so students can stay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| their neighborhood and have that exposure. There'll be some things later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| on this evening in the ESSER plan that I think will, there are some kind of more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| tangible deliverables that we think can be part of that process as we move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| but I think ultimately community involvement, elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| involvement, you're all involved in painting what that vision is so that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| students can succeed once they graduate. Perfect, thank you. I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| reiterate for anybody that might have missed the meeting last time and then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| will also just like to request frequent updates regarding the process of how it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| goes. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. Ms. Babb. Yeah, I just want to say because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| think probably a lot of people don't pay attention to our workshops, but I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| on the school board for three years and this is probably, I think, the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| exciting thing we've been talking about since I've been on the school board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| really trying to get some direction and I love the fact that we're getting an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| outside group to come in and help guide it, but the fact that it's not a cookie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| cutter program, it really is coming in and trying to figure out how to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| with our schools, with our community, with our partners, and really making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| customized to us, but I was very excited just because I think people talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| CTE all the time and academics and where kids are supposed to go, whether it's to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| college or straight into professions, and I think this really speaks to that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| will really help guide us moving forward, so I just want to thank everybody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| was involved with the work. I know, you know, the executive team of Mox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| Schools definitely was, but I'm really, really excited that we're working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| this. Thank you, Ms. Babb. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I also wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| echo the appreciation of the team and I've not been on the school board three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| years, but I'm very excited about the potential here and for the same reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| that Ms. Babb mentioned. I also love the fact that we're engaging the community to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| the degree that we are and bringing stakeholders to the table to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| influence this vision for Knox County Schools moving forward. I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| seeing that in the Ford work and we're also been seeing that in the ESSER work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| I think it speaks to the power of involving the community in these types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| of decisions, so thank you all for doing that. Thank you, Mr. Watson. Okay, moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| on to three and four. Five or six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1072)|
| 0:18:00| Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. Could someone speak to item six and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| how the McNabb program is going to work with our schools? What schools will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| served? What size population? Ms. Cook, would you like to take that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| Dr. Reiser. Thank you, Ms. Horne. Thank you, Ms. Owen. I'll actually have Janice come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| and speak maybe in more detail to it, but this is a life training skills group, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| we do multiple things with McNabb. So this is a program particular for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| my understanding, again, as Janice comes up, I'll let her speak to that more, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| kind of early identification of students who may have been exhibiting at-risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| behaviors in school, and so we would have a program by which we could work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| those students and kind of in sessions to counsel, but Janice will be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| tell you a lot more detail. Thank you. So this is a different contract than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| usual contract that we talked about with McNabb. So this is life skills that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| provide. I have a list. I'd have to go in and pull it up so I can get that to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| if there's different schools that it's in. This is a contract that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| had. It's been in place. This is not a new contract. I'm not looking for real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| granular specificity, just kind of generally. So they go in and they work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| with students that, as Dr. Reiser said, that have been identified that need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| additional supports, the at-risk kids, sometimes class, class activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1168)|
| 0:19:40| Thank you. Okay, any questions on seven or eight? Ms. Owen, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1180)|
| 0:19:51| Okay, okay. Nine or ten? Eleven? Twelve or thirteen? Okay, moving to board policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1191)|
| 0:20:08| and just for the sake of those watching, the board has gone through and discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| the board policies that are on our agenda previously, but are there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| questions on either of the first two policies? Okay, C or D? Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1217)|
| 0:20:28| Mr. Dupre, would you mind speaking to the reason for some of these policy changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| relative to state law change? Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watson, the, all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1235)|
| 0:20:45| changes that have been recommended by our office have been due to recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| changes in the law, which have occurred following the 2021 legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| And specifically in relationship to policy C-250 and policy I-171, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| we're not there yet, the question is the same. In the state statutes, both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| statutes have requested that school boards adopt language in policy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| reflect those laws, is that correct? That's correct. Thank you. Thank you. Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1275)|
| 0:21:23| Owen? Mr. Dupre, if you could also speak just a little bit to G-280, I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| several questions from teachers that are concerned about the new definition of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1289)|
| 0:21:36| the teacher. And I know that's from legislation, but if you could speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| that just a bit to reassure them that we haven't just come up with that on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| own. Okay, Mr. Dupre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1306)|
| 0:21:55| So, yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Owen. The, again, the change comes directly from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| a new law, and I think I can even tell you if I can get it blown up. My eyes aren't what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1322)|
| 0:22:09| they used to be, but get it blown up. So, it's going to be codified under TCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| 49-3-323, and that section talks about a definition of teachers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| that teachers must spend 50% or more of their time on instructing students in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| class. That was, again, straight out of that out of that state law, and to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| honest, it was mainly around a definition for the BEP purposes. Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| Dupre. Any other questions on board policies? Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| Chair. I thought you were only referencing the first two. I do have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| question around G-470. It's really not a question. In our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| policy review, we talked about changing line 14 to not just make it male| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| dominant, and that change was made to his or her, but also line 16, that change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| should also be made to where it's the principal or his or her designee. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| change was dismissed. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| All right, any other questions or comments on board policies? Okay, moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1398)|
| 0:23:26| to grants. Questions on A? Okay, B or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1406)|
| 0:23:38| D or E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| F or G?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| Okay, moving to contracts. Questions on the contract? We have one on there. Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1428)|
| 0:23:55| questions? Okay, regular agenda items. Questions on A? Mr. Watson. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1435)|
| 0:24:08| Madam Chair. Superintendent Thomas, I remember when we were passing the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| for this coming year, there was a substitute motion to look at this if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| funding allowed. Can you give a little bit of a description about what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| allowing us to do this now? I think there's your intent is even to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| beyond what we were suggesting relative to that increase with bonuses. Can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| just speak to that? Okay, I'm sorry. I do have a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| problem. The mask complicates that, so if you could please repeat it. Sure, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| it's item A under a regular agenda of items, and when we passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| the budget back in whenever we did that for this coming school year, we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| referenced the desire to increase by an additional 4%. Can you just speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| what's allowing us to do that? And also, there's some additional steps being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| taken to offer bonuses as well to custodians. Can you just speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| Right, and I think when the budget was approved, Mr. Watson, I believe, made the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| amendment that was approved actually that said if we received some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| revenue through BEP that we would look at applying that additional revenue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| three categories of employees, custodians, educational assistants, and school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| secretaries. And the problem with BEP was it remained constant throughout. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| already received our July final, and that didn't change. However, the sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| tax revenue that's coming in is actually really strong. We feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| that we do have a little bit of room within our existing budget to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| ahead and make this change to provide the 4% to the categories I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| just mentioned, as well as give the incentive. I know Mr. Oaks and also Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| McPherson, we talked about this, and I think there's been almost like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| 70 vacancies, I think, with custodial positions. And certainly what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| intend to do is maintain sanitation cleanliness of our schools, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| trying to do everything we can to really fill those vacancies. And we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| had the same kind of issues with educational assistants in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| vacancies. And then also, I know, as far as the incentive goes, our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| nutrition workers vacancies there, that incentive would go, too. But we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| feel like we could cover this within our general purpose budget, that revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| sales tax revenues, continue to be really strong. If we had to go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| make an additional appropriation, we feel confident that the funds would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| there to make sure that we don't get ourselves in a budgetary situation. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| I know, you know, everybody works hard, but we know that the folks in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| categories, it's really been hard to try to fill positions. They work hard and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| they certainly deserve, it's closer to a living wage. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| saying this will give you a living wage, but it's better than what it's been. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| I don't know if there are additional questions. Mr. McPherson probably could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| address those, but I hope that answered your questions. Yes, sir. And thank you, by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| the way, for making that amendment to allow this to happen. So I know our folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| will be very appreciative to the board. Thank you, Superintendent Thomas. Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| Babb. Yeah, this is just a quick question, just from my knowledge, and it's probably from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| Mr. McPherson. Does something like this, do we have to do it back through County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| Commission, or is this just within our purview to pass? Thank you, Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1643)|
| 0:27:30| Babb. If we were to technically go back and amend the budget, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| other words, if we were to go back and say we want to increase revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| projections in order to do this, then yes, it would have to go back. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1659)|
| 0:27:47| our plan is, though, is we went through and looked historically at dollars that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| close into fund balance, or dollars that are saved through the personnel line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| items. We will use those at times to cover overages in other areas by the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| of the year, if that happens. Historically, the trend looks like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| could actually cover this in the existing budget through just savings in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| employee turnover. We've had so many vacancies, unfortunately, that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| not going to hire all these people all in one day, obviously. So there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| reason to believe there's not going to continue to be turnover. If at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| of the year, and we do this every year, if we see that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| personnel line items have run over, we'll cover it through savings in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| If sufficient savings are not in other budgetary line items, then we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| reserves, as Mr. Thomas talked about, significant reserves resulting from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| sales tax revenue. So at that point, if we were to formally amend the budget, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| would have to go back to County Commission. The process that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| it here, though, would not require that at this point. Thank you. So that means that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| if we approve this next week, principals could then go right ahead and hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| based on that new approval. Yes, ma'am. Great. Okay, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| All right, any other questions on that one? Okay, items B and C were withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| Moving to C, I'm sorry, D. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. First, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1752)|
| 0:29:23| wanted to speak to why items B and C were withdrawn and replaced with item D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| Following our meeting June 30th, when Superintendent Thomas in his board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| report announced what we would be doing related to COVID protocols for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| coming school year, I reached out to Superintendent Thomas and Chief Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| and Gary Dupler related to the implications of that in that at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1784)|
| 0:29:51| April 14th meeting, the board had approved five to four to follow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| Tennessee Department of Health guidelines. There was subsequent votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| relating to sunsetting the masking policy first on August the 1st and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| in May and so I had some confusion and started working with the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| and his team to try to understand what were the implications relative to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| vote in April. So my attempt in item D is to, was to combine B and C. The wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1815)|
| 0:30:23| mandating Tennessee Department of Health guidelines in C actually came from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| Dupler and my intent, I know Mr. McMillan talked about not wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| talk about masks, I don't want to talk about the efficacy of masks. The specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| item is discussion and possible action regarding the board and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| superintendent's authority concerning the implementation of public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| protocols as it relates to the superintendent's KCS Connect 21-22 plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| as approved on April the 14th. So that is my intent is to have a discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| what is our relative authority to COVID protocols as it relates to that vote and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| any subsequent messaging that we're providing through KCS. Mr. Dupler, you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| produced a memo to the board that describes some of your and the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| department's opinion related to this issue. Is that something, is that attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| to this agenda and if not when would that be available to be open to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| public, that memo? Mr. Dupler. Thank you Madam Chair, Mr. Watson. It's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| understanding it's not attached to the memo but... Attached to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Correct. Attached to the agenda but any board member can make it available. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| mean it's his or her own choice. Okay, so it could be made available at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| should the, should any board member choose to do that. Okay, so Mr. Dupler I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| read the memo and I appreciate all the work that you all did on that. Can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| tell me when that work started to develop that memo in terms of sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| down and drafting that? It started after you asked the question that's basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| set out in item D. Okay, and that was, that question was produced sometime late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| last week and so you all did a tremendous amount of work to get to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1935)|
| 0:32:19| opinion at this point. So let me make sure I'm understanding the memo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| correctly and I'm going to request that it get added to the agenda so the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1946)|
| 0:32:33| can see the memo. Basically from what I understand from the memo, Mr. Dupler, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| that our vote on April the 14th following, to follow the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| Department of Health guidelines, that the superintendent, even today, could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| enact any of those. There was probably about five or six COVID protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| bullet-pointed in that plan. He currently could enact any of those and has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| authority to do that but because the board sunset the policy related to masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| first at the April meeting and then subsequently at the May meeting, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| board basically has taken away his authority to implement any type of face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| covering requirement for Knox County schools. Is that correct? That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| Okay, so there's a tremendous amount of confusion around this issue and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| certainly one of those that's confused and I want to just point out a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| reasons why I'm confused and I would like to try to get to some clarity. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| on April the 16th, after that vote was made on April the 14th, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| superintendent, via the KCS Connect page, sent out a message and part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| message was, I also want to share an important update regarding the 21-22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| school year. This week the Board of Education approved a proposal to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| the Tennessee Department of Health's COVID-19 guidelines in the upcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| school year. An updated copy of those recommendations may be found here. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| recommendations are also attached to this agenda and in that, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| recommendations, it did speak about face coverings as well as four or five other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| different protocols. At that same meeting, we did agree to sunset the mask policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| on August, at that point, August 1st. It subsequently changed in May. So when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| superintendent sent that and notified the public that we would be following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| the Tennessee Department of Health guidelines, even as it pertains to masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| was he acting outside of his authority to do that? I don't know that I can answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2080)|
| 0:34:50| that question because that was at a different time. Obviously, other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| things have occurred since then. I understand, but what you just answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| previously was that the thing that has prevented the superintendent from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| implementing a mask requirement in Knox County schools is the fact that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| sunset the policy. Well, we had sunset the policy that night. We had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| approved that. For August the 1st? Correct. 2021? Right. So it was still in effect at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| that time? Right, but the plan that was also approved that night was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| determined to take effect until after that. And even though we said the sunset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| at two months earlier, are you saying that the date of the sunset impacts his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| authority? Yes. So if we would have left it August 1st, then he would have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| authority? Yes, the policy would have still been in effect until August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| But this plan does not take effect until after August 1st. That's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| point that I'm making, is that the plan does not take effect until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| after August the 1st. The plan that was approved on April the 14th. Okay. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| because that plan was approved to not take place until after the 14th, or I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| mean until the school year, and in that plan it referenced face coverings, either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| whether it's May or August, the policy had agreed to be sunset. So how does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| that impact the plan that was also approved? I think we're just taking, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2180)|
| 0:36:29| mean, with all respect, I mean, I think you're taking things out of context. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| mean, what happened was, I mean, and Bob Thomas can speak for himself, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| Superintendent Thomas pushed out guidance based upon this Connect plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| that was indeed approved April 14th of 2021. Then there was the immediate vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| after that to sunset the policy as of August the 1st. Then in May, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| the vote to sunset the policy even earlier, as of the end of the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| semester. So, and again, we didn't have all the information at that point. Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Because from going back and looking at the meetings, and I know you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| too, you know, the meetings show that that we had incomplete information. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| was still a limited state of emergency pushed out by the governor at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| But however, by the end of May, that limited state of emergency expired with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| regard to school systems and was even strengthened as of the end of July of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| this year. Superintendent Thomas, when you sent out that communication on April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| the 16th that referenced the plan for this coming school year, and we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| already agreed to sunset the policy August 1, and that plan referenced face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| coverings, did you believe you were being contradictory because that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| referenced face coverings and it was published on the KCS website? Oh, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| know, in addition to what the board approved on April 14th, you approved, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| board approved, by majority vote, that this guidance may change in several ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| as the year progresses. Any guidance issued by the state would take precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| In my mind, precedence means more important than what the previous thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| was. So, you know, in terms of following the guidelines, you know, as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| Doopler stated, the emergency order was lifted at that point, and since that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| point in time, the governor has said he's not in favor of mandating face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| I'm in favor of the recommendations made by the CDC, the Tennessee Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| Health, but they're recommendations, they're not requirements. It's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| mandate. The Commissioner of Health has said that she is not mandating masks. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| optional. It should be a family decision. Those are state officials. I also talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| to a local official this afternoon, Mayor Jacobs. Mayor Jacobs says he is not in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| favor of mandating masks and he supports what we're doing right now. So I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| know what difference it made, what I thought on April 14th. That's four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| ago. And really, continuing to talk about April 14th, to me, is, pardon me, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| know, I think it's a waste of time since it's four months ago. So, you know, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| ask me the question, I've been told, and it's in writing, I don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| authority. That's the board's authority. If you want to implement and mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| masks, I would suggest you put it on your agenda for next week and you vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| it. If you want to give me the authority, as far as face masks are concerned, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| I'm going to go back to what the governor has recommended, that there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| there, it's recommended, but it's not mandated. Commissioner of Health has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| that. Our own local health director, prior to today, said that she was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| mandating masks for the community and then turned around and mandated masks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| schools to make it a requirement. I don't understand that either. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| we're trying to have school, it's about school, and I want to have safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| for our students, but again, we've heard what the governor has said, what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| Commissioner of Education has said, what our mayor has said. The majority, in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| mind, maybe I'm wrong, you vote on it tonight or next week, board members, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| majority of board members have said we don't want to mandate face coverings. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| if y'all change on that, we will mandate face coverings. I mean, we'll, I'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| glad to do that. It's just whatever you want to tell me, tell me to do. So, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| you. You know, I really don't understand why we're continuing to talk about April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| 14th when that's four months ago, and I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas. I appreciate your frustration. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| frustrated as well. This is the, out of the nine times we've talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| issue, this is the only time that I brought it up, and again, the reason, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| only reason I brought it up is because of trying to understand the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| given to the superintendent and the board, and as Mr. Duklar said, this MOMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| was not produced until the last four days, to bring some clarity to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| Currently, on the KCS Connect website, it says, as always, we will continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| consult with the Knox County Health Department and to review guidance from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| the Tennessee Department of Education and the Tennessee Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| If circumstances related to COVID-19 change, we will respond promptly in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| coordination with these agencies. Can you help me and the public understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| it means that we would respond promptly when it seems like there's limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| authority at this point? I think, from my standpoint, what that means, if Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| Lee, as he did in the spring of, what was it, 20, I guess, when he mandated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| schools closed or said to close, we closed, if the governor says, hey, face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| coverings are required, and you know, Gary, Mr. Duklar, you help me out on this if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| wrong, then, you know, I think we would have to come back and say, hey, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| under governmental order at this point to require face masks, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| what we do. Or, if the Commissioner of Health has that authority, or you as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| Board of Education have that authority, then, in my mind, it changes based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| on those things. I mean, I just have one final question. So, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| Duklar, at this point, no time through the pandemic has our governor, Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| Jacobs, or the Tennessee Department of Health mandated masks, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2550)|
| 0:42:37| That's incorrect. As far as Mayor Jacobs, Mayor Jacobs had a mask mandate, not for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| schools, but Mayor Jacobs had a mask mandate, or was it the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| County Board of Health had a mandate? Well, he lifted the mandate. I mean, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| know, so it was a county mandate, but as far as the statement with regard to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| governor and the Tennessee Department of Health, they've never mandated masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| Right. So, up until this point, it's been a local decision. I mean, I know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| had authorities, some authority to do that because of the emergency order, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| we, at no point did Knox County schools have to issue a mask mandate, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| correct? So, yes, I mean, I think you've stated it correctly, which is the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| of emergency allowed the board to mandate masks, which it did through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| policy. Yes. Okay, thank you. Ms. Owen. Thank you, Madam Chair. I've been fielding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| phone calls from confused families for quite a while, and I reached out at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| beginning of May and asked for some clarification about the word recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| because the recommendation from the CDC is a recommendation to us. They are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| recommending that all students have face coverings. They are recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| that people who are vaccinated wear face coverings, and so I had quite a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| discussion with senior staff about the word recommend, and at the time, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| website said optional, and that was not what we had voted on, and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| corrected, and I greatly appreciated that, but as we've gone on, what's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| on the website and what has come out has changed, even though the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| are changing in the opposite direction. So, what we've seen on the website went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| from recommended to optional, changed back to recommended, and the last thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2676)|
| 0:44:47| I saw on the website said allowed. Now, I know that's just semantics, but for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| families who are trying to determine whether their medically fragile students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| can be in our schools this year, there is a large difference between recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| and allowed. I think for our students who are determining whether they are to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| wear face masks, kids want to follow the rules. They want to know what the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| are, and if we can't tell them what the rules are, then that gives them issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| in following them, and when we're saying we recommend that you do something and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| then we say you're allowed to do something, that's just too different, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| my issue is not with face coverings. My issue is not with face coverings at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| My issue is that this board voted on language that was in an opening plan, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2739)|
| 0:45:47| that language said that we would follow the recommendations of the CDC and of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| state, and that those recommendations could change as we went along, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| information that's going out to the media is saying that we will not do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| for this year. Well, that doesn't say that we are going to adjust as necessary. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| says anything but we are going to adjust as necessary, so when we adopted language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| in April, and I think it's important to go back and look at April because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| what we agreed, and this board said here's what we're going to do. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| families don't understand why that's not what we're going to do, and I actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| had someone on my doorstep yesterday asking me for clarification of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| we're going to do, and I told the person what we voted in April, and he said I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| know what you voted in April. I want to know if you're going to do it, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| what I'm hearing from lots of people. They are confused. They don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| the difference in the information that's going out. They don't understand why the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| board has voted for something, and then the information coming from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| administration is different. If the guidelines were changing in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| direction, I think they would understand. If the guidelines from the CDC and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| state health department and local health department, if all of those guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| were moving in that direction, it would make sense, but when the guidelines are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| moving in the opposite direction, and when they see that the numbers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| moving in the opposite direction, they're very confused about what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| doing here, and I think we are we're in a pattern of going back and forth so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2858)|
| 0:47:47| much and not sticking to what we have voted on that the public has gotten to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| point where they expect us to go back and forth and not stick to what we voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| on, and that's extremely problematic for me, so I would like for our board to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| stick with what we voted on. We never changed that vote. We voted in April to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2884)|
| 0:48:12| accept the language in the plan, and that hasn't changed. The language in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| that we discussed in our meeting was following the recommendations of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| state, and those recommendations were specific to health. We've had a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| opinions from a lot of politicians and a lot of politicians making different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| kinds of threats and different kinds of pleas on all kinds of things. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| aren't what we agreed to follow. If they give us a directive, then we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| to follow that. Until then, we have what we said we would do, and I'm not sure how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2925)|
| 0:48:53| any other change impacts that, because we never changed that vote. We voted for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| opening plan. In May, when we started talking about rolling back the face mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| policy and ending it sooner, I also had discussions to determine exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2946)|
| 0:49:14| the administration was looking at doing, and at that time I suggested making our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| opening plan retroactive for two months so that it would cover the summer. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| didn't pass that. That still didn't change what we did vote for. This should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| have started August 1, so I'm really concerned that what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| voting for as a board is not what we are backing. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| Owen, Ms. Christie. Okay. Can I just say for the audience, it's going to be a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2988)|
| 0:49:57| night, I think, and if we can just let all of our board members speak, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| when we have public forum two, if we can just let people speak and not keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| interrupting, we can get through this meeting probably a lot faster. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you, Ms. Fab. Ms. Christie. And I really don't have a lot to say. I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| like I've said most of what I needed to make, and I would like for Mr. Dupler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| just to speak to the enforcement, because there was also a piece in his memo about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3018)|
| 0:50:25| questions about legally enforcing the mask, and also I'm looking at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| reopening plan, and that's attached to the April agenda, and there's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| something in there about moving schools to red, and we know that we can't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| now. So, I mean, there were other things in place that, I guess, in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| mind, this was related to the state of emergency we were under when we voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| and a lot of those permissions were taken away. Mr. Dupler. Thank you, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3052)|
| 0:51:03| Chair. Thank you, Ms. Christie. Ms. Christie, are you talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| fact that there's been question as far as the board's specific power to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| okay, okay. So, you know, there's been discussion about a case that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| came out of Williamson County, and that Williamson County case was already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| discussed by the board, and I talked about it as well at a board meeting, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| that case is not direct precedent. In other words, it doesn't directly affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| Knox County because it's out of Williamson County, so it directly affects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| Williamson County, and it was dismissed on technical grounds, so it didn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| directly affect Williamson County schools either, but it had some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| in there about whether or not local school boards have the authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| mandate masks, and the Chancellor had gone through and looked at numerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| state statutes that talk about the board's powers and was looking for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| specific statute because there's a rule in law called Dillon's Rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| that says that local school boards and local governments only have the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| that's granted to those entities by the state, so that's what the Chancellor was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| looking at and came to the conclusion that there was really only that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| general power that applied, which was the power to control the local education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3148)|
| 0:52:36| the schools, so based upon that, that's why the Chancellor came to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| conclusion that school boards don't have that power. Now again, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| direct law? No, it's not, but it's certainly something to show that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| in question as to whether or not this board should be passing a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| mandate at all, and it's also, another big part of our memo was focused on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| executive orders of the governor and the fact that, and I think I've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| mentioned it, was that the state of emergency has been lifted. Currently, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| only state of emergency exists with regard to the SNAP program and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| National and State Guard, so with all that together, our office's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3198)|
| 0:53:26| for the board would be not to institute a mask mandate, but ultimately it's up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| this board to decide. Thank you, Mr. Dupler. Ms. Owen, did you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| question directly to that? Mr. Watson, do you mind if she asks a question? Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Madam Chair, I do. In the judge's opinion, after the dismissal of the Williamson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3221)|
| 0:53:48| County case, was it that he found that the board did not have authority or did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| he not find anything to support the board having authority? It was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| understanding that he found neither that the board had the authority or that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| did not have the authority. Let me double check that and I'll get back to you. I know that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| lot of knots. Thank you. Okay, Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I do want to point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3252)|
| 0:54:20| out that I brought this issue up to Mr. Thomas and Mr. Dupler and Ms. Cayley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| prior to the CDC adjusting any other guidance. Again, my point in bringing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| up was directly related to the vote. My understanding from board policy is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| the majority of the board, a 5-4 vote, carries that vote. And Mr. Thomas, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| completely respect, again, your frustration, but the reason I'm bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| this up and talking about it, I would not be talking about this if that vote was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| 4-5. I'm talking about it because the vote was 5-4 and my understanding from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| policy is that the majority wins out in that vote. And so I went back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| looked at, I literally watched every video between the early April meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| and the late May meeting relative to these issues and there's much in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| that I highlighted that tried to track that. I'm certainly not going to bore the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| board with that, but there is one comment that I wanted to pull out and ask a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| question about. This is at the 5-12 meeting, so this is after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| governor first adjusted his state of emergency. Toward the end of that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| at 3-31, in that meeting, I talked about the majority vote, policy B-1-12, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| I would be passing on that mass change because of that reason. And then Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| Dupler, I asked you, I said, and this is verbatim, has there been anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| has been made of our vote on April 14th that would make it moot, Mr. Dupler? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| then you said, that is not an easy question because things have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| things have happened recently, but your question, has there been a legal mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| as I understand it, has there been something from a judge, something from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| the governor, something from the Tennessee Department of Health saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| that schools must remove masks? There has not been that, but there has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| consideration for this board to look at. It is not binding. And then I asked, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| asked at this point, if we let our votes regarding the following Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| Department of Health guidelines for 21-22, referencing the vote that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| on April the 14th, and then sunsetting the mask policy on August 1st stand, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| we acting outside of our authority legally? And you said, there is nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| legally at this point to restrict the board from following the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| Department of Health guidelines for the 21-22 year or from changing the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| And then at 3.40 in that meeting, and this is my last statement, Ms. Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| stated, so if this, stated if this is approved, meaning the sunsetting of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| policy that we were talking about at that time, the mask, the face covering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| does that mean we have no plan for summer school? And then Ms. Horne said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| Mr. Dupler, does that mean that there would be no face covering policy for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| summer? And Mr. Dupler said, as I, so as I understand it, is the superintendent has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| a plan for the fall, so you referenced he has a plan for that, and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| voted on, and if you sunset this policy, then Ms. Owens said, what Ms. Owen says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| is correct, there would be no plan and policy for, in effect, for the summer. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| if that is what, at that point, I know I voted under that guidance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3457)|
| 0:57:46| sunsetting the policy earlier because you had made several statements in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| those meetings to those, to that effect, that he has a plan for the fall, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| affects the summer. So I know you're saying that you looked in this in great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| detail recently when I asked these questions, but when Superintendent Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| referenced his plan, adjusted plan on 630, there had been no time from April 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3489)|
| 0:58:17| to 630 that the board had been told that the superintendent was not able to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| out the will of the board on that vote. Is that accurate? You have to restate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3503)|
| 0:58:33| question. So the question is, and I referenced at one example, that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| stated that there's nothing legally that would cause the vote on April 14th to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| moot, and then the next thing, that was the last meeting we had on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| and that was toward the end of that meeting. That was May the 12th, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| the next thing that the board and the community hears in response to COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| protocols from the superintendent was announced on June the 30th, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| was no discussion with the board related to that ahead of time. It was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| announced in the meeting. So what I'm asking is, is if the last guidance the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| board got when asked directly whether or not anything legally had changed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| make that moot, and the answer was no, and then the superintendent acted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| differently than what was approved on April the 14th, why was the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| not updated on that legal authority in those two months? Until I asked the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| question. So I'm looking back at the minutes from the May meeting, and what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3577)|
| 0:59:48| indicates is that there was nothing to offer legally about that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| either way at that time. Again, we can't take these things out of context because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| at that time there still was a limited state of emergency declared by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| governor. So, I mean, those statements were true at the time, and you know, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| that state of emergency has since been lifted, certainly with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| school systems. But the first question asked you this evening was, according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| your memo, you said that it was the action of the board that removed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| authority. So which was it? Is it both? Is it the state of emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| It is both, and you know, since you're making my memorandum, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| David Boots as well, the Knox County Law Directors, and you know, since you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| making that, you know, part of the agenda, then, I mean, everyone can see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| it's really a combination of all these things. I mean, you know, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| state action, it's, you know, the questions raised by that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| particular court and questions that may be raised by other courts, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| certainly is actions by this board as well. Thank you. Mr. Dupler, I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| appreciate you digging into it, and that's part of the reason for me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| bring this conversation, is because I think the public needs to hear this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| conversation, because as Ms. Owen stated, there is a lot of confusion. Some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| love the direction, some people hate the direction, and to me that's not the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| of either. It's they need to understand the direction, and if the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| is telling the superintendent and the school board that, hey, your authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| hasn't been adjusted, that needs to be made plainly clear to the public. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| that's, again, why I want the memo to be included in the agenda. Thank you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| you, Mr. Watson, and I'll point out, well, go ahead, Mr. Dupler. Madam Chair, I'm sorry. Ms. Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| had asked about the language from the Williamson County case, and to me, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| just best I have a copy of it, so I'll just read that section of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| It's just one sentence. The court cannot find, as a matter of law, defendants have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| acted within the authority given to them by the legislature when enacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| face-covering requirements. Okay, so they could not find that they had acted with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| authority, but they also did not state that they found they acted outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| their authority? It just says they could not confirm that they acted within their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| authority. The way I read that is that the chancellor was saying that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3738)|
| 1:02:25| could not find the authority, could not find it in the law. Thank you, and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3745)|
| 1:02:32| Watson, I would just add that you are asking Superintendent Thomas whether he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| was concerned about the guidance given to him by the board. On June 30, when he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| presented his plans to us, there were no questions or objections to that from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| this board, so I would assume that he felt like he had, that we were all on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| same page. I would assume, since there were no questions. Yeah, thank you, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| Horne. I appreciate you bringing that up. I actually referenced that when I spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| to, Mr. Thomas was out of town, but I emailed Mr. Thomas and Ms. Kelly and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| Dupler following that, and I said out of deference for him, I did not bring it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| that night because I didn't want to challenge him, not having been briefed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| it. Mr. Thomas and I often talk and I always try to help him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| understand where I'm going with my questions in advance, and I didn't bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| it up that night out of respect for him. Okay, but he also brought it up on July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| 14th and said the same thing, so I feel like we had several times when he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| informed us that we did not object. I appreciate that. I tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| really hard to handle this in private, and the last time that Mr. Dupler and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| Mr. Thomas and I met, which was late last week, in that conversation we had agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| to bring it to the agenda because of the confusion. Okay, thank you. Let's hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| Ms. Babb, please. Yeah, and I appreciate Ms. Owen and Mr. Watson's concerns, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3837)|
| 1:04:06| has been brought to my attention that maybe I have said things in April, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| what did I really mean in April, and I'm going to say right now, in April we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| under one circumstance, may we're in different circumstance, and times have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| changed, and what I think really when I look at things and I look at the crowd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| of people that are here and the emails that I've gotten, nobody is saying what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| did you mean on April 14th. What people are wanting to know right now is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| are we going with masks, and please don't start clapping when we're there, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| hooting or hollering, but I want to bring to it what people, I know what, why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| y'all are here, and I think this is where, I think, I hate to say it, I think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| getting very off track. People want to know we're starting school next week, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Mr. Thomas has come out with the plan, and now people are questioning it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| wanting to know if it's going to change, and what people need to understand is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| there are a lot of different forces that are coming into this. There is not one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3898)|

| 1:05:23| out with mask mandates, so if we're going to go back to the Health Department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| Tennessee Health Department, they're not mandating them. We're also getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| different guidance from our local health board, we're getting different guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3931)|

| 1:05:43| really don't care about our meeting in April. As much as y'all want to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| about it, I don't care anymore. I really don't. I want to care about what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| the people here are wanting to talk about, which is how are we starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3950)|
| 1:05:54| school, and we're not making a vote tonight, but I will say I don't think, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| don't see this personally as the time for mandates, but where I do see things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| is I want to strongly recommend people to wear masks, especially if they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| like they should, and people should feel comfortable wearing a mask, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| a teacher or a student, and I do want the language to change in that way, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| is one thing Ms. Owen was talking about. I think we need to be very strong in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| that language. We see that people are recommending it. Physicians group are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| recommending it. CDC, different groups are doing it. They're recommending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| Mandates, I just don't see holding a lot of weight in our community, and so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| would have a hard time being behind a mandate, but I do want our language from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| Knox County Schools to be we highly recommend it. We highly support anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4001)|

| 1:06:53| people would get their damn vaccine, because honestly, that's why our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4013)|

| 1:07:03| again, that's what eats me up at night, is the fact that if people back in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| had gone and gotten their vaccination, we wouldn't be having their conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| right now, and there are going to be people that disagree with that, but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| still the majority of people would have done it, we'd be in a different place, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| so anyway, I'm going to leave it at that, but that's my opinion. Thank you, Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| We're going to go to, I think Ms. Owens was on next. Thank you, Madam Chair. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| think the place where we are off track is in not hearing what the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4051)|
| 1:07:39| actually is. This isn't an issue about what our guidelines are. This is an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4059)|
| 1:07:47| of our board voting, and that vote not matter. This is an issue of whether we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4067)|
| 1:07:56| are going to vote and stand by it, or whether we're going to vote and do what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4076)|
| 1:08:03| we have seen boards a long time ago do. Just go back and say, that's all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4083)|
| 1:08:11| never mind, we didn't really, that's, we've literally seen superintendents, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| recent superintendents, let me be very clear, but we have seen superintendents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| long ago literally do something illegal, and the board come back and retroactively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4103)|
| 1:08:32| vote and make it all okay. If we aren't going to stand by what we vote to do, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| we aren't going to say we voted and then stand by it, then we're headed down that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4119)|
| 1:08:47| same path, and I know that many of us are here because we knew that path was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4127)|
| 1:08:55| very wrong path. This isn't about mandates. I don't think anybody has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4135)|
| 1:09:04| we need to mandate anything. I don't see any proposal on our agenda that suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| mandating anything. What I see is a question of why what we voted on isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4150)|
| 1:09:22| being carried through, and if what we voted on couldn't be carried through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| either we should have been told that then, or we should have been told that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| a subsequent meeting so that we could make an adjustment, but that never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| happened. We voted to give the superintendent the authority to consult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4177)|
| 1:09:46| with whomever he needs to at the state health department, the CDC, or local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| health authorities, I believe we're also in there, to make decisions as the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| goes along. That's what we voted on. That's the language that should be out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| there, but when we say we are definitely not doing this for the whole year, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4203)|
| 1:10:10| not the same thing as what we voted on. It doesn't matter what it was. It doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| matter if we voted to wear pink shoes. It doesn't matter, but what we voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| needs to be what we stand by, especially when we have never voted otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| That's the only thing that I'm asking. I think it's the only thing Mr. Watson's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| asking, is that we want the board's vote to matter, because if it doesn't, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| no reason for us. Thank you, Ms. Irwin. Mr. McMillan. Thank you, Madam Chair. I had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4241)|
| 1:10:50| comment about Ms. Babs' remarks, but since Ms. Owen said what she said, I would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4250)|
| 1:11:02| like to know, what do you want to do? You said you all didn't want to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| math. Well, these people are here because they want to talk about math. Do you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| if it's optional, now the superintendent can talk to anybody he wants to, confer with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4275)|
| 1:11:22| any state person or national person for that matter, that doesn't mean that he has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4282)|
| 1:11:30| authority to, or he desires to carry through with whatever they tell him. Do you agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4290)|
| 1:11:40| with that? What I agree with is the language that we voted on. What language is that? That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| what I want to know. It's the language that we have written multiple times, and I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| to answer your question when you stop yelling at me. Okay, answer it. The language was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| follow the recommendations of the CDC, and that state guidance would override that. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4316)|
| 1:12:05| the language that we voted on. Now, the recommendations of the CDC may change, and we all know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| and we discussed that. So if we say that we're going to follow recommendations, we have given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| our superintendent the latitude to make adjustments that he needs to. Maybe the situation gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4338)|
| 1:12:26| a lot worse. Maybe the situation gets a lot better. But we voted to give him the latitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| to do what needs to be done, just like we do with weather, just like we do with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| flu. We voted that our superintendent could adjust that as we go along. But the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| that has come out to the press is that we are doing specific this for the whole year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4364)|
| 1:12:52| which is not what we voted. We voted for our superintendent to have the latitude to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| those adjustments as we go along. But if you're going to sink or swim with the CDC, in case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4377)|
| 1:13:04| you haven't noticed, they bounce like a rubber ball. There's a lot of disagreement about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| them. If I'm going to swim with a rubber ball, then I'm probably going to have a good chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| If you want to believe in that, whatever you want to believe in. But right now, as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4397)|

| 1:13:46| if they wish to wear a mask to school, they can wear it. If they don't want to, they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4426)|
| 1:13:53| have to because there's not a mandate. We're not even talking about masks. We're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| about following the vote that we took. That's all that matters. So you're more worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| the vote we took four months ago than you are us opening school. I'm worried about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4443)|

| 1:14:19| about this board's authority and whether we have any. Because what I'm seeing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4459)|
| 1:14:28| we don't. Because the vote that we took is not being upheld. So you're worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| credibility? Yes. I'm worried about the credibility of this body. And I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4476)|

| 1:17:27| honest, once again, I don't really care what one doctor's opinion is. I think it's, once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| again, this is where, you know, it's, I think we're having differing opinions from authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| and I think as a school board, we can totally support what people feel like is right for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| their children to do. And for a lot of those parents, it would be wearing a mask. For some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| of those parents, it's not wearing a mask. As we all saw in our emails, it's very split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| So it's not for me as a, it's not for me to decide what your child is most comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| with. I don't, I can't tell if a child is comfortable with a mask on, and I don't, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| know, I don't think that's in my purview to sort of dictate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| Nor for me to decide, but since you made the comment about you wanted people to be comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4684)|
| 1:18:13| with a mask, I thought you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| I want them to feel comfortable that they're not ridiculed, that they're not made fun of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| That's what I mean about comfortable, like that they're not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Okay, well that wasn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| I think we have got to respect what's going on in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| I thought you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| I thought you were talking about physically comfortable. And, you know, we can sit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4707)|
| 1:18:34| and argue and talk for, you know, three hours, but the way it sits right now, people could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4714)|
| 1:18:43| wear, if you want your child to wear a mask, let them wear a mask. If you want your child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4723)|
| 1:18:50| not to, then so be it. The parent could decide. From all the information I can read, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4730)|
| 1:18:58| say that the younger kids, that the masks do not do any good on them, that they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4738)|
| 1:19:07| they suffer more. A lot of doctors think, or medical people think they suffer more from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| trying to be forced to wear a mask in, you know, in a classroom than they would with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4754)|
| 1:19:21| whatever exposure they get. That's all I wanted to say, was just that, why can't we just decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| to open school and let them have a choice and forget about all this and who was right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| and who was wrong. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Thank you, Mr. McMillan. I would agree. I think the timing on this conversation is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| good timing because the staff needs to get school open. Parents need to worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| getting their students ready to go back to school. If we need to have a procedural meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| we can add that to our work session in September for our retreat. I think we need to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| on, if anybody watched the, if anybody's paying attention to the T and Ready scores, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| to be focusing on academics. So I would, I would suggest that that be what we focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| and that we come back to a procedural issue if we have, if we have a problem. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4807)|
| 1:20:14| would be my suggestion. I would agree with the board members who have said that parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| have full authority to ask their child to wear a mask when they go to school if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| choose to. And I, I feel like our principals and our teachers are professionals and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4823)|
| 1:20:29| will do a great job encouraging students to wear a mask if they feel like they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| I have full assurance that our educators are professional enough to, to do that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| their classrooms and in their schools. I have no doubt. So that would be my, my comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| and we'll go to Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. This will be my last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| comment on, on this matter. I do appreciate your comments around the procedural nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| of this. To Ms. Owens' point about simply trying to understand the impact of a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| for the board, as an example, if you take item A on this agenda, which talks about increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| salary at 4% for custodial educational assistant school secretaries, my guess is that vote's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| probably going to approve next week. I obviously can't tell the future on that, but let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| it does get approved and then we find out in three months that the superintendent actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| gave a $2,000 bonus instead of a $1,000 bonus to each person. My guess is there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| other people on this board that would have some concern about that. Not that we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| want to give more money, but because it didn't seem to follow the vote that we made. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| so what I would ask, from what I understand from the law department, is things have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| but what I am very clear about is that the board has not been updated about those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| proactively relative to that vote. And I would ask in the future, as a voting member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| of this body, that any vote that we make that says we're going to take a certain action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| if things change that impact that vote, I would ask the law department and or the central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| administration to let the board know proactively what those changes are. Again, this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4929)|
| 1:22:16| an item that I wanted to bring up. I spoke quite a bit in the spring about how many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| we had talked about this particular item, and I can tell you the reason why I voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| in April and in May the way that I did is so we didn't continue to bring this up. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| as I told Mr. Dupler and Mr. Thomas earlier this week, if the superintendent and or board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| truly does not have authority in this matter, then I would drop it. But that was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| that was not known to me until I asked the question two and a half months after the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| So I would ask in the future that we're proactively notified if the implications of our vote and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| the situations and the relative authority change, that we're made aware of that. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| we shouldn't have to ask for that information. I can't ask if my authority has changed unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4979)|
| 1:23:06| the people who know about the situations related to that authority make it known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4986)|
| 1:23:13| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Mr. Thomas? Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. I'd just like to say a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| words here of what I've heard from the standpoint. You know, basically making me feel like my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| integrity is being questioned in terms of carrying out the will of the board. And I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| spent not in this position 48 years, but 48 years in this school district trying to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| out the will of the board, trying to help our employees, trying to improve the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| for our employees, trying to provide the very best educational opportunities for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| We went to summer school in the month of June, part of July. We operated under what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| operating under right now, and there was not one single question about it. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| I'm a little bit confused about where I have not complied with what the board wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| do. And, you know, quite frankly, I resent that. A person doesn't have much but their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| integrity. So, you know, I guess I just don't understand that because you, the board, approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5051)|
| 1:24:19| any guidance issued by the state would take precedence. Does that not tell me I have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| latitude if it changes, that we change the plan? You know, and I should have been questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5063)|
| 1:24:31| And I apologize to Mr. Watson for not putting in a board update what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| But, you know, I find this quite upsetting. So you just need to know that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5076)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you, Mr. Superintendent. Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Superintendent, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| just wanted to address that, and I respect that. I mean, in all the conversations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| we've had, correct me if I'm wrong, I've mentioned to you that this, for me, is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| about you and the actions that you've taken. You admitted to me earlier today when we spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| that you have also been confused through this process. And I don't fault you for that. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| confused. There's been a number of different votes. There's been a number of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| actions. There's been a number of different stakeholders, including the governor and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| mayor and all those types of things that have weighed in. I don't think you acted outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| of what you knew to be the appropriate action. All I'm asking for is that as the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5126)|
| 1:25:34| and or administration understands that the board and or the superintendent's authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| has shifted, that we just be made known that. I've not seen that ever happen on this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| in the year that I've served so far. I don't think it's a precedent. And I appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| and as I told you before, appreciate you making note of that in terms of letting us know before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| that. And, you know, Superintendent Thomas, I never have privately, and I'm not publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| questioning your integrity. I'm simply asking for a little bit more communication as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| authority of the board and or superintendent adjusts. So I respect you too much to question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5170)|
| 1:26:17| your authority or your integrity. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Watson. Ms. Owen. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| Madam Chair. I agree, Mr. Watson and Mr. Thomas. Your integrity is exactly why this is confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5184)|
| 1:26:32| for us because my goal was to find out where this is being changed, what is going on that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5192)|
| 1:26:42| causing us to not have the information that we need and not be able to get it. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| a question of your integrity. I'm questioning the integrity and the future integrity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5208)|
| 1:26:56| this board. It is not a question of yours. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Owen. Mr. Dupley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5216)|
| 1:27:05| would you like to weigh in? Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. I feel like we need to on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| of our office because I think Ms. Babs said it best, which is COVID has been an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| which has been ever evolving since March of 2020. And, you know, things have changed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5237)|
| 1:27:24| there's been a lot of moving parts from many different forms of government, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| national, state, local or otherwise. So, you know, it's been hard to get a handle on. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5249)|
| 1:27:36| if anybody's been confused, then, you know, a lot of people have been confused. And frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| we do appreciate Mr. Watson asking us to do this memo because it did give us a chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| take a good research look at the situation and give the best response possible. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5267)|
| 1:27:55| Thank you, Mr. Dupler. Okay, we have one final topic on our agenda and that is the framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| for the ESSER 3.0 application to the Department of Education. Mr. Thomas, would you like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5281)|
| 1:28:08| talk about that first or should we? No, Dr. Reiswick's prepared to go through the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| for you, but I'd just like to say before John does that, that I want to express my appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| to John and his team and Jill Martin. They have worked extremely hard to get all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| information together and they've done it under circumstances that are not the most ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| in the timeline that we've been asked to do all this. So John and his team have done an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| excellent job. The board did have an opportunity to hear from Ford last week and as Ms. Babb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| mentioned, it was one of the most refreshing conversations that we've had in some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| If you can't get excited about what we talked about last week, I just don't believe you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| can get excited. So John, if it's okay, Madam Chair, just turn it over to Dr. Reiswick and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| dazzle us with your efforts to spend $114 million and to provide opportunities for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| students to get them caught up. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. For the board members who've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| heard this, it's not dazzling. They may be asleep before it's over. So I do want to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| what Mr. Thomas said and he's been part of this process as well and pretty much everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| here you see from Knox County Schools has been part of that, either on a committee or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| a subcommittee. As he did, as he also mentioned, the timeline has been very tight with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5367)|
| 1:29:32| and kind of the guidance we've gotten from the state throughout the process. And they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| only doing as well as they can to get information from the feds and we understand that the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| government is trying to get this money out as quick as they can to schools to make an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| impact. And Ms. Horne alluded to earlier, you know, I know the data is still under embargo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| but our kind of first look at the data of the impact of the pandemic is definitely something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| that we want to get these things into effect as quick as we can. So I will try to go quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| but also try to be somewhat thorough to help explain kind of where we are with this. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| and Dr. Reiswick, I'll just let the public know and anyone watching that this is attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| to the agenda. So if you want to look at it at home or at your table, it is attached to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| the agenda also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. So I'll start just with this. As you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| all know, and I think Mr. Watson alluded to earlier in the meeting today, there is a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| robust stakeholder process for this to take place. And so I'll get into some of that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5424)|
| 1:30:30| a minute, but I wanted to also speak to Laura Ancalade, who was one of our facilitators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| who works with NIET who came in and was a third party who helped with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| When we thought about what was required from the state and the feds to get the level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| stakeholder engagement that was required, we really didn't have that expertise with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| school getting ready to start and coming out of the pandemic. So we did have someone from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| the outside come and help with that process. And we'll talk through some of that in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| but also just wanted to talk about how we got to this statement. Laura, besides just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| working with communities and stakeholder input, she also worked with our executive team. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| she was bringing stakeholder information as it was still open and coming to us. Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| Martin, who again gets a lot of credit as our federal programs director, was working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| through the state side of certain documents and questions that we had to answer around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| a needs assessment, as well as the rest of us. So bringing both of those documents together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| she spent two sessions with the district's executive team. And as we kind of did a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| through with her, these were the things that really came out to us from looking at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| documents. So again, you can read, but I'll read this one to you. Knox County will strategically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| use the ESSER 3.0 funds so that all students across all schools and all student groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| will have access to the continued support and tools needed to thrive in grade level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| instruction and to enable them for success post-graduation. And you know, that is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5509)|
| 1:31:55| for us. That's been important for us the last couple of years to not just think about getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| kids across the line for graduation, but are they prepared for that life after. I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| this said the other day, and I like the way it was said, to enroll, enlist, or be employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| Those are all acceptable for us if they're ready to do those things. So that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| Oops, wrong way. Okay. So I think the other part of this, the ESSER funds will provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| us an opportunity to accelerate our progress in alignment with our strategic mission. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| again, the superintendent has spoken to this. You'll see that come through in this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| I want to take a second and kind of talk about some points of emphasis that we've heard this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| week and kind of thinking through things as we go into this plan. The first is one actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| Commissioner Swinn said in a webinar we did this week. And I really like this, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| it's important as you frame your thinking around this, but she said you cannot outwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| a pandemic. And that was evident from what we have seen. And I think this is a good perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| for us as data will start becoming public and we think about that. So the 2021 student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| achievement data that we're going to receive is going to show a decline. We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| It's pretty much across the board. It's the same for the state, the same for what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| going to see in Knox County. So we want to just be clear just in stating this, that these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| data are not a reflection of the effort of our teachers or our school leaders. Instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| it's a reflection of the disruption that students face throughout the year and the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| And just wanted to lay out what some of those were just so everybody kind of grasped that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| Typically, we look at data and we start trying to do this kind of deep dive into root cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| and figure those kinds of things out. We'll continue to do that, but we also want to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| a lot of this was around student absenteeism this year. And some of that was around sickness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| and some of that was around quarantine. When you think about if you're a student, even a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| student who achieves well, and you're in a class for the beginning of a concept, a math concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| and then you're disrupted for 10 days while the teacher's continuing to go on. And you may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| have two days to get on virtual and kind of try to figure that out, but not be able to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| questions. So even high-functioning students who have always done well really struggle with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| Students who've had at-risk behaviors and at-risk academic performance, they're going to challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| or challenged even more in that. So that's not an effort issue. That's not a student, family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| or teacher effort issue. That's just what, you know, the things that are caused by the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| We saw the same with teachers. You know, a teacher's teaching has their lesson plans laid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| out for 10 days and all of a sudden it's disrupted for a positive COVID test. And now I have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| home. I have to try to figure out how to get onto my class through Canvas and log that even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| we did training, even though we did those kinds of things, it's still not the same. Periodic school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| closures, we saw that happen this year even in our district. We were able to stay open with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| Thomas's leadership, but at the same time there were some schools that closed in that. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| also the learning curve of virtual. I mean, our teachers did a great job embracing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| but there were a lot of new apps and a lot of new tools and we got intuitive and a lot smarter at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| that. And our spring was better than our fall, but all those, again, are challenges when we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| about that you can't outwork a pandemic. It wasn't for lack of effort and we just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| that that's clear. We also know in the second part at a minimum, and I think this is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| for us to state, prediction would be three to five years before we may get back to where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5701)|
| 1:35:08| were pre-COVID. Now we hope that's not the case and we really do. And that's going to lead to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| Shannon Jackson said this this week and I thought this was good, the third point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| the KCS has to have a sense of urgency to teach, lead, and support students like our hair's on fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| for the next five years. And I think that's totally true. And that was something as we talked about an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| exec team and she said that well. So, you know, it may not bear out and it's going to be hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| compare 18-19 data with the data we're going to see. And it's going to be hard to compare next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| year's data with, you know, I think this is a good thought too. Right now everyone's expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| we're going to see this data and we're going to kind of go, okay, we had a pandemic last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| Well, next year the numbers may not be, I mean, they may be better improving and moving in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| way, but they may not be back to where they were. But we won't hopefully have the urgency around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| coming into a pandemic and it's easy to forget when you get out from there that some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| impact on kids who might be in the second grade and they may still be feeling some of these effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| by fourth grade. So we just have to know it's a long game to get there, but we will get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| for sure. So just want to set that up. Whoops, wrong way again. And then this is just what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| believe. We do think our staff, our teachers, leaders, parents of Knox County have the heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| and determination to get this job done and we do realize that our students' future depends on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| So we're excited about it. So I say all that to say as we get into this plan, there's a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| things we'll look at. First is we know with these dollars we have to focus both on immediate needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5787)|
| 1:36:33| which are the next 12 to 24 months, but we also need to look at the next three to five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| because $114 million doesn't come every year. You know, that's kind of decades you might get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| that kind of money at a given time. So trying to balance, and I'm going to show some places where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| that's happened, we'll go into more strategies in a second, but we try to balance this across both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| When you look at some of our strategies, and again I'll go into more detail where these fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| in our priorities in a second, but some immediate strategies we have in this plan you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| see some tutoring models that will impact students. We hope, I say immediately, it may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| more spring of 2022 because there's a recruitment and training process that has to happen for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| but we think that's a more immediate reaction to the gaps. Creating transition programs for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| sixth grade and ninth graders. We've done some things called summer bridge and that sort of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| so that students have additional time in summer to do catch-up. That's an immediate response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| You'll see a lot of things in this plan about better data tracking. We do that now, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| haven't been able to be as intentional about that and know what sources we're looking at to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| those decisions. There's a lot of this will be built on capacity building in the school to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| able to make those day-to-day instructional decisions as teachers and coaches work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| that. And then also offer incentives for teachers to utilize planning periods to support students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| and, oops, sorry that was in the wrong place. That's actually one of our tutoring strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| I'll talk about that in a second. So long-term strategies are also in this. We're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| growing reading specialists, another strategy we're excited about. That may take 12 to 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| to do, so that's something that may be yield, we think, past the five years, but it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| that we could do, again, that's not going to happen immediately. Our Grow Your Own program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| looking at expanding that to like a historic black college or university, that's a strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| that, again, we won't yield that fruit in the first semester of that. Develop fast-track paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| for effective math tutors to become math teachers, and we think we can build a system out for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| but they may be a year three strategy in these ESSER dollars. And then also one is to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| CTE programming pathways at every school that could be community-based to serve, community-facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| to serve the community in which they exist. So those are just some examples of, you'll see some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| intermediate, I mean some immediate and some long-term focus on those. We also have a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5917)|
| 1:38:44| balance in our strategies, we think, on everything being research-based, but we also don't have all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| the answers. It's not just follow all these steps and you'll get there. There's space for innovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| in these strategies, and we really believe we have the school leaders and teachers to help us figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| this out. So some examples of our research-based strategy, high dosage tutoring is one that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| really probably the best known strategy right now that most of the country is looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| Train and support reading specialists, as we mentioned before. Provide students with mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| health supports. Monitor student course taking and strengthen their CTE offerings and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| schedules as they go through their career with us. Creation of dashboards for effective decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| making and communication with families. Those are all very much research-based, but within those we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| see some space for innovation. As I said before, three different models of tutoring. We're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| to follow those with the REA team, see which ones are yielding the most fruit, and the great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| thing about these three years is it can be rewritten or revised as we go along. So if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| are things we see to be higher yield strategies, there are things we can scale up. If ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| aren't bearing fruit, we can shut those down and move forward. So create new strategies for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| teacher pipeline, additional intervention materials, we're talking about in some areas for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| an expansion of teacher leadership roles. These are all things we think we don't have fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| defined, but we think we'll be able to define those as we move forward. So just giving you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| on the overview as you look into it. So the ESSER planning process, I'm going to give you, I'll try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| to run through this quick and I won't read all the bullet points. If you look at that third bullet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| point, that's speaking to the overall dollars awarded through ESSER 3.0, just roughly over 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6011)|
| 1:40:17| million, but the truth is when you look at the bullet points under that, a million of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| dollars go to our Charter School Emerald Academy. 14.3 million of those dollars will come off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| top as indirect costs. That's common in a grant that there's a direct indirect cost amount. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| goes into our general purpose budget, and I know Ron can speak more to that, but typically that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| in there. We know some of these things, we try to build some dollars up in reserves for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| when these dollars go away and use it for some other projects like that. So if you're asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| you know that the real spend on this is about 98.7 million. That's still a whole lot of money. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| not 114, but just so you know where that's at. And then these funds have to be exhausted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| September 24th, which is different of, excuse me, September of 2024, which is different than they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| have to be allocated. They have to actually be spent by then. So that's another thing. So as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6061)|
| 1:41:07| Thomas spoke, there's a lot of parameters around this, that being one of those as opposed to being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| enough to see if we can stretch this further and further. We do have a an end date when that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| as far as we can go. Okay, so some specific requirements that the district has to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6075)|
| 1:41:24| when allocating this money. We're required to use at least 20 percent of that to address learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| loss. There are additional pieces the state has kind of incentivized to be able to use up to 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| percent of that for learning loss. And some of those things by doing that would be some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| tutoring programs the state has. There's some other planning support, some ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| implementation supports. Let me say this, like we think the state has a good plan. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| understand we're the third largest district in the state. So there are some places where we are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| in conversation with the state that we're not, we haven't just accepted everything that fits us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| we're going to take it. So there are some like around tutoring that have some different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| restrictions on that based on the ratios and that sort of thing. And we're not sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| can realistically cover all that. So we have some calls still ongoing with the state department to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| make sure that we still are eligible for some of those things. But it shouldn't impact us that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| Okay, just again some other housekeeping stuff. It's due by August the 27th, the final plan. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| tonight what you'll be looking at is our framework for how we're going to spend this or how we plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| to spend this. It won't have an exact budget with it because Cheryl and her team still have two more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| weeks to get the to kind of get in final format for what the state wants through an e-plan format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| that we have to submit to. But we will be bringing that back to the board once it's been applied with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| it with a full budget in. So what you'll see today when we go through the different priorities is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6164)|
| 1:42:49| we'll have a dollar amount allocated there. It may be 500,000 more or more or less, but it'll give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| you the general idea of what that is. It does talk about ESSER plans having meaningful public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| consultation and there was a lot of that. I'll show you a shot of that in a second so you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| see what that is, how that process worked. And then I'm actually going to show you that first. So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| is what it looked like. So our stakeholder engagement, these were the opportunities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| again Laura led this workforce from the outside. There was a stakeholder survey and I'll speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| that in a second about how many recipients we had for that or how many participants we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| Principal advisory was our principal focus group. We had an elementary teacher focus group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| secondary. We had a family advisory council. We had two community meetings that were open for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| everyone to attend, Sarah Simpson. And then we had the district needs assessment planning sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| there. And then I think Laura was able to meet with most of you on one-on-one meetings kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| to run through that information as well. So I think a pretty robust process for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| So some input on the stakeholder survey. So there were almost 14,000 of those surveys that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| completed or that were open. About 10,000 were totally completed. So that what that might mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| is someone may have only filled out a section of those other 3,000 in the difference. On the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| participant profile this kind of gives you a breakdown of who, how people identify themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| who completed the survey. You could be in more than one group so you could be a family member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| and also a teacher so that's why those don't add up to 100%. But that gives you an idea of who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| filled out the survey that was part of that. I'm going to go back now and kind of say so how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| get to the ESSER plan. So we take all of that student and again Laura helped do this which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| nice having a third party involved in that. So we take the stakeholder engagement then that needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| assessment that we talked about is really aligned to questions that the state set up on data. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| the questions were things like how many students were in virtual training, how many were virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| last year, how many were in person, how many like they'll ask us a lot of those kinds of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| that drive the data for us to form this needs assessment. Then once we had that we're able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| take some data that we had and kind of dive down into root causes and when we had those root causes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| we went back with the stakeholder information and again Laura was instrumental in doing this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| paired those up to kind of come up with what bubble to the top is priorities that would fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| in both of those. I will say this there were some good ideas from the stakeholders that just aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6307)|
| 1:45:13| allowable in ESSER so we were aware of that. I mean we had lots of good conversations around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| some things that might be stuff we'd consider for general purpose or a grant or something in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| future. They're just not allowable based on they had to be kind of caused by COVID and so some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| those questions we would have I remember sitting in a group that I facilitated at one of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| meetings and someone shared something for about 20 minutes and at the end of that I said well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| was that you know caused by COVID and they're like no but I still want to spend the money. I get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| I mean that's a great idea we wrote the idea down put it in there but it probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| wouldn't be allowable in ESSER. All right I'm going to skip to here. These were some of the trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6341)|
| 1:45:48| from the participants around the state priorities so the state kind of blocked it into four different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| or some different priorities and these were kind of what we heard around these areas that was kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| of what kind of the lead parts. Under academics and again I think you'll see a lot of this when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| we talk about our strategies additional tutoring programs interventionists to work with students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| early reading trainings and supports the need for a clear set of instructional priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| Interesting that that bubbled up because we sent some of that to student readiness the mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| supports not a surprise a lot around additional high school and middle school supports and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6376)|

| 1:46:24| but I think you heard from the Ford their their involvement with the community focus groups that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| was something to bubble up to so hearing that again. Educators around that again that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6389)|

| 1:46:40| educators and so class size reduction was one that was high up there. Support for new teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6400)|

| 1:47:13| 250 teachers you have to lay off in three years and and as those conversations happened in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| focus groups because she took the information from the survey to have that a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| were like you know that's not what we want to do a lot of families so I think people understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| there's a trade-off in some of that as you make those decisions. On foundational elements again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| it's talking more about technology investments we heard a lot around that making sure we continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| to have classrooms that have technology we've kind of turned the corner now where we do a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| of technology with the chromebooks and that sort of thing so we need to do that and also to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| sure our schools are healthy places to be. Here's some other things that came up that weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| necessarily that kind of came out of the conversations which we like and we're embracing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| too so one was frequent progress reports on data and impact on on needed changes. It's funny that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| Miss Satterfield brought that up around four today too so she was right in line with what we heard in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6478)|

| 1:48:08| dashboards or data check database decision making our ultimate goal is we don't want to just be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6488)|

| 1:48:18| that the leaders and the teachers can make those decisions and and drive that on a day-to-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| decision making that's where we want to be we'll be supports to that so so there'll be some training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| for that as well. Equity across resources and programming something else that we heard a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6507)|
| 1:48:33| and then ongoing stakeholder engagement. I mean this was kind of a neat thing for us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| and I know Mr. Thomas and I were talking last week walking back over like we may have found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| some process that kind of works you know we got good input from the Ford side and from the ESSER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| side and I think we heard that from the community that was the kind that was a good kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| engagement that they liked and obviously we can't do that every month on everything but maybe on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| some big kind of strategic stuff there may be a way to work with somebody to do some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| things so something we'll continue to try to do. Stakeholders aligned and this is across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| so when we talk about this Laura did a breakdown based on kind of all those that we saw from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| teachers to to parents to all those kinds of things these these kind of align again if you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| see these in the priorities all this information going to the top. Elementary focus was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| around K-2 literacy that's where we make the difference before third grade and the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| has seemed to have a higher negative effect on reading for those primary grades and we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| that's critical that's a huge concern of ours moving forward because it already was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| we were trying to work on with roughly 40 percent of our district proficient by third grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| and we'll probably see a step back for a little while that's a concern for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| Middle school math that 6-3 space. Algebra 1 really is kind of a gateway to push to say you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| going to be ready for life after graduation and that we we understand we need to do more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6585)|
| 1:49:52| backward planning in that 6-9 area. Typically kids who take algebra in 7th and 8th grade are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6592)|
| 1:49:58| usually you know in better shape academically but it's really those freshmen who take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| that sometimes we see that they may struggle to take higher math which is kind of a gateway to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| lot of opportunities and also shows us sometimes some deficits in some other areas but math will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| be our primary focus there and then high school triaging our rising junior and seniors to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6610)|

| 1:50:25| be good but she could her kids could be behind on credits there we understand that so that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| to be something that we need to continue to focus on and provide opportunities for schools to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| able to do what they need to do and then all grade levels the non-academic supports that we know are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| important for students to be able to learn and and again we continue to talk about it in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| frame we know there are obstacles to learning and sometimes they're social emotional or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| social economic those things we need to address those so that kids can be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| we continue to believe that that the way out of a lot of tough situations is is a better education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6651)|
| 1:51:00| so that's important for us all right so here were the priorities I'll run through these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| you all probably don't believe me I said I'll run through them quick you heard them this week and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6665)|

| 1:51:12| earlier there's a lot yeah there is a lot and and so let me say this I'm glad that so we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6672)|

| 1:51:28| the board right but we understand everything we try to think about is it's only as good as it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| be implemented at the school and that's how much can that school leadership handle and how much can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6692)|

| 1:51:58| that's too much and we'll need to adjust and do that but we've really tried to be coherent and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| aligned to what we're asking them to do because we know it's only as much as they can do in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6722)|

| 1:52:16| roughly 15 million over three years here I'm going to try to hit the high points one is we saw whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| we need clear instructional and proficiency outcomes so we would want to set those up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6741)|

| 1:55:25| with so extending the day or the year is probably not an option for those families and we hear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| so the other option is you maximize the time in the classroom on task so we would assign a tutor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| we would have the tutors trained in kind of the the core things the core interventions they might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| need for early literacy that'll allow the teacher in that classroom again that the data has shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| these to have the majority of students that need that kind of intervention for that class period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| to either do a small group pull out for those kids around a certain skill or vice versa they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| could handle some of the large group while the teacher does some intervention in a smaller group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| so very targeted again based on the data that we'll be using for that those those tutors could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| move from school to school as schools improve in those but again we do know we have schools with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| higher needs that may need that and some schools may be fine and make this on make this come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| of this in a lot faster situations that's our elementary tutoring model and then we have on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| the next one really trying to professional development and looking at some assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| as you know it's hard to tell if you're making progress in real time if you just wait for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| end of the year to get that test result so there are three things that three types of assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| we'll be looking at across the board k through 12. One is aims web that we've already been using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| for foundational skills in literacy we'll continue to teach principals and teachers how to use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=6997)|
| 1:56:44| data to make day-to-day instructional materials we're excited about case 21 our principals are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| excited as well that's a form of assessment that we'll give three times a year that we'll be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| to predict students proficiency rates it also has a pretty tight correlation right now to things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| act prediction and that sort of stuff post high school our goal again is this is we could pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7017)|
| 1:57:03| it at the district level to see where we're seeing trends and grade levels that need supports and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| that could become part of our district learning day trainings and our teaching and learning day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| trainings but really the power for that's going to be the schools and the teachers to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| look at that and kind of see because sometimes having taught myself you see sometimes you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| this was covered and kids mastered it you realize they don't and you have to go back and reteach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| that so right now we don't have a tool for them to see that kind of in real time and share that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| with their peers and then the third we do have some that are specific assessments that are aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| with our new benchmark advanced ela curriculum and some other curriculum that we have as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| that we continue to do that so if schools are using more beyond that we're fine with that some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| some are really have certain ones that they've been using as part of their school culture we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| fine with that but as far as the district we're really going to try to support those three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| pieces of data so that we can make instructional decisions day to day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| all right the next one i'll go through even faster i promise is really very similar but this one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| more the math focus for middle school so you're going to see some redundant strategies here i'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| call out some of the different ones the first one's back to the walkthrough tool to really look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| at what we need in sixth grade seventh grade eighth grade math and being intentional about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| that so sixth grade math looks the same at gresham middle school as it does at farragut middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| like we have those same kind of ideas of what we're trying to do if again our ultimate goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| back to the ford conversation last week is to produce this kind of graduate across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| no matter zip code or any other factors then we're going to have to get some some figured out how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| do those across the board and provide the supports in different places so i think this helps us do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| that i'm going to move down to strategic deployment of resources because this is going to show it the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7113)|
| 1:58:38| let's see which one of that fourth bullet now yeah that's going to show what our middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| tutoring model would be this one's a little different our goal in this one would be to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| 100 tutors and deploy six of those to every middle school so that schools could look at their math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7126)|
| 1:58:53| outcomes and then the principal could assign based on that again we train them in basic math strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| and how that how they could go about doing that so this would be one we feel like there's enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| need across the board in our middle schools and the size of schools at different places that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| we could provide those tutors and everyone again they'd be part of that principal staff we'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| training them on deployment and where to strategically put them based on the data that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| they have so you see this is where our model could be a little different than the state model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7154)|
| 1:59:20| we're talking about 250 hires that we would have to have for three years for these tutors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| we really just don't think our market will allow us to hire more than that right now i mean if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| really wanted to scale up to get to one to three ratios across the board for every kid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| we're probably talking six seven hundred tutors i don't think we can bring them on in the in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| the way that we're talking about inclusion and pushing them into classrooms and do that now we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| might be able to cobble that together by pulling part-time college students and you know retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| people and that sort of thing but but based on the model we're looking for to be very focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| in what we're doing we don't think that would necessarily play out for us that way now again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| reserving this this is brand new we get into year one and we can't get over 50 tutors to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| we may make modifications to that as we go out but right now this is our plan that we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| comfortable with and i think principals have felt comfortable with to have those conversations as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| well moving down to the last one on track recruit retain highly effective middle school math and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| algebra teachers the first part of this is we know every year because math hires are hard to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7213)|
| 2:00:20| there's not a lot of folks out there doing that we know we have a large group that are new every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| year identify our math teachers who are already really good in that space offer them a stipend to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| be mentors to the new teachers who are coming on board in math what we've seen in the past is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7231)|
| 2:00:36| you hope to do good teachers can get there in two or three years to be highly impactful to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7236)|
| 2:00:42| but with a mentor sometimes you can accelerate that impact in about a year to a year and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| they can be performing at the level they would if they were kind of left on their own for three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| years so our hope is to be able to replicate and mimic some of those things and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| turn our new teachers into high power teachers early on and then the last strategy on here i| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| think is another one that's probably a year two or three out if we have tutors that are doing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| great job in that math space and they and they meet some of the requirements we'd like to tap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| them to go in to be math teachers for us and work with an epp or educational prep program we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7268)|
| 2:01:14| own now for cte and math may be a little more challenging but it's something we could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| look at with the state down the road but we could work with our other partners to look at that too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| so kind of tap people we know there's going to be a shortage in years out we know there's a shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| now so we'd like to look at that area three is going to talk a lot about what we did around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| forward last week around career advising academic supports portrait of a graduate graduate what a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| ready graduate looks like um so here's some some neat strategies in this one if we look under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| first one um as we talked last week it kind of that very first bullet point talks about uh building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7301)|
| 2:01:47| scope and sequence and intentional plan around the technical technical programs advanced academic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| programs at every high school like that doesn't sound like a lot but like that could be a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| cool thing for us as a district to be able to say every school in every neighborhood has advanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| academic academics and robust cte and by that we're talking about industry partners aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7320)|
| 2:02:05| workforce development for our region and programs that really matter and i'm not saying our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| programs don't but as we tighten and make those really happen the way they could i think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| could be a source of pride for every community um so in order to do that you'll see phases four and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7333)|
| 2:02:19| five for the ford work in here um i think miss horn said that uh for us last week um our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| at knox ed foundation and chris has been a good part of that too have agreed to do phases two and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| three of that plan and then we pick up three and four and esser i'll say this the great thing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7349)|
| 2:02:34| ford is this they do help with that process they don't have a program as they said yesterday or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| last week but at the end of this they kind of fade away like after you've gone through step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| five they're not looking for like another 10 year commitment to going to phase six through ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7364)|
| 2:02:48| this is their process at five so there is an ability to stay in the network um and i think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| it's a fairly you know low price to do that so you can continue to do visits and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| but really the building of this master plan and this work is a process that fits really nicely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| into something like esser that we think will be toward the end of that and have our master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| by the by that time so we're encouraged by that uh the next strategy down talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| um my print's much smaller than it is up there talks about expanding work-based learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7391)|
| 2:03:16| opportunities for each high school this is we're talking about a community-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| approach to cte program this is actually i'll give keith and danny credit for this one they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| they were part of this process really thinking about what what did students lose out in during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| covet and and part of that was students who did work-based learning they couldn't go out last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| year so we lost a lot of those opportunities for them to be out there if they were in that career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| and in a career path which made them think which was a great idea we had kids even prior to covet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| who didn't have transportation and couldn't go out and do those kinds of things and that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| have been a limiting factor for them so the idea on this one is that we put dollars into facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| uh we're saying kind of earmarking like 500,000 per site and principals who are listening you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7431)|
| 2:03:56| not getting a check for 500,000 all right i just want to say that uh five thousand dollars per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| site approximately that would go to facilities and then as they go through the forward work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7441)|

| 2:05:55| we are going to need some people to help us lead that work in the coming years and there's also we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7555)|
| 2:05:59| mentioned before transitions to ninth and sixth and ninth grade which would be an expansion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| our summer bridge program with students who are behind and then also expanding our credit recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| so we kind of have our credit recovery the way we always do it i know danny and his secondary team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| have some other ideas and shannon thinking about with the large number of kids that need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7572)|

| 2:06:19| dollars set aside for that the final part of this is really looking at our high school model if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7579)|
| 2:06:28| go down to review and analyze student course requests and that sort of thing so we so a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| of this is data reporting aspen is our student information system which most people in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| probably don't care but so they probably check their kids grades on that that's probably where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| they get it but there's a lot more things that it does if we're going to be good at tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| sixth through twelfth graders there's a lot of data points that we've got to pull together to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| put in usable files and a lot of that's put throughout here i haven't gone into that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7609)|

| 2:06:57| and that's a lot of work to do in the next three years but this would be one of those places where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| we might have some dollars put aside for uh we might have to build some reporting structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| out in aspen to be able to pull that data down also i'll say this high school our high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| tutoring model in here is going to be different than middle and elementary number one it's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| harder to get tutors in high school because it's a lot more specialized so it's hard to find a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| latin tutor right because latin teachers used to the one who knows latin um so our thought in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| again working with danny's department is that we'll do allocations for dollars for time cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7643)|
| 2:07:28| for schools over the next three years with a real focus on recovery credit so uh we're going to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| principals a lot of autonomy in that to help bring plans back to danny and his team to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| it could be that they pay a teacher to teach on their plan to tutor to help kids recover credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| it could be before or after school we even had some people talk about like virtual math helplines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| and we're willing to try that again it's a space we don't know and we want to see what what's best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7667)|

| 2:07:53| strategies to be able to do that but again focus more toward recovery credits and credits where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| people where students are behind the next is going to be around interventions to close academic gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7678)|
| 2:08:04| for students i'm excited about the first strategy on this one for sure again our our thought in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7684)|
| 2:08:12| is to build capacity in the school kind of teach them to fish they know how to fish a lot already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7692)|

| 2:10:44| to communicate that and also be able to monitor that from the inside so we think that'll be it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7844)|

| 2:11:21| our teaching force was not a coveted issue right we kind of knew that existed before so there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| places where we think we can still work some strategies in but to the extent we were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| to hopefully go there uh the needs assessment won't support that but there are some neat things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| from this that i think will work uh oops i'm on the total wrong one that's a great setup for priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7895)|

| 2:12:14| better at those strategies and so um the other thing we've done is is mostly schools that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=7934)|

| 2:25:43| coming online so we have a sense of when those are beginning execution um and then also i know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8743)|
| 2:25:49| that there's a lot of outcome measurement and data reporting that both the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| is asking for in the state but also that we're going to want to do on our own anyway to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| to understand the impact of that plan um and i think it'll be important as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8758)|
| 2:26:03| to be able to see some of that impact even at an iterative basis you know i don't think we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8763)|
| 2:26:08| wait until um you know the end of september 2024 to kind of understand how that needle's moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8768)|
| 2:26:14| and as you mentioned before um you know we do we are coming through a pandemic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8774)|
| 2:26:19| you know we would there's some belief that it might take three to five years for some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| to rebound and i think that's okay in the sense of as long as we're um we're thoughtful about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8783)|
| 2:26:30| and we're understanding how that needle is moving as long as it's moving um and so anyway i just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8790)|
| 2:26:36| would continue to advocate for those things and then i only have one uh two questions you you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8796)|
| 2:26:42| mentioned earlier and i know you said you're still engaged with the state on this that if we hit a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| certain benchmark i think it was 50 there may be additional funding from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8807)|
| 2:26:52| um do we have any sense of what that dollar amount could be or range i know it's not exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8812)|
| 2:26:57| at this point or what are we hearing from that so um good question thank you the i don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8817)|
| 2:27:05| it's totally clear yet some some things we've heard so far is like some uh some assistance in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| planning um so like our there was like a planning grant that we were eligible for 150 000 over an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8830)|
| 2:27:16| additional 50 000 you know for making a choice like that um they've they've so far things have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| been a little more vague they've kind of said you know you'll move to the top of the line for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| reimbursement by doing that you'll um you'll have some additional like supports from the state on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8845)|
| 2:27:31| monitoring that sort of thing i haven't seen like an like an amount like you know how you'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| eligible for five million more if you do this or that um so i think it's probably going to be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| online support i'm sorry kind of in kind support that's what that's what it looks like based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| what we've read right now and then that doesn't mean here's my guess my guess is at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| with the state getting their dollars too over the course of these three years they'll probably have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| some like granted dollars that this will put you in the front of the line but we haven't seen like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8875)|
| 2:28:00| kind of like what those are yet um and so so like part of that is tutoring on their on their tutoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8880)|
| 2:28:05| model for the all core tutoring and there's a lot of discussion around some of that there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8885)|
| 2:28:10| very um there's they're good but there's some very kind of stringent timelines about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| percentages of kids that have to be served and this that and and ratios that add in a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8895)|
| 2:28:20| of minutes and that kind of stuff and so um i think we're going to probably qualify for all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8900)|
| 2:28:25| that um just in case you're here because that's kind of out there um right now our biggest is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8905)|
| 2:28:29| probably going to be on ratio um like that the the recommended ratio is three to one like in the k2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8909)|
| 2:28:36| um you know you saw our goal was to get 150 tutors we don't know yet so that's what i'm saying i would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| be apprehensive to accept like that part of the tutoring till we know because what if we can only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8920)|
| 2:28:45| find 75 it's going to affect our ratios i think the state will give us flexibility we have still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| have some calls with them on that but uh so far it looks like it's going to be kind of more in kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8928)|
| 2:28:53| and probably some preferential on reimbursement i'm guessing on future grants and that sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| thing as they bring more dollars in we probably have some thank you and my last question so for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| those in the public who aren't as engaged in federal grant making and state level grant making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8941)|
| 2:29:07| and those kinds of things i think some people can look at that 14 million dollars of indirect cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| right off the top and say whoa that seems a little bit strange and i know you referenced it a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8951)|
| 2:29:16| bit but can you give a little bit more clarity about why that is pretty standard practice and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8956)|
| 2:29:21| what types of things those would be used for i may actually defer to ron because he i mean he he does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8961)|
| 2:29:26| that on a regular basis i know again that's that's something that that is allowable as kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8966)|
| 2:29:32| administrative cost on almost everything we pull through but i'll defer to him on that thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| okay yeah thank you thank you mr watson uh so the indirect cost is based on a percentage that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8976)|
| 2:29:42| allowable with federal grants so we we take those with with all federal grants the reason this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8982)|
| 2:29:48| is so large it's about four well i mean the grant the federal in uh indirect cost rate 14 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8988)|
| 2:29:55| right so and and then we would claim all all of that that would go into the general purpose budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=8995)|
| 2:30:02| the thought process process behind indirect cost is that there is a lot of administrative work and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9002)|
| 2:30:08| there is it goes into administering the grants and so forth so that's kind of the premise behind an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9008)|
| 2:30:13| indirect well you you know you run a non-profit so you probably get all of that but for the sake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| of some others maybe they don't so at this point we haven't designated those funds for any particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9017)|
| 2:30:24| type of spending because one thing we recognize is that s or dollars are one-time funds uh so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9024)|
| 2:30:31| have you know till what september of 2024 so we recognize that these funds will uh lapse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9031)|
| 2:30:40| right and so we want to be in a strong position when that happens that if there are initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| that we can continue on that we can sustain we think they're worthwhile in order to sustain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| we want to be in the strongest financial position we can be so i think it's important that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9049)|
| 2:30:53| continue to try to build those reserves so absent of any designation for those funds those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| would close into fund balance so it would actually strengthen our reserves in the general purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| budget um so that's kind of the that's the premise behind indirect cost and it also gives the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9063)|
| 2:31:10| more flexibility that if they if they close into general purpose and the board wants to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9070)|
| 2:31:17| with those dollars that would not be you know and necessarily uh even covet related the board could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9077)|
| 2:31:24| do that with those dollars what would you say to the person who would present the counter argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| of we understand there's indirect costs but we should be spending all of this directly well we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9088)|
| 2:31:33| could do that right you know if the board if the board decided that hey we would rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9093)|
| 2:31:37| we wouldn't we want to take those dollars and we want we want to implement those for uh you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9097)|
| 2:31:43| certain initiatives um you know the board could certainly do that there's there's nothing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| would you know would stop the board from doing that it would just be probably in the form of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| what i would call a fund balance designation because any unspent funds would would close into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210804?start=9111)|
