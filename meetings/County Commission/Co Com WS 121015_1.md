| 2:41:37| So we're adjourned now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9697)|
| 2:41:38| Insolvency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9701)|
| 2:41:42| Who's insolvency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| That's Larry and Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| Do you all want to come on around here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| Or do you want to stay where you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| He's comfy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9711)|
| 2:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| Dave, you don't have to sit over there all by yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| You can come over here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9719)|
| 2:42:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| I now get to sit on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| I'm going to call the insolvency board to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| And thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| And I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Chad Tyndall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| who's going to give us he's going to introduce some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| and give us a rundown on why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9743)|
| 2:42:26| Thank you, Commissioner Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| I did want to address one procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| I know you've had to address some procedural questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| I had an opportunity at recess to speak with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| He questioned whether that recess was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| It's my understanding, speaking further with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| that it is appropriate for the chair of that meeting, who was Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9760)|
| 2:42:45| to note the absence of a quorum and recess the meeting until a quorum can be established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| which is done now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9770)|
| 2:42:52| My understanding is it's procedurally appropriate in talking with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| I want to make sure we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| I have talked with each of the I spoke briefly with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9778)|
| 2:43:03| I've talked personally with Commissioner Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| And then in the meeting earlier today, prior to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9785)|
| 2:43:08| I briefed Commissioner McKenzie and Commissioner Smith concerning the insolvency board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9788)|
| 2:43:13| and what we're trying to do just in this short meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| Community Development Trustee's Office and a number of others are working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| to develop an improved process for disposing of county-owned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9802)|
| 2:43:26| property purchased at a tax sale, which has then become surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| In the past, what was discovered is in trying to document that the insolvency board had properly looked at all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9810)|
| 2:43:37| which have accumulated over the last four and a half years because that the insolvency board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9817)|
| 2:43:42| that there had been no surplus sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9822)|
| 2:43:45| We could not document because the insolvency board had not kept any minutes of their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9825)|
| 2:43:49| And in order to properly document, it could be that the insolvency board at some point in time in the past has looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9829)|
| 2:43:54| these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9834)|
| 2:43:55| However, without being able to document that, we wanted to make sure before we moved ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| In addition, we had also the problem that the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| and insolvency board were essentially doing the process of approving these properties for sale backwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9843)|
| 2:44:09| because they were, the commission was looking at them, and then the insolvency board would look at them, and that's backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9849)|
| 2:44:14| In talking with the law director, we, the law director confirmed my reading of the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9854)|
| 2:44:18| and that is that insolvency needs to look at these, and then commission does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| So in this instance, it could be that insolvency has looked at these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| but we're trying to make sure that we simply dot that I and cross that T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| Excuse me, Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| That reminded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9870)|
| 2:44:32| The first thing we need to do, actually, right now, we need a vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| We need a secretary so that we have minutes of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9875)|
| 2:44:40| So I will entertain nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| I will accept my previous appointment as vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9883)|
| 2:44:48| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9888)|
| 2:44:49| And secretary, Dave, Larry, you want to flip for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9889)|
| 2:44:53| I nominate Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9898)|
| 2:44:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9899)|
| 2:45:00| Larry, I assume that you're the only one opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9900)|
| 2:45:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9904)|
| 2:45:05| So, Larry, you're going to need to take minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| I think we have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9909)|
| 2:45:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9917)|
| 2:45:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9920)|
| 2:45:21| We need a short timeout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| The clerk's taking the minutes for you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| And then you're proceeding from now on, you'll be good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| They're here to cover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| So today the clerk's designee is taking minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| And then in the future, Larry, it will be you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9937)|
| 2:45:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9941)|
| 2:45:42| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9942)|
| 2:45:43| I'm sorry, Chad, for interrupting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9943)|
| 2:45:44| No, not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9944)|
| 2:45:45| I'm glad we took care of that detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9945)|
| 2:45:46| As I explained, the full commission has already voted to sell these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9946)|
| 2:45:50| They've been surplus for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| But I want this committee, as well as the full commission, if there are others here present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9952)|
| 2:45:57| to rest assured that community development, Rebecca Gibson and Ian Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| who are both with community development, have done a substantial amount of work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9960)|
| 2:46:04| It was my idea to try to develop a better process to sell our own properties because we would get more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9964)|
| 2:46:10| develop more revenue and make better use of them for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9970)|
| 2:46:13| Community development and others and Grant Rosenberg prior to Miss Gibson were very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9973)|
| 2:46:17| very, very helpful in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| And I think we're going to come forward and in the future this will provide the foundation for a much better process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9979)|
| 2:46:23| of disposing of county-owned properties or properties purchased at the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| But in this instance, all we need is full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9987)|
| 2:46:31| Each of you has already voted to sell these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| We simply want to document that the insolvency board has looked at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9993)|
| 2:46:37| The insolvency board has approved them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9997)|
| 2:46:38| Then we can move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| Community development is going to schedule a lunch or a workshop with the full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10000)|
| 2:46:44| with a slick of photographs and information on each of these properties, the proposed use of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10004)|
| 2:46:49| I know that Dwight VanDeVate is looking at some of these that could be utilized by the Knox County for stormwater control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10009)|
| 2:46:56| I know that there are some that the city is interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10016)|
| 2:46:59| And the city may be willing to take over the obligations of maintaining these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| or utilizing them for something that benefits the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10022)|
| 2:47:05| And I think that there are many opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10025)|
| 2:47:07| And Ian Christie has gone out and personally inspected each of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| You're going to be presented with full information on what's going to be done with these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| I will tell you, most will end up in a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10035)|
| 2:47:18| But I mentioned a couple of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| In addition to that, we're also going to issue, the community development is going to issue an RFP to housing partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10040)|
| 2:47:26| If they're housing partners willing to make the commitment to develop these properties and make them better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10046)|
| 2:47:30| it's better we do that than it is to simply auction them off for a few hundred dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10050)|
| 2:47:35| because they're going to make the neighborhoods better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| All of this is geared toward putting these properties to the most productive use rather than simply liquidating them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10057)|
| 2:47:42| with me standing up here and conducting a public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| I think that's a better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| And you're going to have full information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| What I would ask the Insolvency Board to do is to simply ratify and confirm the vote that has already been taken by the full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10068)|
| 2:47:53| commission that these properties be sold as surplus and that they be disposed of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| pending further reports from community development as to what's going to be done with each of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10077)|
| 2:48:02| And I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10082)|
| 2:48:03| I know some of you had questions earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| Quick question, Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10088)|
| 2:48:09| I appreciate you giving us a picture of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| But also it would be very helpful with a map along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10094)|
| 2:48:15| And I believe that in the meeting earlier today, each of these properties would be broken down by commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10095)|
| 2:48:20| So each commissioner would be able to see what properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| And I'm sure that Ian will know, and it may be already on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| that we've got a map to sort of demonstrate where these properties are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| A collective map, is that fine to show where the properties are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10109)|
| 2:48:32| Yeah, just plot them on one map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10112)|
| 2:48:35| Well, no, not on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10115)|
| 2:48:36| And we already have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| Ms. Gibson says we already have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| But you're not going to put all 40 or 50 pieces on one map, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10119)|
| 2:48:43| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10123)|
| 2:48:44| Or if you want individual maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10124)|
| 2:48:45| Yeah, individual maps showing whereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10125)|
| 2:48:48| That shouldn't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10128)|
| 2:48:49| That would be so minute because they're very tiny pieces, a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| Well, would it be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| Could you do it by probably not district but by sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10135)|
| 2:49:00| Ms. Gibson says that we have a KGS map on each slick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| On each piece of property, we will have a KGS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| So we should be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| I'm not calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| I suppose you're asking me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| I'm going to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| I'm sorry I was not here this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| I'm just now back in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| The action, though, that we're confirming is on things that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10161)|
| 2:49:26| sales that have already been conducted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10166)|
| 2:49:30| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10170)|
| 2:49:31| None of these properties have been sold yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| Commission has simply authorized them to be sold, which should have been the second step instead of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10173)|
| 2:49:38| These then came to county possession due to prior tax sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10178)|
| 2:49:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10183)|
| 2:49:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10184)|
| 2:49:44| This has been sale 16, 16B, and 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10184)|
| 2:49:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10190)|
| 2:49:51| And because no one outbid us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10191)|
| 2:49:54| No one bid more than the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| The county now owns them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| Yes, and has owned them for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| And now we're preparing to try to move them on to some productive use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10201)|
| 2:50:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| And in addition, I wouldn't mention to the Insolvency Board, we will have 18B properties coming in for the county ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10208)|
| 2:50:15| The one-year period of redemption from the time of the order confirming the sale will be sometime, I think, in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10215)|
| 2:50:20| The first week of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10220)|
| 2:50:21| So we'll be scheduling and we'll be asking Commissioner Burles to schedule a number of meetings of the Insolvency Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10221)|
| 2:50:25| to add those 18B properties in, which was the last tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10225)|
| 2:50:30| There was no 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10230)|
| 2:50:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10232)|
| 2:50:35| I don't have an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| That was before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10236)|
| 2:50:40| A lot of this is before my time, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| No, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10246)|
| 2:50:47| Madam Chairman, before you, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| We have a statement that needs to be read to the record from the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10249)|
| 2:50:54| Ms. Angie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| I'm going to read into the record confirmation of prior commission approval for sale of county-owned surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10257)|
| 2:51:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10271)|
| 2:51:12| So a proper motion would be, as I look to Chad, that we confirm this process for disposal of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10272)|
| 2:51:20| Yes, because the resolution previously passed by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10283)|
| 2:51:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10284)|
| 2:51:25| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10285)|
| 2:51:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10286)|
| 2:51:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| And we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10291)|
| 2:51:32| Thank you also very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS121015?start=10292)|
