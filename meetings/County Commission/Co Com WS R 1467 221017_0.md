| 0:26:17| understand that they are putting on a black robe. It is a black robe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=1577)|

| 0:26:28| if that, you cannot, the first question they need to ask herself is, did the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=1588)|

| 0:46:43| county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2803)|

| 0:46:53| is maintained by its public officials and county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2813)|

| 0:47:07| and they are amenable to somebody in the legal profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| It has its judicial character, and that, of course, is my profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| I've been a lawyer for 27-plus years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2835)|

| 0:47:24| And also, in my background, I have served on the Professionalism Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| with the Knox County Bar Association for 10 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| And one of the roles of the Professionalism Committee is to consider proposed ethical rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2854)|
| 0:47:45| that would be applicable to the legal profession and advise on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| And so I've been involved in thinking about ethics issues for the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2877)|

| 0:48:52| My name is Neil Harvey-Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| I thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| I also at this time would like to thank Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| who continues to send e-mails allowing me to know about some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| programs that are available to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| I recently graduated from the Attorney General's Citizens Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| It was a wonderful opportunity, and, again, I thank you, sir, for that notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| I feel that the knowledge and experience I can bring to this committee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| based entirely on my 16 years' experience as a financial industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| regulatory authority arbitrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| A FINRA arbitrator has a duty to offer full disclosure in any of the cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2974)|
| 0:49:42| that they are assigned to and to reveal any conflicts of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| I know this is an important aspect of the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| In the 16 years that I have been an arbitrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| I've had more than 100 cases assigned to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| Of these 100 cases, 17 have gone to hearings of the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| I may be a sole arbitrator in any hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| I may judge a hearing and decide a hearing based solely on the papers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| are provided to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| I may be part of a three-person panel in which all three members have equal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| say in how the decision is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| I have accepted the responsibility as an arbitrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| knowing full well that the decisions that I make can impact a person's life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| profoundly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| When I first learned about the Ethics Committee, I asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| is this something that related to my experience as an arbitrator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| And I said yes, because most arbitration cases and claims involve ethics as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| well as violations of rules or contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| I maintain the knowledge and I consider it an evolving responsibility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| acquire knowledge on things that are happening within the financial industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| as well as other governmental agencies and how it affects the financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| This is not much different than the government of a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| As currently I have learned about more of an upcoming thing that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| learned also that's coming down the road in arbitration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| which is the training repayment agreement provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| otherwise known ironically as the TRAPS provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| The TRAPS provisions may be something that will become a necessity to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| aware of within Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| It does involve employees and employees' contracts and how an employee may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| held responsible for their ethics regarding these contracts as well as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| county being held responsible for the contractual obligations to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| I feel, again, that this is something that I can commit myself to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| that I can be a valuable member to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| I have familiarized myself with past meetings of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| and I know what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| I know who you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| I know the current members of the committee and their fantastic contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| And I also know that through the efforts of the committee that there have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| been very few ethics complaints lodged against the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| With that, I will appreciate and accept any of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| Commissioners, would anyone like to ask a question of Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| I just wanted to thank you for putting yourself out there and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| willingness to serve and come before us and talk about your credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3177)|

| 0:53:03| Would you please approach the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| and anything you would like to say to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Debbie Stafford, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| And I apologize, I'm a little under the weather tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| After hearing the credentials of these first two fine gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| I feel a little inadequate being up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| I come to you more as just a citizen than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| When you want to look at technical qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| I do have an associate's in accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| I helped manage a construction company for three years and then did some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| series of smaller bookkeeping businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| I'm very familiar with GAP, generally accepted accounting principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| Of course, now you all know, I work as a nurse practitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| I think I understand ethics more in a holistic stance than the technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| legal jargon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| I'm putting myself out there because, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I do believe I have a basic understanding of the requirements of the ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| And, two, I feel like we need to get more just plain citizens on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| committees to serve as taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| I am a business owner and have owned my own clinic for the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| so I'm familiar with the financial ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| But that's really about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| I'm glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| Thank you, Ms. Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| I'm just going to reiterate, Ms. Stafford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| thank you for coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Thank you for putting yourself out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| It is exciting over the last few years to see a few more people actually step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| up in the community that want to serve on these boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| They're certainly not the most fun sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| and people need to know that you don't get paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| But it takes a lot to come down here and put yourself out there and being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| willing to serve people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| So I really appreciate everybody that's willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| Any other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Thank you, Ms. Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3295)|

| 0:55:00| Our next applicant is Mr. Joel Weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Mr. Weeks, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3303)|

| 0:55:12| Joel Weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| I'd like to start off by saying that it is a pleasure to be here in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| the commission, and I want to say that I'm a 22-year veteran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3322)|

| 0:55:34| Since then I've volunteered for both the Knox County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3334)|

| 0:55:43| I had to return to work and recently retired again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| and I believe that I have the credentials to be on the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3347)|
| 0:55:55| because I believe a part of being a police officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| you have a lot of ethics with integrity and honesty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| and it would be a pleasure to serve on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3364)|

| 0:57:31| Employees Merit System Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| Commissioner, since Commissioner Beeler's motion to approve our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| included adding this one to it, and it was a unanimous vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| we do not need to vote specifically to get that two-thirds vote requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| I just wanted to make everyone aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3474)|

| 0:58:01| with a second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| We have five applicants for this two-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| on the Knox County Sheriff's Office Employees Merit System Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3493)|

| 0:58:24| John Valiant, and Steve Weiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| It will be very similar to our ethics applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| We will call you up to speak at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| Commission can ask you questions, and then we will vote formally on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| Our first applicant is Michael Crichton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| Mr. Crichton, you would please approach the podium if you are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3525)|
| 0:58:54| I don't see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| We will come back to him at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| Our next applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| Please state your name and county of residence for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| and anything you would like Commission to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| My name is Michael Crichton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| I live in the Halls area, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| I'm still applying for the Ethics Committee position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| I was a police officer and deputy sheriff for 30 years in Southern California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| My career spanned from Vietnam War protests to 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| I'm sure you probably aren't interested in the Hollywood stars that I had to arrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| or whatnot, but I covered pretty much every aspect of law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3591)|
| 0:59:58| from patrol, corrections, working detectives, working undercover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| working technical services, working dispatch, court services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| I sat on oral boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| I did employee evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| I supervised 419 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| You probably really want to know what can I deal with employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| I have no human resource experience as far as sitting down at a desk and doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| But what I can tell you is that I have worked on situations like 10 detectives and 8 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3631)|
| 1:00:39| What do you do when I have two female deputies working for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| and they're dating the same man?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| What do you do when somebody doesn't get promoted who actually does need it, deserves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| but it's a budgetary restraint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| And how do you keep that person motivated and moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| What do you do when you're unjustly accused by the public of violation of some ordinance or laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3661)|
| 1:01:10| So those I have experience in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| And I think that I can honestly evaluate situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3674)|
| 1:01:25| And then after my law enforcement career, I taught school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| Nobody knows fair better than kids on the playground, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| And I solved disputes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| And except for losing a lot of my hair, I've survived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| So I think that's it, unless you have any further questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| Well, we are certainly glad you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Commissioners, do you have any questions or any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Mr. Creighton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Do you believe it's important to follow our nation's laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| It's what defines us as Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| We are a nation of laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Do you believe it's important to follow the laws even if you don't personally believe in or agree with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| My last question is, if elected to serve as a volunteer on the Merit System Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| will you abide by all the sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| specifically outlining Section 42 through 53 of the ordinance that governs this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| and cease from any political participation as outlined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| I will abide by that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| Thank you again for your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| And I just have a couple of questions, and anyone else who is an applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| if you'll just kind of listen in, these are the same questions I will also be asking you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| Mr. Crichton, have you had an opportunity to read the policies and procedures of the Merit System?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| I just skimmed it, but I read it once, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Can you tell me in your own words the role of the Merit System Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| who it serves, and the responsibility of the board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| It serves the employees of the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| The responsibility is to ensure proper treatment of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| Then I have one last question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Thank you for those answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Are you aware of the roles and responsibilities of the Merit System staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| and the role of the board member to support those staff members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| Aside from not being involved in politics, no, I'd have to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3815)|
| 1:03:43| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| My question, Mr. Crichton, would be why do you want to serve on the Merit Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| That's really pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| My dad charged up Omaha Beach in the opening hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| He survived, came back, and instilled in his three children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| that you make the world a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| As a law enforcement officer and as a teacher, I think I've done a pretty good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| While I thoroughly enjoyed law enforcement, teaching was an entirely different aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| but I went into teaching for the simple reason that I was arresting, fighting people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| three generations of family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| I wasn't making any headway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| But I thought if I could teach and get them young enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| I could prevent a lot of problems in society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| And I think I really did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| The kids know me as Mr. C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| I can't pronounce Crichton, so they call me Mr. C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| But I think I've done a good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| and I think that it still is in keeping with my entire adult life of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3904)|
| 1:05:12| Thank you for your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| Any more questions for Mr. Crichton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| Mr. Dennis Ford, you are next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| Next, please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| State your name and county of residence for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| and any additional information you would like to give commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| My name is Dennis Ford, 1506 Thorn Grove Park, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| and I'm back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| Thank you all for the opportunity to come back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| And as I left here the last time we met, we were in a tie and different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| And as I prayed and considered about whether to come back or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| the Lord laid on my heart that you've never run from anything before in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| and this is no time to start running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| This is an opportunity to serve with the gifts and the graces that God has given me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3967)|
| 1:06:13| I have sent you out a resume this time that you should have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| Did everybody get one of those this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| That detailed a little bit more about my past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| And I think that in that I bring a device of different things of experience to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3983)|
| 1:06:33| but the most important thing that I bring to the table is where I am now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| I am a pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| I have been a pastor for the last 31, 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| They refer to me as Andy Griffith Pastor, and I can communicate with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| And I think in a world that so much distrust and anger and all that's going on in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4011)|
| 1:07:00| the merit system is a place where the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| and the sheriff's employees both are included in the decisions that are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| It has to be a place that those deputies can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| and feel like that the people that are sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| And I think I bring my experiences as a pastor that they can trust that they'll be treated fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| that they'll be listened to with no prejudices, with no political prejudice or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| Just the facts of the case will be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| and those decisions will be made on those merits and those merits alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| I stated that last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| And that's why I'm here again, and I offer my service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| My life will go on whether you choose me or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| My church hasn't run me off yet, so I've got somewhere to go Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| But I would like to be considered, and I would like to be a part of the great sheriff's office that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4078)|
| 1:08:06| and to reinstate with those employees the fact that they've got some place that they can bring their grievances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4086)|
| 1:08:14| Be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| Thank you, Mr. Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Mr. Ford, I have the same questions for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| If you would please tell me, have you had the opportunity to read the policies and the procedures of the merit system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| And can you tell me in your own words the role of the merit system council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| who it serves, and the responsibility of the members, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| I thought I did in my remarks, but I'll address them right straight back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| They are that place that hears those grievances of the employees of the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4122)|
| 1:08:49| They're there to be a sounding board between the sheriff's office and the discipline of the officers, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| Have you had the chance to read the policies and procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| And then last question, are you aware of the role's responsibilities of the merit system staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| and are you willing to support them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4145)|
| 1:09:07| I am willing to support them, but I'm not aware of the details of their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| Thank you, Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Mr. Ford, do you believe it's important to follow our nation's and county's laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| Do you believe it's important to follow those same laws, even if you don't personally believe in or agree with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| I went to Vietnam believing that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| If elected to serve as a volunteer on the merit system board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| will you abide by section 4253C-2 of the ordinance that governs this merit system body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| and cease from participation in all political activities as outlined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Mr. Ford, I'd like to ask you the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| Why would you want to serve on this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| Because I think that is a part of my background, my age and experience that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4203)|
| 1:10:12| I think it would be advantage to that board at this particular point in time in history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| when, like I said, this world is upside down with distrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| As we watch county commission meetings, you know, there's something else going on here besides me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4224)|
| 1:10:32| As far as politics goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| And in the midst of that, you've got to treat people fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| You've got to let people understand that when they come to this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| they'll be treated by the merits of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| And that's the same way that I feel like that's why I'm going through this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| Thank you for your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| Any other commissioners wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4255)|
| 1:10:59| Thank you, Mr. Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| I'll see you Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| Our next applicant is Sarah Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Miss Keith, if you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| State your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4269)|
| 1:11:18| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| My name is Sarah Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| I am a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| I am applying for this board because public service is in the fabric of who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4283)|
| 1:11:30| I saw this opportunity to serve on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| and it was frankly too good of an opportunity to pass up attempting to serve my community in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| You have a copy of my resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| I've spent the past 16 years working as a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| The vast majority of that was in the prosecutor's office in this county and in other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| So I've had the opportunity through that to review law enforcement actions every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| I'm currently working in private practice doing criminal and civil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| and so that continues where I'm reviewing actions every single day and trying to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| obviously in my prosecution experience, as objectively as possible on each and every case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| because those things matter to the people and the parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| And that's certainly analogous to this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| and what I would be doing as a member of this merit council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| Each and every person who comes forward to either apply for a job, apply for a promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| who maybe was demoted or is facing dismissal, deserves to have that heard fairly and objectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4349)|
| 1:12:37| And that is important not only for those individuals who are facing promotion, hiring, or discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4357)|
| 1:12:45| That's profoundly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| It's hard to overstate the importance of what that is to the culture of the department as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| because they all see how each person is treated, and that matters collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| And so now we can expand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| That doesn't just matter to that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| That matters to our community because how our law enforcement culture and progress is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| is how we interact every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| how law enforcement operates affects each and every single one of us every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| even if we don't have a personal encounter with a law enforcement officer every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| It's the community we live in, and those things matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| And so we look at the big forest of our community from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| and then we have to take it back down and look at the trees for each of those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| who are facing a hiring, a firing, or a dismissal or a promotion type of decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| And those have to be taken with all seriousness and the gravity that each of those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| and that our departments and our community deserves on each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| And I believe that I have the experience to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| I have tremendous respect for our law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| I've been in the opportunity to work side-by-side with them and go to court fighting for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| supporting the work they had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| We've also had the opportunity to look at cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| and had to determine that they acted improperly in those cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| and make those decisions where it may have even resulted in charges against a law enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| I believe that I have the experience to do this fairly and objectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| And, again, I believe that's what each person deserves, is that they have their day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| they are evaluated appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| we have policies enacted that are best practices for the law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| and for our community to, again, enhance the integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| The opportunity to support our community in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| and contribute to the integrity of our law enforcement, again, was an opportunity too good to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| It's a tremendous public service opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| and I appreciate you giving me the chance to address my qualifications for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| and my desire to serve on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| Thank you, Ms. Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Thank you, Ms. Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| I've actually already talked to a couple of the applicants from last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| so since you're new, I wanted to ask you a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| I do appreciate you taking your time to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| It's very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| This board is pretty important to me as I just rolled off of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| and I know the importance for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| You do understand that this merit council is strictly to protect the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| It has nothing to do with any sheriff that is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| This is something where the officers are taking their appeals to this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| and, again, the board setting up policies that are best practices for those law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| I think this board, this council, will probably have to look at a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| that they've not had to deal with in the past as far as we are dealing with retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| we're dealing with being able to get officers to come into the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| and I think the merit council is probably going to have to do some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| that they maybe not have done in the past to encourage the retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| or encourage people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| Do you have any ideas of things that you could do with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| Well, I think the easiest answer and the way to say something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| but the hardest answer in actually implementing is increase salaries, increase benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| That's easier said than done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| Of course, I know looking at any budgetary board, the standard of living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| the respect that officers get, any sort of benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| all of those things contribute to how much respect they get for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| I don't think that anyone who goes into law enforcement is going into it for the big salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| They're there because typically they have an idea that they want to serve the community in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4605)|
| 1:16:52| And so, again, the easier answer is put money at something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| The harder answer is giving them the respect they deserve, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| big picture and on an individual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| because they're not doing it to get a big, huge retirement, to get rich,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| and they're not doing it for a ticker tape parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| But I think that my interactions with law enforcement officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| each one of them care about respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Each one of them care about doing what's right and people recognizing the work that they put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| And so we can look at other opportunities to show respect to people that can be a benefit to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4648)|
| 1:17:35| because people generally, you know, you can have a great salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| but if you hate your boss or you hate the environment you're in and your coworkers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| you're not going to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| You can have a salary where you can live and love the environment you're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4663)|
| 1:17:49| love your coworkers, love your administration, and it can make all the difference in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| So there are situations like that where we could really be looking outside the box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| looking at what other departments are doing locally but also nationwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| and see what's working, see what's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| There's no sense in reinventing the wheel in a lot of those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| We can look and see what's something that's plausible to implement here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| and what's best in the resources that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| Awesome. Perfect. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Thank you again for coming down here. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Thank you, Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Thank you, Ms. Keith, for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Out of all fairness, you really have answered my first question about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| tell me in your own words about the responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| Have you had a chance to read the policies and procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| I have, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| My other question for you is, are you aware of the roles and responsibilities of the merit system staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| and would you be willing to support them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| In a survey type of situation, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| In a nitty-gritty, obviously there's a lot of that that comes with the experience of serving on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| But am I willing to support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| That's part of the job, that communication, the professionalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| the day-to-day work that comes with that and being responsive to a staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4737)|
| 1:19:03| It's oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| It's all of those different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Ideally working together to, again, make the board go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4746)|
| 1:19:13| progress working toward the common goal of supporting law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| and having fair implementation and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4758)|
| 1:19:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Thank you, Ms. Keith, for replying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Do you believe it's important to follow our nation and county's laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| Do you believe it's important to follow the laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| even if you don't personally believe in or agree with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| As someone who has worked in the legal field for 16 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| I can say there are laws I've agreed with and supported fully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| and that's a whole lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| And there are laws that I've disagreed with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| but it hasn't been my position to go counter to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| There's a process if someone doesn't like a law or a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| or an ordinance to change that in a situation of the context of a merit board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| it is certainly not the role of anyone on the merit board to, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| go rogue or try to change any type of statute, ordinance, or policy individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| And so, yes, I believe that even if I disagree with the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| it is important to still obey and come in compliance with our laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4820)|
| 1:20:27| in this state and country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| If elected to serve as a volunteer on the merit system board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| will you abide by Section 4253C2 of the ordinance that governs this merit system body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| and cease from participation in all political activity as outlined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Again, I think that is a reasonable ask for people who are supposed to be evaluating things objectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| It avoids appearance of impropriety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| and I understand the motivation behind that type of regulation, and yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| I just wanted to say thank you, Ms. Keith, for your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| I have worked with you, and though we haven't always been on the same side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| you are a person of good character, and you do have the ability to call balls and strikes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| and I do appreciate you having the willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| Any other commissioners have anything for Ms. Keith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| Thank you, Ms. Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| And we will see you on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Our next applicant is John Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| If you would please approach the podium, state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4897)|
| 1:21:42| and anything you would like to tell Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| Good afternoon, members of County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| My name is John Valiant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| I live in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| I appreciate your time, and thank you for your consideration today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| I was not made aware of this current position until very late in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| That's why I did not apply for the first round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| It's my understanding that you've already been through one round of voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| and heard from several very qualified candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| Upon learning of this position and discussing it with several people who are very close to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| I felt I could make a positive impact and decided to submit my application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| So in preparing for today, I've read through the policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| and asked many individuals what would make a great candidate for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| I heard many things to include the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| The purpose is to set forth and enforce a structured set of rules and guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| to favorably influence the professionalism of law enforcement in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| through fair hiring, promotion, and management practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| and to protect law enforcement personnel from coercion or loss of employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| because of political activities of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| To effectively do this, you must look at everything with unbiased eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| You must demonstrate you are a good listener and that you can implement fairness and balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| Every scenario is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| Politics must be kept out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| You must protect the employees, and you must follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| This all requires critical thinking, good judgment, and strong moral character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| I come before you today not because I believe anybody from the board currently lacks these qualities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| or because I believe any of my fellow applicants lack these qualities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| However, I believe that I can bring an attitude and a skill set to this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| that would create a positive impact on the current board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| and help to achieve all of the objectives of the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| So I'd like to touch on a few of those skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| For one, I believe I can bring a legal perspective to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| that can help when there are questions of law or interpretation of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| I don't believe there is a sitting member of the board that is an attorney currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| and I believe that that perspective could be one of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Second, I believe I can bring a youthful perspective to the role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| We have so many great leaders in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| but so few individuals from my age bracket come forward with a willingness to serve their community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| and I believe that a youthful perspective would provide some balance and provide a diverse board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| I bring a positive attitude and an unmatched work ethic to all challenges and roles I take on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| For example, in the first three months of work post-law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| I've implemented many technological changes in our law firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| and I've reduced the cost of office supplies in our office by somewhere between 20 and 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| I'm very process-oriented, and I search for structure when there is a lack of such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| I also look for opportunities at every turn and always seek to understand, ask questions, and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| For example, in leading up to this interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| I reached out to many individuals, including past members of the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| to gain their perspective on what success in this role looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| I strongly believe that these qualities will create a positive impact on the current Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| Let me be clear that I wish to approach this with an open mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| and I understand that the purpose is to protect the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| and that's what I hope to accomplish by applying to this position today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| Thank you again for your time this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| and I hope that you will give me all of the consideration you can for this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| Mr. Valiant, I appreciate you coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| I also appreciate that, like I said in other positions with ethics and with the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| that we are having some new faces come in and want to serve our committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5124)|
| 1:25:30| It is very important, as I had stated to Ms. Keith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| that the new member understands that the role of a Merit Council member is to definitely protect the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5136)|
| 1:25:45| I believe that you do understand that from what you've read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| I do like the fact that you have the legal experience that I do believe is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| As this Merit Council, and I just want to remind the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| as this Merit Council is going through a lot of changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| a lot of rules are going to be adopted and that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| I think it's going to be extremely important for the Merit Council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| and for Ms. Taylor and her staff to have that legal expertise also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5167)|
| 1:26:15| So that is important to me, and I stated that last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| As I talked to Ms. Keith about retention and bringing new officers on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| do you have any ideas of some things that you could implement on the Merit Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| that might be positive reinforcements for our officers that maybe we have not been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5190)|
| 1:26:36| as we need to kind of think outside the box right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| Certainly. Well, I'd first like to say I think it would be pretty foolish to come into the position with an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| I want to really come in on day one, if given the opportunity, and come with an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5207)|
| 1:26:54| I'm not searching to change anything right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| I really want to understand what processes are in place first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| and get a better understanding of how things are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| However, in talking to some of the current members and some of the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| it's my understanding that communication with the officers currently is a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| and I believe that it's also, you know, I think officer recognition is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| I know some of the things that Ms. Keith touched upon, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| she said that a lot of these individuals are not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| they don't show up to this position with expecting a tremendous salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| and really they do it to serve their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| I think that one of the important things that we need to do is to recognize those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| And so without knowing exactly what policies are in place right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| I would suggest something to the effect of, you know, recognizing these officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| and providing some sort of reward as the name, you know, merit system would suggest we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| or some sort of at the very least recognition or, you know, on maybe a monthly basis potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| But once again, without knowing all of the current policies in place that they currently implement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| I think it would be foolish for me to suggest anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| Perfect. Thank you again for your willingness to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| Thank you, Commissioner Oster. Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| Mr. Valiant, how long, I have several questions, how long have you been practicing law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| I've not been practicing law. I just passed the bar last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5307)|
| 1:28:31| And assuming all goes well this week, I'll get licensed on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| That's a huge accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| So there's three attorneys then that have applied for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| What do you consider would set you apart that you would be more qualified for this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| One of the things I think I slightly touched on earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| I think we have a lack of youthful perspective in our current leadership positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| And I don't mean that to be disrespectful in any way towards anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| I just think there are a lot of individuals that are not willing to step up or afraid to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| and serve in positions that could be, you know, that would be good leadership roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5349)|
| 1:29:17| You know, I think that it's important to serve in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| and I think it's important to be able to stand up and not only protect individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| as this role would suggest, but to serve those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| So, you know, I think that there are three other candidates, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5374)|
| 1:29:41| there are three candidates total that do have some degree of legal experience to include myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5381)|
| 1:29:46| But I think that my experience comes from a youthful perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| Additionally, as my resume would state, this is not my first career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| I did have a brief career in business where I managed several different categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| and worked with several different people in a corporate environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| And I think that that experience could also lend well to this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| which might distinguish me slightly without knowing the other candidates' exact resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5405)|

| 1:31:02| Is there anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| I know one of the sections talks about promoting just and equitable incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5465)|
| 1:31:13| And in reading through the Merit Council policies, just this is a brief note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| I'm not going to go into the exact statistics, but there was a lot of negative language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| And I think that bringing – I'd like to bring a more positive perspective to this role if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5482)|
| 1:31:29| I think that there are a lot of really capable men and women that serve our police force now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5489)|

| 1:31:41| And in reading through the policies, it did not appear to me that there were a ton of opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5501)|
| 1:31:49| or a ton of avenues with which to recognize those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| And I think that would be – just to touch on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5512)|

| 1:37:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| Seeing as I think we've got two or three on this about easements, purchasing easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| I just want to know the process, how we come up to value that land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| and then if they don't want to sell, I see that in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| that we will be giving you the authority to acquire through intimate domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| So that's just what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| Be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| Items 30 and 31 are very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| We're required by ordinance to obtain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| anytime the county acquires property for a public improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| the acquisitions have to be approved by this body prior to doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| And on item 30, there's six tracks of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| There's a total of 0.18 acres in total, so it's really less than two-tenths of an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| and about a half an acre of temporary construction and slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| temporary slope and construction easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| We spoke to all six of these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| We don't anticipate necessarily any issues, but obviously those can arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| So once you all, or if you do all, decide to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| my department will consult with a licensed appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| That appraiser will look at the plans and establish a couple of different values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| the value of the land that we're acquiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| as well as the value of any damages to the remainder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| which in this case we're not necessarily, these are smaller acquisitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| so that may not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| But like if the road gets really close to a home when it previously wasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| obviously that house is diminished in value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| so the appraiser looks at that in addition to the value of just the hard cost of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| I did some rough numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| I would think this one would probably be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| the total acquisition of six tracks would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $25,000 or $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| But we do follow TDOT guidelines for acquisitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| so we have an appraiser do the appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| We have another appraisal do the appraisal review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| and then we have another individual do negotiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| so you have separation of services to avoid any kind of collusion or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| So that's the process, and we've been following that process for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| And this particular item, these acquisitions are budgeted for also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5977)|
| 1:39:47| Thank you, Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Any other commissioners have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6000)|

| 1:40:03| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6004)|

| 1:40:29| Madam Clerk, or Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| do these have to be moved forward with no recommendation because they're land acquisitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| or can they be moved to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| I just noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| They can be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| Okay, motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6039)|

| 1:43:00| I'd like to make – oh, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| I'd like to make a motion to move this forward without any recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| Motion is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6188)|

| 1:43:12| Motion made by Commissioner Lee with a second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| You have the floor, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| The reason why I put this on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| Halstead Powell currently has three members on their utility board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| The board is regulated by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| This commission doesn't have any authority over the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| but this is a first step in the process to expand it legislatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6215)|
| 1:43:41| and I'm working with the legislative body to get legislation made that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| when enabled to expand this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| due to the increase of the population of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| and the Halstead Powell being $67 million in debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| the community feels like we need more representation in District 7 for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| So this is – I put this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| This is just the first step, and ultimately it will go to Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| and the legislators will determine whether they can get a bill passed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6253)|
| 1:44:20| Thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| I was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| I asked to have this pulled because I have one or two questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| that I need clarification on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| Is the bill that's going to come, or this might be a law director question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| the bill that you want to have happen at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| does that not have to affect all utilities in the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| Or is this – you can just answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| This is – the language will specifically say just Knox County, what services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| Halstead Powell, not other utility companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| And that's allowed at the state level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| They aren't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| They don't all have to be underneath the same guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| That was my main question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| Then are you worried that – I talked to my utility people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| They say each member costs them about $20,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6306)|
| 1:45:12| It's $300 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| That's their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| I mean, there's salary, there's benefits, there's travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| there's all the training that they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| They said about $20,000 a year per person is what it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| Yours might be different from mine, but mine said roughly around –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| so you're adding more of a financial burden onto a struggling –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| are you concerned about that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| No, I don't believe that that's the figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| And looking at the numbers of what they're paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| it's legislatively decided that they get $300 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| And in looking at the financial statement, it is not $20,000 per member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6350)|
| 1:45:56| But it would be important to the district to have the representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| by a bigger body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| I'm not saying that they get paid the $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| I'm saying between what they get paid, their benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| and all their training and travel, that that total number is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| So that would be $60,000 a year that you're adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| to a financially burdened utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| Do you understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| Yeah, I get you what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| but I don't believe that that's what it's cost in Hallsdale County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| The head of Hallsdale, Powell, what's their –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| Darren Hardwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| Have you talked to him about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| I have, and I did speak with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| and he did not have any opposition to increasing the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| And does he plan on being here next week at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| I haven't talked to him since I put it on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| but I have spoken to him about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| That answers my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Because Hallsdale, Powell Utility covers parts of Anderson and Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| is it your effort to increase the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| to include members from Anderson County and Union County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| The Anderson and Union County part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| they're still governed by the same board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| but this bill would not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| and speaking with the legislative people who are working on it in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| it would not change anything in regards to Union County or Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6444)|
| 1:47:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| Do they have representation on the board now then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| No, they do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| There's three members that represent all three counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| but I mean they're all from Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| And then Tennessee Code Annotated 7-82-604| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6462)|
| 1:47:49| says that a state-chartered utility has to have three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| So what you're going to be asking for from the Knoxville delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| is a private act to have this utility only have more than three commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6477)|
| 1:48:07| Actually, that act, it can have up to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| So there's not a requirement three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| There are other utility districts that have more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| So I'm just asking to expand this one to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| But are any of those utility districts in Knox County that have seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| Not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| Commissioner Daley, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| Commissioner Lee, does this, what's in the statute now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6517)|
| 1:48:43| they can go up to seven already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| Yes, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| And why are we doing this for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| They can go already all the way to seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| So, you know, I think that, have you talked to the comptroller to do an audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6532)|
| 1:48:58| I think your first step would be to go to comptroller and let him check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| and see what's going on and get the actual facts before we do something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| Senator Briggs is working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| and that was what was suggested that we get the approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| basically that Knox County doesn't disapprove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| And then it has to go to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| And so this would not circumvent any kind of audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| that this would be a better representation for the management and the rates in Hallsdale Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6567)|
| 1:49:33| It's my understanding that if something was to be found or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| the state can put them out of business and KUB can take them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| So I think we might be putting the cart before the horse right here until we research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6583)|
| 1:49:50| We might want to research that with Dr. Briggs to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| But if you can already do seven, this doesn't really mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| But if it's $67 million, it's a lot to be in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| So I would want to know why I'm in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| Knox Chapman, luckily we're only about, which runs great with three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| we're only about seven to nine million in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| Well, we can't automatically do the seven without legislative approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| and this is just the first start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| But nothing is going to happen until we do something to address the $67 million debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6625)|
| 1:50:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6632)|
| 1:50:37| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Madam Chair, this is just a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| In your resolution, you're saying that the legislative delegations of Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| and Union Counties would also have to join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| Have they already been notified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| or do you have a resolution before that that they're going to introduce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| Didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| They're not required to join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| This would not affect them any differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| So we're not speaking on behalf of Union County or Anderson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| we're just in the part of Knox County where Hallsdale Powell has service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6672)|
| 1:51:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| So nothing would change for Union County or Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6680)|
| 1:51:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| On Section 2 here, you say to further this goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| the commissioner would urge the Knox County legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| along with the legislative delegations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| are you speaking of the Nashville legislative delegations of Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| and Union Counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| Is that what you're referring to in your resolution here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6704)|
| 1:51:52| I would have to ask the law director that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| Can you pull up page 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| It's the third paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| It's got the Roman numeral 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| are you saying that the legislative delegations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| meaning the county commissions of Anderson and Union Counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| or are you referring to their Nashville legislative delegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6741)|

| 1:52:25| Ultimately, Nashville makes the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6745)|
| 1:52:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| Which all the other entities that have gone to 7 have had a private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| because it is not in statute that you can automatically go to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| Seeing none, the motion is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6783)|

| 1:53:20| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6800)|
| 1:53:26| Can I ask a quick question about that real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| Can I ask a question real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| Can we clarify that you're asking for a private act next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| Can you put that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| That's where my confusion was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| that you're trying to change the stature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| not do your own separate private act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| Is that language in the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| Did I miss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| Well, this body can't do the act itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| It's just this body is just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| You're encouraging for a private act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| not to change the actual stature, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| Can we clarify that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| Yeah, amend it for next week, you being the author?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| It's not a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| It's just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| Well, the way it's wrote is what is required for us to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| to the legislators in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| So I'd have to ask the law director if that's going to affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6862)|
| 1:54:27| Whatever Dr. Briggs says, if he's sponsoring it over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| whatever he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6872)|
| 1:54:59| If Dr. Briggs is the one that's sponsoring this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| he's got to put it in the hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| Somebody will put something in the hopper the way you want it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| and if you're working with him, he'll put it in the hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| Generally, they go in next month in the hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| And then normally what happens is if there's one in the hopper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| this body will say, we support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| and it goes to our delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| So this is kind of a form of that that you're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| I would like to keep it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| That's your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| I'd like to keep it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| But just for clarification, Commissioner Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| will you see how many utility districts in the state of Tennessee has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| gone from three to five or seven in your research next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| I do have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| I don't have it right with me, but I do have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| Or you can send it to Drew, and Drew can send it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| Moving on, Madam Clerk, our next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| This is item number 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| consideration of a resolution of the commission urging state funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| for a mental health hospital in Knox County, resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6979)|
| 1:56:27| Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| Motion to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| with a second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| Commissioner Ward actually pulled this from consent because I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| contacted by several commissioners about potentially being added as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| full commission as a sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| and I just wanted to make sure you were willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| I think we definitely need a long-term mental health facility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| I know we've talked about it for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| It used to reside in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| It closed down about 10-plus years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| So I think our county would really be served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| And right now the sheriff's, you know, the prison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| the county jail is acting as the largest mental health facility in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7029)|
| 1:57:13| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| So we definitely need some relief there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| I just want to encourage all of our commissioners to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| whether you were here on commission or you're new to the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| to go back to, you can find it on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| and then I'm going to ask Drew to send it out via the agenda and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| CTV recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| Monday, May 9th, 2022 of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| we held a joint workshop with both the city council and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| And it was entirely about this topic of mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| And it was a really substantial meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| And I think one of the most important parts of it was the presentation by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| Marie Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| the commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Substance Abuse Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| where she outlined significant, you know, resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7082)|
| 1:58:09| what's being done, acknowledging there's still much more to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| but we've, while I agree with Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| that we do need a permanent publicly funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7097)|
| 1:58:21| publicly accessible mental health hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| And that's different because you have other mental health hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| but are only if you have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| But she did a really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| really excellent job presenting since the day of Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| what has happened, what has been invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| And it's a precursor to great. Now what's the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| It was a wealth of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| It was probably one of the most substantial meetings that I've been to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| from a content perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| So I'll just ask Drew if she might both send out the agenda and the CTV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7128)|
| 1:58:53| recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7133)|
| 1:58:54| I encourage you to just watch that and pay attention to the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| This is a huge need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| We are worked really hard to do an assessment of the mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| situation in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| We're amplifying that this year with the health of our health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| and other partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| I think this is a really opportune time to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| to get in front of our legislators, ask them to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| to really focus on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| If in outlined in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| if you are somebody that needs public mental health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| And you are in a clinical state where you must be hospitalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| the sheriff's department literally has to put you in a car and drive you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| to Chattanooga or more often Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| Imagine having somebody in a mental health crisis state being put into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| police car and driven six hours to get help in that kind of environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| and that kind of situation and how much that might amplify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| So we are Knox County is the regional hub for all of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| Northeast Tennessee when it comes to mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| And I think that this is more than appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| I hope our state legislative delegation will take it seriously and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| focus on what is the next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| I appreciate the investment that's been made to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| I appreciate our mayor and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| and this commission for investing in what we've done so far, but let's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| let's keep moving on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| This is not an issue that's going to go away and we have to sort of keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| the gas pedal down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| So thank you Drew in advance for setting that information up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| Director Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| I feel like I want to chime in because 10 years ago when they shut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| Lakeshore to put in a park up there, they didn't make anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| The state didn't make anything to do with the people up there and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7240)|
| 2:00:44| problems that Lakeshore was dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| They promised us two and a half million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| We had a committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| Good people on the committee, commissioners, Randy Nichols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| who was the AG or had just gotten off as the AG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| was the contact over there and I'll never forget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| we sat up here at that meeting wanting to do and talk about the 2.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| million and how much we were going to put in to get this taken care of so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| these people didn't get drug off to the jail or taken off to Moccasin Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| And he came in and he was white, just shaking white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| And he said, ladies and gentlemen, I've just got back from Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| and the governor's office said there is no money there for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| for a mental health center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| So that's just very strong in my mind because I believe very strongly in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| although I'm not a policy maker, but it's been a long time coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| and I just thought you ought to know that the state cut off what we had over at Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| and we haven't gotten anything from them like they promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| Thank you, Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| Please let the record state that this will now be from full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| Motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| This is item 46, resolution 904, a resolution of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7342)|
| 2:02:28| approving a ground lease with Concord Yacht Club, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| for recreational activities for a term of 10 years beginning July 1, 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7351)|
| 2:02:38| and ending June 30, 2033 with the option to renew the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| for an additional period of 10 years with an annual rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| in the amount of $1,000 over the initial term of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7371)|
| 2:02:57| Motion to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| with a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7380)|
| 2:03:03| Is there any discussion on this item, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| I was just going to say that the mayor and members of his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| were at the facility this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| and two commissioners are scheduled this week to visit the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7394)|
| 2:03:19| And, of course, the mayor's team can arrange a meeting if you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| to see the property prior to next Monday's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| I see Mr. Vander Veidt swaying back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| Did you want to make a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7414)|
| 2:03:41| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| I just would ask that it be moved without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| until Commissioner Schoonmaker and Commissioner Frazier have completed their visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| But if anybody else would like to go, they would love for you to see the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| They struggle with a bit of an identity issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| It is called the Concord Yacht Club, but it fundamentally really is a sailing club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7436)|
| 2:04:01| It's a non-profit to provide sailing instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| with an emphasis on youth sailing instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| because they want to promote the longevity and sustainability of sailing activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7448)|
| 2:04:14| So they'd be delighted to have anybody else that wants to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| And if you'd like to, please just give me a shout tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| The only caveat would be if you were going to go on a day and time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| when one of your peers was going, we might butt up against the notice requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7465)|
| 2:04:29| But other than that, we'd be pleased to facilitate the visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7469)|
| 2:04:35| Thank you, sir. Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| Who does this accommodate, the Yacht Club?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7480)|
| 2:04:47| There are a number of boat owners that maintain boats there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| and then they support various local youth organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| that are active in sailing and a couple sailing clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| Beyond that, I'm not really as ready and as perhaps Director Mack is on the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| but he's been out there repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| And again, Commissioner, we'd be glad to facilitate a visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| They feel like they struggle from a bit of an identity crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| because they're named the Yacht Club, but there are no actual yachts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| I guess my question is, you said it accommodates clubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| but is this open to all youth in Knox County or just a certain people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7525)|
| 2:05:32| Oh, no, all youth in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| I think they work with scouting organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| Anybody that has an interest in sailing, they're anxious to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7537)|
| 2:05:43| It's a nonprofit that exists to, again, promote the sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| and viability of sailing as a youth sport or as a sport in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| So no exclusivity, no geographic parameters, nothing of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7550)|
| 2:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| Thank you, Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Commissioner Jay, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| I'll just add that I know several different youth groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| and children that have gone to like summer camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| They work with Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| They also have those camps open to everyone, do scholarships at those camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| Boy Scouts troops are very active there as well, at least from my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| I just had a question for you, Mr. Vandreda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7583)|
| 2:06:27| Was there a previous lease of a certain period of time that expired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| or was there never a lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| I mean, is this new or is there a precedent we're working on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| There was a previous lease, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| It has been out there for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| This is an updated version of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| One concern I had expressed to me from a couple commissioners was the term of the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7605)|
| 2:06:52| and we did suggest that five and five was a good alternative to ten and ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| unless the organization intends to put a lot of capital dollars into facility improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| and they need time to recover those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| And I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| Ten years is a pretty good stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| So when this comes back next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| we would think that five and five might be under discussion as a more reasonable lease term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| So does Knox County own the building or just the property itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| Ultimately, that would probably be a deed research and a question for Mr. Boot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| because the property conveyed to the county from TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| as part of the conveyance of all the Concord Park facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| and I would assume then that improvements to it probably belong to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7651)|
| 2:07:37| If the county ceases using it for recreational purposes, does it revert to TVA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| It gets into some pretty complicated space because all that stuff dates back to the early 1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| Last question, is there any other lease that we can look at that would have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7667)|
| 2:07:55| whether it's on the shoreline or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| I mean, are there other similar things like this where Knox County owns the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7677)|
| 2:08:02| but yet leases that we can sort of compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| I think maybe some concern would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| is somebody using Knox County land and then profiting in a certain way that is exclusive or isn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| We know this one isn't, but is there something else we can kind of compare to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| that Knox County has leased to another private entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| We'll be glad to look into that between now and next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| It's not a great parallel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7706)|
| 2:08:27| The only thing I can think of, we do have a concessionaire at the Cove River Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| leases kayaks out of there and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| but I think very clearly we own the building and the physical plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| But we will ask around between now and next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7724)|
| 2:08:45| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7726)|
| 2:08:47| I must have missed a public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| When is the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| It's individuals going on their own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| There's not a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| So I'll call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7738)|
| 2:08:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7739)|
| 2:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| Seeing none, the motion is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7753)|
| 2:09:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| Madam Clerk, our next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| This is Ordinance's first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| This is Ordinance 0-22-10-101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| Ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| updating and amending the Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| Entire Personnel Plan to provide for various improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| to the personnel plan of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| Ordinance 0-16-8-101, adopted September 26, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7780)|

| 2:09:54| And Ordinance 0-19-3-101, adopted April 22, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7794)|
| 2:10:02| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| Motion to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| with a second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| I see Director Candler is in the room, if we have any questions for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7822)|
| 2:10:31| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| If you could take a moment to kind of summarize what prompted this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| Was this general housekeeping or any particular thing that warranted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7837)|
| 2:10:42| why you're doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| Let's go ahead and update X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| Sure, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7845)|
| 2:10:46| Stephanie Candler, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| We basically want to get the personnel plan reviewed on the election cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| so that with each eight-year term we're looking at it every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7854)|
| 2:10:59| The last time it was done was 2019, and we made updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| We made a few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| There's three probably that have some impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7865)|
| 2:11:11| but overall it's just language clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| where throughout the years we've referred to the handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| and we've had people say that doesn't sound right or make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| and so we've just clarified a lot of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| And then the purpose for the ordinance was there were some laws broken out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| in the ordinance in a very specific manner that may change at the federal level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| over the next four years, so we simplified that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7891)|
| 2:11:35| so we don't overstate or understate the law in our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| Can you also outline what this personnel plan, who this covers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7899)|
| 2:11:45| Because I think the general public may assume that all Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| are covered under the same personnel plan, which I know is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| Yeah, this is the executive branch handbook personnel plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| and there is a statement in the statute that basically says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7918)|
| 2:12:04| other elected offices can adopt their own personnel plans, which some have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| And so anyone that adopts ours, this would pertain to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| but if someone chooses to adopt their own, then they have the right to do so at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| Is there any more discussion for this item? Thank you, Director Candler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| Seeing none, the motion is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| Those opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| Item number 48 is Ordinance O-22-10-102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7967)|
| 2:12:50| amending the Knox County Code, Chapter 46, Article 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7970)|
| 2:12:54| entitled County Governmental Library, to place the duties of the Knox County Governmental Library Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| with the Personnel Committee of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7980)|
| 2:13:04| This is Ordinance O-90-9-121, adopted September 10, 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7984)|
| 2:13:09| and Ordinance O-92-5-105, adopted July 27, 1992.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7989)|
| 2:13:15| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| Since this is mine, I will make the motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| It's a motion by Commissioner Durrett with a second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| Commissioners, it's almost like the Personnel Committee couldn't come too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8008)|
| 2:13:34| Here we have arrived at another instance to where a specific body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8014)|
| 2:13:44| in this case the Governmental Library, is a small one-person department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8024)|
| 2:13:49| that should be under the purview of the County Commission Personnel Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| because the current language references a Governmental Library committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8034)|
| 2:13:59| made up of every judge in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8039)|
| 2:14:04| After talking with Chancellor Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8044)|
| 2:14:07| we can't find any records that this committee has met in the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8047)|
| 2:14:14| So it would be difficult to impossible to get all these judges together to hold a meeting on this department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8054)|
| 2:14:20| and obviously is not a great use of their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| So the cleanest approach is to put this law library underneath the direction of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8064)|
| 2:14:32| and specifically the Personnel Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| And so that's what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| This is basically a language cleanup to make sure we don't just have somebody floating out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8076)|
| 2:14:40| like we have found with Merritt and other instances like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8080)|
| 2:14:50| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| I would like to say I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| I deal with this library almost on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| and a lot of the time the Internet does not even work and there's no one to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8100)|
| 2:15:07| So I would support this going under the Personnel Committee for accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8107)|
| 2:15:13| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8116)|
| 2:15:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8120)|
| 2:15:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| And that motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8127)|
| 2:15:35| Item number 50, discussion item on establishing a high school civics program junior commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8135)|
| 2:15:44| Commissioner Jay, do you recognize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| My fellow commissioners, I would like to essentially float a balloon to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| and an idea that I've been working on for some time with the idea that to gather some feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| and then with your approval make it a more permanent idea going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8158)|
| 2:16:05| I have an idea for establishing a junior commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| This would be a civic-minded program with the purpose of engaging the next generation of young leaders in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8169)|
| 2:16:15| I think we've had many discussions about civics and about engaging people in the public service realm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8175)|
| 2:16:23| and about how important it is for every future generation to get involved with their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| And so I sort of found a couple of models of this around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8189)|
| 2:16:34| and one description really outlined it very closely to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| This is a youth commission or a junior commission to actively involve youth in policy issues affecting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| broadening the scope of youth leadership in our affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| promote experiential learning of the functions of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| develop healthy citizenry habits for the future of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8211)|
| 2:16:54| and promote public awareness of the strengths and the abilities of our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| So here's how I would envision it, and then I'll open the floor and start the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8219)|
| 2:17:06| I would envision starting it in 2023 and making it an annual program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8226)|
| 2:17:11| whereby each commissioner would name one student from their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| or in the at-large seat aspect in the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8235)|
| 2:17:22| Those students would be either a junior or senior enrolled in a public, private, or homeschooling program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8242)|
| 2:17:28| and run it roughly January to March of each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| whereby junior commissioners would be recognized as a class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| and then participate in at least a workshop, a commission meeting, committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| and maybe even a public event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| We would need to program that appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| but some sort of taste of each of the elements of what we do as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| The application process either could be coordinated through the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| or left up to the commissioners individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| That would be a little bit to be determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| but certainly I've already talked to Drew and the commission office about helping coordinate this to some extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8278)|
| 2:18:04| which they're very welcome to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| It could conclude after a certain number of those months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8286)|
| 2:18:11| with a meal recognition in a formal way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| maybe a program in the small assembly meeting our mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| other elected officials doing a little bit of an orientation of the government as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8298)|
| 2:18:23| If interested, I would formalize this idea, bring it back in November to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8303)|
| 2:18:29| and then begin the implementation of it in December and January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| Essentially, I think it's a pretty low threshold for our participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8312)|
| 2:18:37| for the amount of effort it would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| It wouldn't be any fiscal note on it except for if we were to sponsor a meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8319)|
| 2:18:44| which I'm sure we could even get that sponsored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| But open to the ideas, thoughts, suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| just trying to find a way that each year we can all reach out to our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| bring somebody alongside of us for a taste of what it means to be a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8333)|
| 2:18:57| and maybe inspire the next generation to think of public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| and think of their role in that public service as something that's quite important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8341)|
| 2:19:07| With that, I'd just love to hear if anybody has any thoughts or comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| and then move forward, or if nobody likes the idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| then tell me that too and we'll not move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| I didn't know, will you expect to partner with any other organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| to help facilitate this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| I think I'd be certainly open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| I did talk to the folks at Leadership Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| They do a youth leadership program that is more across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| and I did get some ideas and feedback and pointers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| I think we would put out the awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| I just don't know if it's necessary to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| okay, in cooperation with X organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| because I'm trying to keep it very simple to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8388)|
| 2:19:52| I think it's something we can do on our own, but I think as commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| we would want to put out, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| if we didn't formalize the application process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| you could reach out to organizations in your district and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8400)|
| 2:20:05| hey, for the month of December, I've got this essay question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| or this contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8410)|
| 2:20:11| Who wants to be the junior commissioner of 2023 for District 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8411)|
| 2:20:15| And you could reach out to the partner organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| or we could do it a bit more formal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| So I hadn't really thought through that in specificity yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8423)|
| 2:20:24| What comes to mind is I've been working with the Institute of Public Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| a part of UT, and this is something right up their alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| of trying to get more youth engaged in civics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8431)|
| 2:20:36| I would certainly welcome a co-coordinator on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| to help me with this, Ms. Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8442)|
| 2:20:48| Commissioner Lundy, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| Commissioner Jay, I'm glad you brought this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| because actually last month I spoke with the education outreach coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| for Knox County about doing something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| and even spoke with Director Buch last month about the legalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| of if we did have high schoolers shadowing us at a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| to what extent could they participate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| And, you know, the way I kind of envisioned doing something like this, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| because, you know, this is high school government teacher coming out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8482)|
| 2:21:25| is having them shadow us for a work session and then a voting session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8485)|
| 2:21:33| and potentially a committee here and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| I have kind of hesitation with that just due to the scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| of most of them being during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| Maybe we could get that approved one day for them to miss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| because it is a specific program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8505)|
| 2:21:50| But just to keep it with that shorter timeline and then afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| they could potentially come in and run their own session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8515)|
| 2:21:59| with us sitting beside them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| I think that would be great ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| and I did envision at some point in some way that they would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8524)|
| 2:22:08| literally occupy the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| We've got enough room to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| I think that we could work through some of the logistics of how that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| and the permissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8535)|
| 2:22:16| I'm sure there's some legality waivers that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| by participating in this you will do X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| I'm sure we could work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| And I do think that we could work with different social studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| or other professors for, you know, if there's extra credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| or things that they could do to apply for grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| One other factor I did when I sort of polled various teachers that I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8554)|
| 2:22:39| across the county, all of them said, you know, January, February, March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| that's a good dead time, but by the time you get past March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| like you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8567)|
| 2:22:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| And so the fall was really tough and the spring was really tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| so it seemed to fit in that three-month window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| So I think we could do, you know, a welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| and then commission a work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| and then the next month is maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| the committee or some special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| and then the last one is maybe the voting session or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| We could work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| And I'd be happy to call a meeting where we could all just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| brainstorm in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8589)|
| 2:23:10| I guess what I was looking for tonight is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| does enough of this body think it's a worthy endeavor to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| and then put some more time into it, or if not, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| Oh, I think 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| I'll put some dates out there to schedule a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| Maybe we can just go upstairs and brainstorm and work through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| and then put it into a resolution and formalize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8607)|
| 2:23:31| And so be thinking about how in December you might put out the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8611)|
| 2:23:36| and pick your junior commissioner to be our 2023 class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8616)|
| 2:23:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8621)|
| 2:23:45| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| Item number 51, discussion item regarding the commission retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| It's that time again, friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| We need to come up with suggestions, times, dates for a commission retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8635)|
| 2:24:03| and, of course, volunteers to facilitate and plan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8643)|
| 2:24:09| Commissioner Hill and I did it in April, March or April of 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8649)|
| 2:24:16| and I enjoyed it, but it's time to pass the torch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8656)|
| 2:24:24| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| I did the first one, so I'm out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| It's not terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| I actually enjoyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| I had a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| Well, it's also what I do, though, so it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| Anyone willing to do it now, or do I need to put out a request for that later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8677)|
| 2:24:46| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8686)|
| 2:24:47| I'm willing to have a discussion to learn more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| There's a fairly good framework from the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| I ran it for the first two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| and then I think you all ran it the last time we did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| so there's some good framework of how we pulled it off, when we pulled it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8699)|
| 2:25:04| We will be more than willing to have that discussion with you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| But I would like to see potential dates that works with everybody's schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| because, you know, we're getting into holidays, as Commissioner Jay said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| Maybe January, February, early March is dead time, and then it picks back up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| So just be thinking about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| How many days you would like, one, two, time during the week, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8729)|
| 2:25:36| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| Madam Chair, is there some thought that we always scramble every year to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| when we're going to meet with our state delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| and it always seems to sort of happen right before they go into session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| which is always a hard time for them, but we've got to get to them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| That's the second Tuesday of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| So I wonder, backing up from that, it's between now and the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8756)|
| 2:26:01| Are you thinking we would do them both at the same time, or totally separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8761)|
| 2:26:11| That's a great something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| Commissioner Lee, I saw your light next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| I was just wondering how long the retreat is and where is it hosted at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| The retreat that Commissioner Hill and I hosted was Thursday and Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8784)|
| 2:26:30| at the Bearden Banquet Hall from 8.30 to 4.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8790)|
| 2:26:37| During the week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8797)|
| 2:26:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| I think the first one we did was Friday, Saturday, and we went to Thursday, Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| We're open to suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| It could be a single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| It's just really the content we wanted to cover we felt was two days worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8808)|
| 2:26:53| So it's really up to the person organizing the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| I'll yield to Commissioner Oster if your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8821)|
| 2:27:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| Madam Chair is ignoring me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8826)|
| 2:27:09| No, I think I'll be interested in helping plan it also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| since there's already kind of a framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| So I just thought I would put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| I was saving the best for last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| No offense, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| I would enthusiastically nominate Commissioners Frazier and Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8844)|
| 2:27:29| No, I would just suggest reach out to Senator Massey as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8849)|
| 2:27:35| because I agree with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| It's been hard to pull off, but the earlier the better that we can meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8857)|
| 2:27:43| Personally, I would hesitate to try to do that and a retreat between now and Christmas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8863)|
| 2:27:48| but, you know, just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| We will try to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| Any other discussion regarding commission retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8875)|
| 2:28:01| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| Item number 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8884)|
| 2:28:12| This is 8-C-22-RC, request of Benjamin C. Mullins for rezoning from PC plan commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8892)|
| 2:28:20| to PR plan residential up to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| property located at 0 Palestine Lane, parcel ID 141079, part of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8904)|
| 2:28:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8914)|
| 2:28:35| This zoning item is actually in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| and so I just wanted to bring it to your attention that hopefully between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| and next Monday night you can have an opportunity to run by and see this property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8922)|
| 2:28:49| It's at the Watt Road and I-4175 exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8929)|
| 2:28:55| When you go south on Watt Road, the first driveway to your left is Palestine Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8935)|
| 2:29:02| That's right in front of the Petro Travel Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8942)|
| 2:29:06| The next business in is actually one that I helped coordinate to get some things resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8946)|
| 2:29:13| because it was kind of zoned for industrial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8953)|
| 2:29:17| and that business is the Old Dominion Freight Lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8957)|
| 2:29:21| And then next to that is the Southeastern Freight Lines, a trucking company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8961)|
| 2:29:27| But if you follow Palestine Lane around to the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| you'll end up at the Rocky Top Marble and Granite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| And then if you look to your east, that's where the property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| So it's behind the ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| You'll be able to see where First Utility District's water tank is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8981)|
| 2:29:46| but you can kind of get a lay of the land, but just so you understand where this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8986)|
| 2:29:55| And one of the reasons that Old Dominion picked that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| was obviously the convenience to the interstate, and, you know, there's traffic in and out of there a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=8999)|
| 2:30:05| So I think you're going to get some e-mails from the community on that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| but it's better to get eyes on the ground before we meet next Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| So just wanted to bring that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9017)|
| 2:30:20| I want to remind everybody that it is Breast Cancer Awareness Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| and so if you could please next week wear some sort of pink in your attire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9024)|
| 2:30:32| Is there any more business to come before the Knox County Commission? Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| Early voting starts Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9036)|
| 2:30:39| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| Is there a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9047)|
| 2:30:50| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9050)|
| 2:30:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221017?start=9051)|
