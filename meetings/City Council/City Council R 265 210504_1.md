| 2:35:51| big point that Justice Knox recognized in the fact that at average city incomes are on the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9351)|
| 2:35:58| lower than our area median income as a whole. So really trying to emphasize serving households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9358)|
| 2:36:04| that fall at the lower scales of what is still an affordable program. So in that regard, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9364)|
| 2:36:12| minimum that is set is that 65 percent of our annual allocation of public funds has to be spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9372)|
| 2:36:18| such that they are benefiting households that are at or below that 60 percent line. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9378)|
| 2:36:22| the by code minimum floor to target funds at the highest need groups. Then there is again an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9382)|
| 2:36:28| intentionality to say, but you also must on an annual basis consider the proportion of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9388)|
| 2:36:34| funding and the rules to help guide your funding toward even lower portions of our population. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9394)|
| 2:36:40| targeting it to say 30 percent, 50 percent. So pushing us every year with the advisory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9400)|
| 2:36:46| to make intentional targets that push us to say here's how we are going to address the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9406)|
| 2:36:51| of our even lowest, extremely low, very low households in our community. So again, there's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| element of what's baked in and codified and then what is it forcing us to do without specifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9417)|
| 2:37:03| up front what those targets and what those numbers actually will be. I just wanted to clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9423)|
| 2:37:10| the HUD definition of extremely low income is 30 percent AMI and below. And I believe that 50 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9430)|
| 2:37:21| is progress. But I am worried about how it's written because the priority is the 60 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9441)|
| 2:37:30| and below, which is not extremely low income as defined by HUD. And we have seen projects come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9450)|
| 2:37:38| before us that are generally 60 percent, 80 percent AMI. And we continue to have a growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9458)|
| 2:37:47| crisis. The research that I've read has suggested that cities thought similar policies as the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9467)|
| 2:37:56| before us. And that's one reason why I'm so appreciative of all the hard work that went into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9476)|
| 2:38:03| bringing this ordinance forward. But we still have more work to do and there are improvements to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9483)|
| 2:38:09| in here to ensure that we have the focus on the extremely low income members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9489)|
| 2:38:16| that many experts recommend that you have. I like in here that there's a five-year period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9496)|
| 2:38:24| where we have a focus. For me, in my opinion, and based on my research, that five-year period should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9504)|
| 2:38:30| be focused on 30 percent income and below. And then beyond that, for the life of this fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9510)|
| 2:38:36| we should have parameters like what's in place here now. So I would hate to see us focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9516)|
| 2:38:43| on these goals for five years and not concentrate on the extremely low income that we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9523)|
| 2:38:52| that the experts say we need to, in order to really aggressively address an affordable housing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9532)|
| 2:39:00| in the way, in the manner that we need to aggressively address it. And so I will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9540)|
| 2:39:07| supporting this measure, but continuing to push not five years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9547)|
| 2:39:14| but on an annual basis that we make funding commitments through this fund and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9554)|
| 2:39:23| that seriously address the affordable housing crisis and the impact it's having on those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9563)|
| 2:39:30| our community with extremely low income. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Parker. Thank you, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9570)|
| 2:39:40| Any other questions or discussions? Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mayor. I want to thank Justice Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9580)|
| 2:39:48| and Councilman Fugate for the hard work that went into this. It's much easier to critique than to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9588)|
| 2:39:54| create, and it's thank you for bringing forward such a good ordinance for us to review, consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9594)|
| 2:40:00| and weigh heavily. I just want to applaud the flexibility that was described just now. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| that's extremely important because there will be new innovative ways for us to address affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| housing, and I think you've built that within it. And also it's important that we have oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9609)|
| 2:40:14| as a Council. So just one question is maybe for Deputy Gill. Will Council have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9614)|
| 2:40:22| to vote on the disbursement of these funds to contractors involved in any building associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9622)|
| 2:40:28| with this fund? Is that correct? Yeah, just as you would now, those contracts that would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| Council approval, which is anything over $25,000, which in this case is proven to be the norm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9633)|
| 2:40:39| would come before you. And so there will still be that oversight coming from Council. And in addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9639)|
| 2:40:46| again, a lot of the guidelines are developed collaboratively with the Office of Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9646)|
| 2:40:50| Collaboratively with the Affordable Housing Fund Committee, and those nominations would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9650)|
| 2:40:55| before Council. Okay, thank you. I think that oversight is really important, and for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| that are maybe new to the process, I think that's extremely important. I think it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| worth applauding the dedication to permanent supportive housing. That's an extremely successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9665)|
| 2:41:12| model that we've used here. Flinnican Landing is one in the First District that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9672)|
| 2:41:16| I just can't say enough about. It has permanent supportive housing with built-in social services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9676)|
| 2:41:23| to care for those folks who raise their hand and say, I need help, and it provides them stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9683)|
| 2:41:28| long term. So I'm really impressed with the accountability and the dedication of the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| for those as well. And I just want to add one more thing that we discussed last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9692)|
| 2:41:38| Justice Knox shows how it's possible to do really hard work in a collaborative way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| disagree well, and produce something that'll have impact for a long time. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9704)|
| 2:41:48| I can't applaud you all enough. The hard work towards justice that you put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9708)|
| 2:41:54| not just talking about it, you're acting on it. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9714)|
| 2:41:59| Thank you, Council Member Smith. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9723)|

| 2:42:15| 12E is an ordinance to amend Ordinance No. 0-107-2019, known and cited as the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9735)|

| 2:42:42| Council Member Singh. Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to talk about the neighborhood. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9762)|
| 2:42:47| really came together with a lot of concerns of the dangers on the road that this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9767)|
| 2:42:53| be constructed on and excess water. And I appreciate all the conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9773)|
| 2:43:02| And Mr. Cannon's not here, who was very helpful, as well as Deputy Brace. But once again, like Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9782)|
| 2:43:10| Smith was saying, Council Member Smith was saying, coming together and working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9790)|
| 2:43:15| and having the conversations to reach some sort of compromise really seemed to happen here. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9795)|
| 2:43:20| hope that continues on this project. Thank you, Council Member Singh. Any other questions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9800)|

| 2:44:46| Betsy Hobkirk. Ms. Hobkirk, would you please come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9886)|
| 2:44:54| Betsy Hobkirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| Okay. Is Ms. Ms. Hobkirk in the room? Okay, we'll move on to the next person, Elena Schuch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9896)|
| 2:45:13| If you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9913)|
| 2:45:17| and you have up to five minutes to address council. Elena Schuch, 3101 Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9917)|
| 2:45:22| I'd also like to echo earlier speakers who reflected that your pride in this budget really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9922)|
| 2:45:27| does show your values, but I happen to disagree with those values. So I'm currently pursuing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9927)|
| 2:45:32| Ph.D. in psychology at UT, and as a therapist in training, I regularly work with people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9932)|
| 2:45:37| are impacted by trauma, so I'd like to educate you a little bit on that. Our Diagnostic Manual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9937)|
| 2:45:42| for Mental Health Concerns defines trauma as exposure to actual or threatened death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9942)|
| 2:45:47| serious injury, or sexual violence, whether that's through your own experience, witnessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9947)|
| 2:45:51| or hearing about it happening to others, or repeat exposure, like constant police violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9951)|
| 2:45:56| in your community. When we're in danger, our bodies go into survival mode, and we're flooded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9956)|
| 2:46:00| with stress hormones that put us on high alert. This is an evolutionary adaptation from the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9960)|
| 2:46:06| when things like lions could hunt and kill us, and it allows us to react in the moment by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| for example, tensing our muscles to fight or flee. This is a really exhausting state to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9970)|
| 2:46:16| but when you experience trauma regularly, that just becomes your permanent reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9976)|
| 2:46:20| Part of healing from trauma is reaching a place of relative safety, both physically and within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| yourself. But how do you expect our Black community to heal from the trauma of their daily existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9985)|
| 2:46:31| when the racist structures that you put in place never stop traumatizing them? How can you expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9991)|
| 2:46:37| people to move on with their lives when each day might bring some fresh hell, like police invading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=9997)|
| 2:46:43| your home for a raid, or fearing for your life when a cop pulls you over, or learning that your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=10003)|
| 2:46:50| brother or friend or daughter or lover can be murdered in a high school bathroom with absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=10010)|
| 2:46:55| zero consequences for the murderers themselves? How would you feel safe not knowing what trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=10015)|
| 2:47:01| the next day will bring? The thing about trauma is that its influence is enduring. Whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=10021)|
| 2:47:06| person I'm working with is coming to me with a history of sexual assault, experiences of war,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=10026)|
| 2:47:11| childhood abuse, intimate partner violence, or just existing within a white supremacist country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=10031)|
| 2:47:17| in which the police continuously abuse their power to oppress Black lives, too often resulting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=10037)|
| 2:47:24| murder and the unjust incarceration that shatters families, that work I do is meant to heal the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=10044)|
| 2:47:30| wounds, but the scars will always remain. Trauma can be passed down from one generation to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=10050)|
| 2:47:36| next, and I mean that literally. The study of epigenetics shows how toxic stress from trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=10056)|

| 3:13:32| So no, this is not an anti-riot bill. This is a direct attack on our first amendment right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=11612)|
| 3:13:39| in the state of Tennessee and it was our first amendment that this country was founded on. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=11619)|

| 3:13:57| So in conclusion, this law is not about anti-rioting. This is about control over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=11637)|
| 3:14:06| constituents of Tennessee. This is about the government telling you what you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=11646)|

| 3:14:39| your own rules say that you limit public forum to six people. There are four other people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=11679)|
| 3:14:45| have signed up to speak. We can adjourn without further. I'm always going to make a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=11685)|

| 3:16:39| on how the city interacted with our folks at Lost Sheep. It was becoming quite a nightmare down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210504?start=11799)|
