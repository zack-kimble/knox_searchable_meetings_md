| 0:01:44| John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| The sheriff pension fund for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| The amount that we have in there and how much we have to keep in there to be actuarially sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=109)|
| 0:01:56| With the big hit that I'm sure it's taken with the stock market being down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| When's the next time we're going to have that audited to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| How much we have to keep in there to make sure it stays that way because if it continues at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| The stock market continues to lose value our pension fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| It's going to lose value and we will no longer be actuarially sound and I'm very concerned on how that can impact our budget coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=139)|
| 0:02:26| That's a that's an excellent question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| As a matter of fact the retirement and pension board is going to meet tomorrow to at least get a report from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| the director as well as some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| Consultants about our status and where it is and and and just to get an update so that the board knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| What's going on and you're absolutely correct is if the stock market continues as it is today then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=166)|
| 0:02:55| Our actuary which we plan to get an annual reports. We'll get an annual update on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| What the required or suggested contributions are and it's going up. There's no question about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| It if I recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| the amount that we were trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| How much we had to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| Was was based on a seven percent return is that still correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| And what happens if we actually have a negative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| The actuary I mean even last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Based on the actuary suggestions the county increased its contribution from a nine percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| based on payroll nine percent contribution to ten and a half percent contribution and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| So that increase was reflected in the current year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| with the stock market if it continues as it is now with no increase that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| There's no question that those numbers will go up and how much do we have in there right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| Well they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Roughly a hundred hundred million is a hundred million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| There's about if there was a fifty seven million dollar bond issue and then about thirty six million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| contributed from the individuals as they opted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| Well the 36 is reflected in a hundred though, right it's a total to total the total was a hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| So if we actually lose money, let's say we were hoping to get a seven percent rate of return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| We were hoping to get a seven percent rate of return we're hoping to make seven million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| roughly and if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| Lose two percent then we go down now. We're nine million in the hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| Is that something we're going to have to make up all at once possibly at this year if the stock market continues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| No, I would not expect that the county would have to make that up all at once but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| Knowing that we ask our actuary to look at this every single year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| An expectation would be to make up some loss and not all of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| But some of it and we caught we do what they call amortize the losses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| over a period of time and so we could smooth that out, but still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| the bottom line is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| If the stock market does not improve the expectation to keep it solvent the contributions will have to go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=312)|
| 0:05:20| It may be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| in the millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| Yeah, it's a big plan yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Now Craig we have a special call meeting at 9 in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| We do I'm into pension board inching board as okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| With with Chairman Ivan Harmon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Is there anything else to need to come before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| Seeing you have something yeah, Mr. Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Maybe if we can add something John if you can give us an update on like sales tax projections where we're at for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=350)|
| 0:05:59| You know we're I guess we're getting ready in the fourth month of our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| To see if we're on track or if we're behind or ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| We'll prepare one and make sure that we we have something for all commissioners to look at right. I think that's an excellent idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081009agendameeting?start=373)|
