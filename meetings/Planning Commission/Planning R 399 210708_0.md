| 0:15:11| the first being deny the HDR, high-density residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=911)|

| 0:15:36| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Chair will entertain a motion on the one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| Move we deny RN6 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=942)|

| 0:15:51| Commissioner, the HDR is motion number two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| under the staff recommendation for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| So it would be the motion to deny the high-density residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| I'm sorry, I've got one ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=961)|

| 0:25:21| Bus routes can be changed and as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| there are no durable land use changes that meet any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1523)|

| 0:25:30| The parcel in question is and has been zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1533)|

| 0:25:50| with the surrounding houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| In examining the existing plan designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| it is noted on page one of the plan amendment report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| that this parcel is surrounded on three sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| of low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| The parcel is divided by a blue-lined stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| with significant sloping that creates the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| and natural geographic transition between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1570)|

| 0:26:20| Extending the abutting medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| into the current neighborhood creates a domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| As one parcel leads to another of upzoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| we will lose the existing affordable homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| that provide affordable home ownership opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| to many working families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| As this request does not meet the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| for plan amendment, we ask that you deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| the requested plan amendments and subsequent zoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| With no plan amendments and the current zoning of RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| several homes and or duplexes could be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| that complement the surrounding houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| This is an affordable neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| and home to many working families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| their largest investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Additional homes and existing RN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| are welcomed by our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| so we can welcome more neighbors into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| The neighborhood navigated this process the best we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| We ran out of time to knock on every house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| in the radius of Kingwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| but every neighbor that we spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| on those petitions in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| there are four pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| complete opposition of item 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Their sentiment is that they invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| in this now very vibrant neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| They restored their homes or bought recently restored homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| believing this is a low-density neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| We implore you to visit our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| behind the duck pond as we are more commonly known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| These folks have invested in restoring this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| We have become a community of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| that treasure our over 100-year-old neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| and we respect the history and character of these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Please support our efforts and investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| we have made to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Your attention to this matter today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| is very much appreciated and respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Still have a minute and two seconds left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| if you'd like to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Your name and address, and you have about five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| I'm Patrick Smith with Van Smith Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Yes, we did meet with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| and I'll go into that meeting in a little bit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| but I just want to make the opening statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| You know, after moving to our residence on Holbrook Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| which is about 500 foot from this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| we frequently drove past this vacant site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| It's about 1.7 acres in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| About a half an acre to 0.6 of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| is actually a long Kingwood, which would kind of be developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| We noticed that the vacant site was used, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| it was owned by DAB, but it was being used as a local trash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| you know, yard refuse location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| for many of the neighborhoods in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| It was well and neatly kept at times and mowed and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| but generally had big potholes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| There was shopping carts on it at different times and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| And there was furniture on it sometimes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| So we approached DAB as we drove by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| We were restoring our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Again, it's 500 feet up the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| We were driving around this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| and we kept on asking ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| what would be a great use for that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| What would be a great use for that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| And as we looked at the topography and we looked at the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| we said, you know, just residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| single-family residences or duplex residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| or something along that line would be a great fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| That was just our thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| So we approached DAB, Disabled Veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| and inquired if they'd be willing to subdivide the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| and sell the remaining portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| At that time, we told them that we'd be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| in constructing residential units on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| including a mix of single-family homes and duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| So we thought we'd build a single-family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| maybe a duplex, a single-family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| something along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| not knowing even what it was zoned at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| the RN2 and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| We just had something in our mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| that we wanted to create in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| Once the property was acquired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| we began having conversations with the city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Ms. Portier being the main staff that we had there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| bringing schematic plans on how a single-family duplex townhome mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| may fit on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| and realized quickly that our current RN zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| and dimensional control of the RN2 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| would not support the development of a for-sale townhome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| that we desire to incorporate into the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| We kind of moved towards...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| We wanted to build a townhome-type product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| which some are row houses, some are brownstones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Some people have different...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| But we wanted to build a duplex, triplex, fourplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| something along those lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| and maybe a mix of single-family homes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Again, very small property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| We're talking about six, seven units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| or four single-family units for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| We continue to work with staff on a mix of townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| and single-family themes for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| and it was a suggestion of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| that an RN4 zoning category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| could meet our dimensional control requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| for the development of the product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| that we desire to construct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Now, the dimensional control side of it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| we don't have a lot of depth on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| and we don't have a lot of width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| It's a very small property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| the footprint in discussion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| Through general conversations with previous owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| and others in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| we understood that the site had been cited one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| as a cell phone tower site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| a community library, and many other uses in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| As investors in the community, we are their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| We are invested in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| We have done a tremendous job with our properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| and the neighbors around us, their properties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| We love Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| We feel strong about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| that the site was better served as residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| that may incorporate a little bit of MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| townhome medium-density residential product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| and provide additional type of products to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| That would include paved driveways, garage parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| public sidewalks, and fenced yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| This is actually contrary to many of the single-family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| that are being converted to duplexes and triplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| in this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| and they're short-term rental units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| and they're our neighbors today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| If I look at the area between Cedar and Fenwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Aster and Kingwood, I drove around informally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| I counted 160 structures, 160 residential structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| Not apartment units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| There's apartment units all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| I believe 23 of them were being utilized as rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| Of those 23, some of them were just single-family rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| Of those 23, there's 47 dwelling units in those 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| So about 30% of our population in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| that block, is renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| And when you ask the neighbors who owns these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| many of our neighbors own these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| A concern they had at the neighborhood meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| was that these would be rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| That's not what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| That's not what we're trying to build with the product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| We're trying to build a for-sale product to put on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| so people will move to this neighborhood and invest in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| keep their car in a garage, put up a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| mow their front yard, themed landscaping, and all these likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| Mr. Smith, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| You need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| You're five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| We have no agenda to resell the property to an apartment dweller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| We understand R and 4 has a you-can-do apartments and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| We have no agenda to resell to an apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| We're still under the same 35-foot height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| the same lot coverage, the same maximum height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| the same impervious surface as what would be there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| So we'd appreciate the efforts of staff and ask for favorable consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Opposition, would you like to have any other comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| before we turn it over to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2058)|
| 0:34:28| Doc, your name and address, please, and be cognizant of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Yes, my name is Rusty Harlow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| I know I've only got a few minutes here, but I'll just state some things really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| I grew up in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| I'm 42 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| I literally lived my entire life in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| This guy I never even met before in my entire life, and he just moves in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| and wants to develop a spot that has mercury in the ground soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| That's a whole other argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| At this point, we can't bring in all the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| but if somebody were to dig deep enough into that soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| they'll realize it's the coster shop and the duck pond's waste that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| So that's what you're building your property on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Not to mention, it's belonged to the VA for a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| and suddenly they just sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| As far as my understanding, they don't really even control the duck pond anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| They don't really control the Fountain City Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| For some reason recently, they just sold off the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| and now this guy is trying to develop on a piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| that should not be ever developed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| That's about 50 feet of, at least 50 feet of dirt there that's also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| not to mention, has no undisturbed red clay to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| So if you start building things like that on any kind of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| that has nothing sustainable underneath it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| you have a good chance of doing much like what Florida has right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| with that collapsed building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| You can go in that property and walk on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| and you'll see pit holes all in the ground where this stuff is falling through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| So it's not property that should be developed, if anything, maybe a dog park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| I mean, at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Thank you, Mr. Harlan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Permission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Questions or comments for staff before we decide on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| Commissioner Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Yeah, I just wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| I think this whole process kind of starts with the sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| and I think it would be good to get a real understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| of what the justification is for the sector plan change from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2173)|
| 0:36:22| Ms. Porche, do you want to respond to Commissioner Smith's comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| So the change in conditions is typically something like change in infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| which we would look at as an extension of a roadway, utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| because the general plan was written before an accelerated bus corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| was an actual thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| I think it's not something that would have been included in that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| We were looking at this as meeting one of the fourth criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| with changes in traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| whether or not a planned accelerated bus corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| would meet that change in conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| It was staff's position that it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| because it's something that is moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| but that's all up to you all to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| Yeah, I'm not sure I even understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| I guess it just means that the bus services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| are going to be increased at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Yeah, so it's basically, I don't know if you might be more familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| with the term bus rapid transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Some municipalities call it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| So it's basically a dedicated lane just for the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| It's timed to traffic signals and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| so as the bus approaches, lights change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| so there's less waiting time at the lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| to kind of make up for bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| So the time that someone spends riding on the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| mimics that of someone traveling in a car to their destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| So it increases ridership because you can reduce the miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| you put on your car by taking public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| I'm not sure if that's answering your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I have a question for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Mr. Smith, you want to come up to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2289)|
| 0:38:16| If I heard you right, you're looking at building single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| or maybe some duplexes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Then why are you requesting a change to medium-density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| Because we like the dimensional control, the RN-4 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| regarding the townhome portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| RN-2 does not allow townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| RN-3, a townhome is done by an SUP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| RN-4, we can do the townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| But we can also do everything downgrade of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| We can do duplexes or single families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| The site is very constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| We could put four to five single-family homes on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| But what we found in driving around to places like Autumn Walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| a townhome development that's north of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| and talk to folks that we've got to know up there, they love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| They love that duplex, that triplex, feel one-level living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| They have a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Everything's maintained up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| But we don't have but .5, .6, something like that, acres to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| We're not doing anything on the backside of it, very low impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| But we wanted the dimensional control of the RN-4 so that we could put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| single family in a duplex or a triplex and then maybe another single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| just utilizing the development space we have without encroaching on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| creek or the waterway and without really disturbing more than we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| disturb but still utilizing the position that we have on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Does that answer your question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Just a quick question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| Based on the last comment from the two in the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| I don't know if that's on the microphone, but I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| So when you mentioned that that was a hole dumping ground for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| cockroach farm, is there any evidence of waste in the ground that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| if they start digging, that it could cause harm to the residents in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Commissioner, if you could speak more into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| It's going to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| It's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| It doesn't appear to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| There it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| I'm on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| I'm off in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| I just want to make sure that if they start digging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| there's no potential hazards to the residents that are living in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| if there's mercury or other chemicals or things that were buried from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| old costure shop in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Do we know if that is indeed an old dumping ground for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| costure shop area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| I do not know if that's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| I'm assuming that the neighbors that have lived there for a while are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| privy to that knowledge than I would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| We could have it as part of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| That's something that they would delve into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| That's not something that we would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Soil conditions aren't something that we would look at as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Because at this moment, I mean, without knowing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| with just a promise, and again, the whole bus line thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| I've got an opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| I'm not going to bring it into this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| It's just a promise of a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| It's not actually something that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| I would almost rather just say let's give it 30 days and let's find out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| little bit more information before we vote on changing that sector plan in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| But I'll let other commissioners speak before I make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Also, I do want to say I did reach out to engineering regarding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| so they have looked into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| I'll ask the city now, the engineering staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| if they know of anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| I'm not aware of anything on the property specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| So if that happened many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| we may not have a record of anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| The only way to really know that would be to do some type of environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| testing to validate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| That was a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| And the reason I'm bringing it up is you are probably less than 1,000 yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| away from a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| So that's the other reason why I'm concerned about disturbing that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| Just because of the sheer number of kids that walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| My daughter attended that middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| and there are a lot of kids that walk past that property during the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| So that's why I'm bringing it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| because I'm just thinking about the number of kids in that area that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| that I'd want to see some type of environmental impact just to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| there's nothing in the ground before it starts getting dug and disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| May I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Just one second, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Commissioner A. Smith, are you requesting a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| I want to see if any other commissioners have any other thoughts before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| I just don't want to cut off the debate that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Also, if you do make that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| what do you want to obtain from that 30-day postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| or 60, whatever you desire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| What's the end product of what you want to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Within 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| I would want to see some type of environmental study done just to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| sure there's nothing in the ground if it was an old kosher shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| When they redeveloped the kosher shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| there was a lot of work that went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| There's plastic down on retention ponds to keep things from coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| There was a lot of mitigation for chemicals and stuff that were stored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| If stuff was dumped there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| I can only imagine what might be under the ground that could pose harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| So I just want to make sure that within that 30, 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| that we get a full understanding of what's underneath that dirt before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| just approve this and say, let's just go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to have to respond to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| And all I was going to ask is if you would allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| if I could ask for the applicant to make a comment because I'm assuming that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| it's pertinent to the environmental assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Mr. Smith, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| I understand your comment on that regarding hearsay and that there may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| something in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| and they've dumped dirt from the duck pond on there in the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| It's my understanding as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| We need to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Speak a little closer to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| We need to understand that the property is not zoned vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| It's zoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| We can build houses on it today without disturbing anything and no 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| delay in me going out and spending money testing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| Obviously, with this enlightenment that these folks are trying to give me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| on what's in the ground out here is a big chain reaction to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| different that the city did this and sold it to DAV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| and I purchased it from DAV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I would request that we go ahead and finalize today's zoning request on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| because the property is not zoned vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| It's zoned R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Something can be built on it without this board's approval or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| recommendation, and you will get no testing results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| I've heard what the citizens and the neighbors had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| I'm obviously cognizant, too, as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| that I would probably go do something about it or at least have some type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| legal recourse regarding what was done to that property and not disclose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| many different owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| So I'm not going to ask you to delay something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| approve or deny something on hearsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| I would like you to move on this motion, this recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| either way based upon what we provided you all today with respects to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| zoning categories, dimensional control, compatibility with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| We don't have a site plan to show you because we're working on the dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| control, potentially getting R4 zoning and doing a townhome Charleston type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| product they keep telling me in this area that people talk to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| So I'm not trying to be disrespectful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| but I can't spend a whole bunch of money and 30 days delay for nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| and I can build on it today in R2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| So if my motion were to pass for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| are you stating that you will just ignore going with a multi or triplex and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| just do single family homes in the next 30 days on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| I would have to consult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| I'm going to make my motion anyways for a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| I just want to know what's going on there and at least give city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| a chance to go back and do a little bit more history delving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| even if the applicant and city can go back and just look at was there at any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| time anything dumped there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| It gives us a little bit more time just to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Well, Mr. Smith, would you explain to me what the city is going to do as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| as me being the property owner if they've dumped something there that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| been leeching into that creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Mr. Smith, right now this is before commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| And it's not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| It's not about geotechnical conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| It's not appropriate now for you to be questioning the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| It's up for their consideration at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| So I'm going to open it up to Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| The only concern I have in this topic is that we decide land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| We have things in our scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| And, I mean, are we going to do this on any property that anybody ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| I'm not saying that it should be taken lightly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| but this gentleman is at considerable liability if there are issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| And I don't think he's going to be building on soils that are not suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| So my concern is, you know, if we're going to start making soil testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| and environmental phase ones to be submitted with every rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| then that's going to change a lot of what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| I think we have to look at this property and say, what is the correct use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| And then he would move forward from there to the city, and engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| and TDEC and all those concerns I think will be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| But they're very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| I don't want to dismiss them, but I just think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| what's to prevent anybody who's opposed to anything of alleging something's buried underground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| It's just not our job to dig underground and figure out what's there on every property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| So I'd say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| My bigger thing is still on the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| And I think to be consistent with our sector plans, we have to take them seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| And I'm not convinced that the bus line plan is a substantial enough change of conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2908)|
| 0:48:38| to justify a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| But I still, what I said about the soils, I believe is the way we should look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Chair recognizes Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| As the discussion has continued, I've added more questions and things to touch on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| I had a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| Have you looked into doing phase one or phase two environmental research on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| Or have you consulted with your attorney or anyone about the liabilities that you would face if there was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| I'm fully aware of what those are and what road to go down in that avenue, but not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2952)|
| 0:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| And I would say regardless of what you decide to do with the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| that would be something to seriously consider because of the potential liabilities that could come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2964)|
| 0:49:31| Commissioner, if you could speak a little closer to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| Can you pull it closer to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Yeah, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| That's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| So that was just my initial question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| And then I wanted to ask staff, which Commissioner Smith, I think, touched on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2981)|
| 0:49:49| Even if this had an environmental damage or something, would that affect the – this is not for – that's not something for us to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=2989)|
| 0:50:03| That would get covered in another area of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| It wouldn't be part of our considerations for the reasoning of the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| Commissioner Graff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| I make a motion that we deny the North City sector for medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3020)|
| 0:50:31| We have a motion by Commissioner Graff to deny the North City sector plan amendment to MDR, medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3031)|
| 0:50:39| Chair, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Maybe I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| Commissioner Smith, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Commissioner Smith has an outstanding postponement motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| I'm going to defer at this moment to Senior Smith on here just because we should not be considering what's under the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3061)|
| 0:51:11| So I'm going to withdraw that 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Commissioner Graff, we have a motion by you to deny the MDR medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Is there a second to Commissioner Graff's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3081)|
| 0:51:28| Hearing none, we are open for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| We have a second by Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3094)|

| 0:54:39| This is file 7B21RZ, rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| The applicant is Lin-Fang Wu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| Location, northeast side of Park Gate Lane, west of Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| Size of tract, 0.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| Present zoning is PC plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| The zoning requested, OB office medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| Staff recommendation, approve OB office medical and related services since it is a minor extension of the OB zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3305)|
| 0:55:13| and is compatible with the sector plan's office designation, land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| I think we've got Melinda DeRusa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| Applicant, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Would you like any opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| For the record, please state your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| My name is Lin-Fang Wu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| My address is 10808 Park Gate Lane, North Fairfield, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| And I'm planning to resume the commercial land to the OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| because the surrounding neighborhood is a single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| We are planning to build a residential house over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3369)|
| 0:56:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Is that virtual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| Ms. Porche, do you have any comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| This was addressed at agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| I was having trouble understanding the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| If he would mind to repeat what he said and speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Was there a question directed to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| We are trying to build a single family over the land instead of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| Right now it's a commercial, and we try to resume to OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| so we can build a residential house over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| So the request is to rezone to OB, which we are supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3421)|
| 0:57:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| As Ms. Brooks mentioned, OB allows residential, and that's what your intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| We're going to entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| If this wasn't already zoned planned commercial, I don't think I'd be in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| But this is a down zoning in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| How it ever got to be planned commercial, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| But I think that we should support OB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3461)|
| 0:57:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| So that was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| I moved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| Thank you, Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf to approve OB office medical-related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| First, staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Second by Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3487)|

| 0:58:09| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Next on the agenda is item number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| This is 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3496)|
| 0:58:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Item number 14, file number 7C21RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| The applicant is Joanna Toole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| The location, north side of Nubbin Ridge Road, northeast of Davis Lane at Maples Glen Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| Size attractive, two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| Present zoning is A, agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| Zoning requested, R.B. general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Staff recommendation, approve R.B. general residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| because it is consistent with the southwest sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| Low density residential designation as an extension of the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3536)|
| 0:59:03| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| So we do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| Applicant, would you like to go first or would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Opposition, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Go ahead, opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| You're virtually, so you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| My name is Kevin Marshall and 8420 Mecklenburg Court, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3572)|
| 0:59:43| I opposed this because of the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| I sent a little packet to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| I understand it was kind of late, but the property is just above us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3592)|
| 1:00:01| and I understand from the history that this was initially a landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3601)|
| 1:00:09| And on the 29th of March last year, we had a tree fall through our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3609)|
| 1:00:18| We tried to maintain the tree line in the back of our house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| but we missed one, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Fortunately, nobody was hurt, but it caused tens of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| of damage to our house, and with some of the pictures I sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3629)|
| 1:00:36| showed some of the damage on the exterior and interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| And also, while they're constructing this place on Lubbock Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| there'll be heavy construction vehicles going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| They'll be digging it for the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| You have to build additional infrastructure for electric, sewage, natural gas, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3656)|
| 1:01:03| And also, you would have additional traffic on Lubbock Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| And I do not wish for anybody else to have a tree fall through their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| And the West Hampton Association is below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3677)|
| 1:01:25| a major part of that is right below the Lubbock Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| So there's more potential, especially like you get a rainy season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| and the land is not the most stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| You're just asking for more trees to fall through more houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3700)|
| 1:01:48| So unless the developers will put up a nice huge old bond to cover any potential losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| I'm dead set against this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| I thank you for your time and attention to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| Thank you, Mr. Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| Applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| My name is John Valley and I represent Joanna Toole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| My address is 800 South Gate Street in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| This project is being rezoned not for development purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| but because we got a letter from code saying that if anything were to have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| to any of the buildings that were on these two pieces of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| they could not be reconstructed because they were in the agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| instead of the proper zone, which I believe to be RV or R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3755)|
| 1:02:43| All we're asking is to bring the zoning into conformance with what the rest of the tract is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| so in case something happens to one of these buildings, a fire or a tornado tears part of it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3770)|
| 1:02:58| that we'll be able to come back in and repair it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| We have done no construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| We don't plan on doing any construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| This property is two tracts away from Mr. Marshall's land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| so no tree could have fallen on this property that could have hit his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| So I'm not sure exactly what it is he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| We're not here for the purpose of developing and constructing anything, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| We're here for the purpose of making sure if something happens to what is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| that we can come in and repair it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| Thank you, Mr. Bowne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=3818)|

| 1:08:22| And for eight years I sat where you guys sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| And, Mr. Chair, for four years I sat where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| But I'm on the other side today and have no authority or status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| I'm just here to plead with you by a hundred property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| within the half-mile sector on the same side of Alcoa Highway where this development is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4119)|
| 1:08:48| And I won't take my five minutes, but I do need to read you a few things that led up to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4128)|
| 1:08:56| I did speak to a representative, his name is Sean, at the Dominion Group twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| We texted a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| I told him there were concerns of property owners within the half-mile sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| and on the same side of Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| He set a date and time to meet the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| I was able to facilitate Mount Olive Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| Dolores and I and others distributed about a hundred flyers to property owners in the sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4158)|
| 1:09:24| That's in Castle Pines, South Oaks, Rolling Hills, and Houses on Maloney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| We met at 6 p.m. on the 22nd of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| There were 67 property owners there, mostly one person per family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| Sean of the Dominion Group and their architect showed drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| and asked for questions that were responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| The questions were varied, and I'm sure you've read the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| so I won't go into that unless you ask me later for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| I spoke first, and my biggest concern was and is that when apartments infringe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| into single-family neighborhoods, property values drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| A lady asked a question, would they accept rental assistance tenants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| Sean indicated they would try not to, but if they couldn't rent all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| they would likely give some to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| That ran a red flag for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| In 2002, we built a few apartments in South Knoxville in the Moody Avenue-Chapman Highway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4222)|

| 1:12:11| So, K-Trans was mentioned, and if these are upscale apartments, surely the tenants would have a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4331)|

| 1:13:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| We're granting additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| There's three or four others that would – or more – that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| We've got seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Try to keep your comments at a minimum so that others can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| And I will lean in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| My name is Reed Massengill, and I own and reside at 3116 Maloney Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| directly across from the easternmost property line of Dominion's proposed complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| I've stated my opposition online, so I won't repeat that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| However, I have several questions to put out to you that I hope the developer will be able to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4455)|
| 1:14:23| First, unless the developer's plan has changed, by my math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| their ten three-story buildings of 24 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| and one three-story building of 54 units totals 294 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| My first question is how many bedrooms and or potential occupants does that actually represent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| If even half of those 294 units are three-bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| the complex would accommodate nearly 600 residents and their vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| Second, what firm was engaged by Dominion to perform the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| and on what dates, what days of the week, and at what times was the traffic study performed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| Or has the developer applied for rezoning without engaging a traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| I'll skip my point about the water table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| and my concerns about the retention pond at the edge of their property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| closest to Maloney and closest to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| I'm the constituent who asked those of you voting on this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| to drive this stretch of Maloney Road all the way to its intersection with Maryville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| just past the one-lane underpass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| I bring this up because the two entries and exits from the proposed complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| empty directly onto Maloney Road, one across from one of the several entries for Severe Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| one almost directly across from my driveway and my two-and-a-half-acre property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| What this means is that every materials delivery, construction vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| or apartment occupant with a moving van or a U-Haul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| will only be able to approach that new property from the roundabout side of Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| If approved, not only will all that construction traffic and resident traffic clog this end of Maloney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| but after construction is completed, so will every DoorDash, Instacart, Uber, UPS, FedEx, and other delivery driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4575)|
| 1:16:25| Although the developers may be pitching this as a complex targeted to medium-income professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| its proximity to UT with less than a five-minute drive will make it appealing to college students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| whose greater instability and more frequent moves will result in even greater traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| on this rural two-lane residential road with no sidewalks, no improvements, no bike lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4601)|
| 1:16:48| There are other obvious issues of 60, 70 years' worth of mature trees that would have to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4608)|
| 1:16:56| which serve as a buffer between our neighborhood and Alcoa Highway and South Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| I realize that I'm just one resident, and while my neighbors who work regular jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| will experience less of the potential construction trauma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| I'm a writer who works from home trying to complete a book for UT Press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| I work from home all day, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| To put it in some religious terminology that the Dominion folks will understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| to me, this is what hell will look and sound like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| Please vote no to this rezoning request, and if you have not, as I requested in my online comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4647)|
| 1:17:38| driven this segment through the one-lane underpass, which will not accommodate a small U-Haul track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4658)|
| 1:17:46| think about your vote. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| Mr. Randolph?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| Again, be cognizant of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| We have others that want to speak, and we are limited on time, so keep your comments to the case at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| My name is Marcus Randolph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| I live at 5326 Johnston Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| I'm a representative of the Rolling Hills Subdivision, and although we had many concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| I'll speak of the two major ones today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| One that has not been spoken of today will be what happens to the water when they start the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| and the subsequent apartment complex they choose to put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| As it is of today, any time we get a thorough storm, and the storm that's coming through right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| will cause a backup of water into the subdivision, into the cul-de-sac they have attached at that corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| at the bottom of Johnston Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| Once those trees, the land, the soil is gone to absorb that water, that will only get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4726)|
| 1:18:54| As it is now, that water backs up into our yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| We have spent thousands of dollars to fight that to this point with very little help from the county to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| but that can only get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| Add the additional traffic that that will add as they have attached it into that cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| we do not have the ability to handle any traffic as that would be another access point to Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| to go through our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| As it is now, there's an adjoiner of our street, Rolling Hills, that goes into the South Circle Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| and you would have to make a let-him-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| You can barely get out there in the morning as it is if you have somebody going in or going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4780)|

| 1:19:50| Dawn Thomas, virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Thank you, commissioners, for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| I'm a Lakemore Hills resident, and I oppose the proposed 200-300 unit multifamily apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4800)|
| 1:20:07| My concerns are the proposed apartment complex is not substantially consistent with surrounding single-family homes development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4807)|
| 1:20:15| I'm also fearing of a decrease in property values in surrounding neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| desecration of mature landscape and natural beauty, traffic congestion, potential for traffic accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4820)|
| 1:20:28| lack of control over rent costs and quality of tenants, light pollution, runoff water, and storm drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4828)|
| 1:20:35| Lakemore Hills is a lifestyle neighborhood whose residents have worked hard for the privilege of living here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| Property owners cherish, maintain, and improve their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| Protection of neighborhood quality, density, and property values are of key importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| I understand the higher population density apartment complex may increase potential for local business investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| However, the negatives of the proposed development greatly outweigh the minor inconveniences of having to drive a bit farther for gas and groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| I anticipate more local investment will come in the future based on commuters traveling between downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| and the apartment or the airport in Alcoa and Maryville areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| We don't need to add a big concentration of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| An apartment complex would be a big negative for this highly desirable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Thank you, Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| Commissioners, we still have several more people that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| If you want to stop at this point, I mean, they're five, ten minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| Or would you rather have to hear more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| I'd rather hear more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| I mean, that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| I say we give them five more minutes and then that will give the opposition, I mean, the applicant as well, 15 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| Next on the list is Suzanne Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| I'm in favor of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| Paul McQuaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| Your name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| And, again, please be cognizant of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| We still have a few more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| My name is Paul McQuaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| I live on Ginn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| I'm two streets over from this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| And I'll first very briefly tell you that I have 30 years of experience of advising planning commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4939)|
| 1:22:26| My career was as a soil conservationist, so I'm intimately familiar with runoff, drainage, erosion control, groundwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4946)|
| 1:22:35| and all of those issues which you've already heard are present in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4955)|
| 1:22:41| But in my core, what I would tell you as the planning commissioner, ask you, is that, yes, they have, in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4961)|
| 1:22:50| we have a long history of do what you want on your own land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| But they bought that land as single-family residential, and that's what it ought to stay as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| We don't mind them developing it in appropriate what goes with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| But what they're proposing would, we've spent our life savings to move to this area because it has trees, because it's single-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4986)|
| 1:23:16| And what they're proposing would change the neighborhood and devalue our property immensely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| I won't go into the details of erosion and all the other runoff issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| Those are things that they always have a solution for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| But I would say go look at retention ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| Rarely are they maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| Rarely do they function properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| Engineers do really good drawings, and they rarely get built like the engineer designed them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| and they're very rarely maintained like they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| Thank you, Mr. McQuaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Mike Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| I'm here to support the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| Mr. Chalmers, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| Name and address, please, and you have what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| Thank you. Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5045)|
| 1:24:06| Sean Chalmers, 3834 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| If I may, I've got a response I wanted to hand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5051)|
| 1:24:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5061)|
| 1:24:46| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| The packet is intended to establish context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| As we've seen an opportunity at this location, at the corner essentially of Alcoa Highway and Maloney Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5092)|
| 1:25:00| we see a unique opportunity for a strong multi-family complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| We're still in the concept stage, and I've sought to reach out to local constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| leaders in the area, members of City Council and Planning Commission Carson Daly, Tommy Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5109)|
| 1:25:17| to try to get input before we get our plans to set in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| And since I've heard a lot of the concerns with our concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| we've actually revised the concept based on a lot of that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| We are a local developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| We do multi-family senior living, and so we're familiar with a lot of these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| And we feel in this case that this site is appropriate for multi-family, and we can address many of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| One, as far as the looks of our communities, we take a lot of pride in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| We not only develop, but we also manage our own communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| And so we want to have communities where people enjoy living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| One of the previous spokespeople mentioned about having a lifestyle community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| and that's how we would see our apartment community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| We want it to be attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| There was a previous comment about HUD financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| This would not be a low-income rent type community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| I think there was a misunderstanding there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| This would be market-rate apartments ranging probably from around $1,300 to $1,700 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| a mixture of ones, twos, and three-bedroom units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| One of the biggest changes, we actually have reduced our target max to 240 units to both allow increased buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5182)|
| 1:26:30| We understand about trees and trying to preserve as many as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| having sensitive boundaries with residential neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| So if you notice on the new concept that we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| we've increased the buffers on the adjacent kind of eastern and northern sides up to 80 feet where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| We're going to preserve more trees and create more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| We're also willing to agree to dark-sky requirement light fixtures to help with the light pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| The way that our concept is laid out, it has the parking in the center with the buildings around also shield both from noise and from light pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5216)|
| 1:27:05| Regarding the traffic, we really believe the location is perfect for an increase in traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5225)|
| 1:27:11| There's a very large church right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Obviously, Alcoa Highway has lots of traffic on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| and so we would see our residents utilizing Alcoa Highway way more often than the problem tunnel that's out to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5236)|
| 1:27:25| Landscaping and natural beauty is important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| Talking with Alcoa Highway Beautification Council and all their work that they've done on landscape designs by interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| we would like to come alongside them and utilize similar plantings and the same landscape designer so that our landscaping would connect with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5254)|
| 1:27:43| Additionally, the work that's been done for the greenway down in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| we see that as a unique amenity that our residents could take advantage of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| so we'd like to find a way to connect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| We've spoken with Knox County Engineering because it's a Knox County road that we'd be spilling onto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5277)|
| 1:28:04| We've actually tried to change it to one single access point, and it would be across the street from the church on the easternmost side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| There's kind of a balance of concerns from the residents where they would like that entrance to be further towards the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| and engineering would like to see that further away from the highway to allow stack-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| So we believe that's a good balanced approach to kind of be in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| I think the school was discussed. Safety and security is obviously a concern for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| We don't think residents want to live somewhere that's not safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| and so we would desire if there's current crime concerns or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| we would look to KPD and Knox County Sheriff's Department to help address any concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| We're even investigating a security system that Lakemore Hills currently uses to track vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| The other thing I wanted to discuss is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Our concept actually encompasses more than the parcel on this particular application that's within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| The next two adjacent parcels that are in the county are also part of our concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| that we will subsequently submit an additional rezone application for probably within the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| and I'm trying to show on the new concept plan where that line is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| Talking to MPC staff as well as Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| there is precedent for projects that straddle that line and ways to work out those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| As far as stormwater, we work with SM&E Engineering, a respected local civil engineering group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5355)|
| 1:29:22| Stormwater runoff is managed pretty closely, and as far as as-builts, after construction, all that, it's handled pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| Obviously we would be liable to do that the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| We're excited about this opportunity, and we understand there's both positive and negative views on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| but we believe it's appropriate for this particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| Ms. Proctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5385)|
| 1:29:53| I'm Kathy Proctor, and I live at 2429 Lakemore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| I chair the Alcoa Highway Beautification Council, which is a group of residents from both sides of Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| and these are made up of people that are from homeowners associations on both sides, garden clubs, and 501c3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5406)|
| 1:30:15| And over the past few years, we've worked with TDOT, with the City of Knoxville, and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| to ensure that the expansion of Alcoa Highway will be a pedestrian-friendly addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5422)|
| 1:30:30| For instance, we made sure that there would be pedestrian access for both sides of the highway across the bridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5430)|
| 1:30:38| that there would be a continuation of the greenway, which wasn't in the original TDOT plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| to be able to connect Knoxville with Blount County greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| We also proposed the inclusion of the roundabouts that are now a part of the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5449)|
| 1:30:57| and we have been working for quite a few years on the development of a landscape plan that TDOT would find acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5457)|
| 1:31:05| and is funded and is scheduled to be implemented in the fall of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| So, we've got a lot invested in Alcoa Highway so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| Now, a few years ago, MPC updated their south sector plan, and they made a presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| and a lot of us came to that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| And they showed us potential zoning changes for this area that would help enrich the community that we live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| and especially the commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| MPC staff explained to us at that time that it was essential for us to get the number of residents in this area up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5496)|
| 1:31:46| in order to support businesses along Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| Well, years have passed since that presentation, and we've had road construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5510)|
| 1:31:57| No multifamily has been built during that period, and we have seen business after business close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| or move to other parts of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| So, in July of 2019, the Beautification Council, in conjunction with East Tennessee Community Design Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5527)|
| 1:32:16| held a workshop where we focused on this commercial corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| and looked at different things that could happen in the redevelopment of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5541)|
| 1:32:28| So, we brought in business owners, property owners from this area, local residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| We had a number of design professionals, staff from MPC, about 75 people total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| and we spent a day looking at research from Knox County Library and surveys that we did with residents along that corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5562)|
| 1:32:51| and came up with a number of solutions of what this area could develop into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| And these areas included things like groceries, gas stations, banks, restaurants, visitor center, library, and multifamily residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5578)|
| 1:33:11| All of these things, all of those services were things that those of us that live on both sides of Alcoa Highway desperately need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5591)|
| 1:33:20| It appears to me that the project that we're talking about today seems to be a very thoughtful design, well done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5600)|
| 1:33:26| and it's actually been done by a resident in this area, an architect that lives in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| and certainly cares about their own property values also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| The targeted customer group is a medium income professionals, which I think would be a total asset to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5615)|
| 1:33:44| We see that the traffic impact really isn't as significant as we've heard because it's located adjacent to Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5624)|
| 1:33:54| so that is the main corridor that people would need to go both to Blount County or to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5634)|
| 1:34:03| But the main thing that is really a plus about this project is that it makes a very wise transition between single family residential and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5643)|
| 1:34:15| We don't want to see on that piece of property, which is for sale and will be developed, a convenience store or a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5655)|
| 1:34:23| That's not a pleasant transition from single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| I see that change is often and always difficult, especially in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| but I think that this change is needed to bring life back to a commercial corridor along Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5675)|
| 1:34:42| and we completely support this project. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| Thank you, Ms. Proctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| Suzanne Bowman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5690)|
| 1:34:59| Suzanne Bowman. I live at 3717 Maloney Road in Lakemore Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| I've lived there 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| Alcoa Highway has increased in status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| We have this wonderful road system through the area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| I had a neighbor who was killed trying to get home one day on Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| so I'm thankful that this improvement to the neighborhood is being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| and I'm excited about all of the development that will come as a result of this increased highway effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5728)|
| 1:35:38| When the property on Maloney Road at this interchange became available, I was excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| because I feel that development needs to happen in the Alcoa Highway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| And as the folks who spoke before me have said, it will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| We need to think about it in a planned way that will make it efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5756)|
| 1:36:02| that will make it serve the needs of the neighbors around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| I urge you to consider the things that the opposition has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| I don't want to diminish their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| but I would like for you to consider the effectiveness and the appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| of the multifamily dwelling that we are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| When the East Tennessee Community Design Center went through the brainstorming session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| there were developers there, and they said, this is a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| We envision many wonderful benefits for the community, including grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5796)|
| 1:36:44| We haven't had one in well over ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| Gas stations, we haven't had one in about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| Restaurants, places where people can go and shop for their needs of the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| And those things will happen as long as there are residents there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| who can provide those things for the businesses to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5823)|
| 1:37:15| Those of us that have witnessed the decline of the commercial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| to its present status as a blighted commercial strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| envision a neighborhood center that provides the diverse array of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| once available in our lovely neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| I encourage the Planning Commission to approve the RN-5 rezoning for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5853)|
| 1:37:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| Thank you, Ms. Bowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Mr. Mike Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5863)|
| 1:37:54| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| I'm Mike Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| I'm at 3717 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| I've lived in that area for 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| I'm an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| I've practiced architect planning, practicing for about 50 years, I hate to admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| I guess I look like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| I'm here basically to support the project for the reasons that you've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| But there's one piece that I'd like to really focus on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| the fact that the workshop that was conducted with 70 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| we had people that owned property in the neighborhood that loved that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| that came and put in their time to develop an approach to revitalize our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5915)|
| 1:38:42| And the thing that surprised me was that these four teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5922)|
| 1:38:48| and taking in all the data, they all came back with a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| and the surprise was that including in the proposal in every four teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5931)|
| 1:38:57| was apartments, condominiums as an issue that had to be fulfilled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| if we wanted to get the population to the point that we could support our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| And I think the fact that we had that kind of commitment from the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| on both sides of the highway, speaks great, a heavy thing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5953)|
| 1:39:20| I've had experience in development for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| I worked in Kansas City for a while with the J.C. Nichols Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| the development of a country called Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| And that plaza, if you've ever been there, is very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| It's a shopping area and a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| And I got the chance when I was young to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| well, why is this facility so successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| And he looked at me and said, it's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| It's the diversity of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| You have got to have housing from apartments and condos and private residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| clustered in a way that they will support the commercial facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| And that's been the Country Club's Plaza model for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| That was 1967.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| There was some addition about property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| I went back and got on the Internet and looked up to see if I could buy a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6008)|
| 1:40:14| or live in the Plaza area today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| And what I found was there are a number of apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| and their price range were $1,000 to $2,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| The condos there are selling for $650,000 to $750,000 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6026)|
| 1:40:35| And the private residences, which is a mix, run from the lowest I could find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| was a fixer-upper that I could buy for $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| The rest of the residents in that mid-range were $500,000 to $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6046)|
| 1:40:53| And the rest of the property for sale was $1 million to $1,400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6053)|
| 1:41:02| I would say that that area with apartments, condos, and housing has held its value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| because it was built in 1923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| That model is the model that this group and the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| has set up for the Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| That model is that diversity of housing to get the proper mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| so that commercial and residential and services can support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| This is a very special area and entry to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| I hope that you approve this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| This is the first step to move that decaying corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| into some sort of progressive redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| Thank you, Mr. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| Commissioner, you've heard comments from opposition as well as the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| Are there any questions for staff before we discuss it further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6111)|
| 1:42:00| Chair, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| First off, I need to disclose I live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| I attended the meeting that he spoke of with the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6130)|
| 1:42:17| The only thing was I was 15 minutes late and missed his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| I heard the neighborhood concerns, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| I don't have any financial interest in it, and neither does anyone in my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| So get that out right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| I'm going to try and stay right with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6159)|
| 1:42:47| We're talking about the sector plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| The staff recommendation is to approve medium-density residential office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| because it provides a transitional land use between the highway corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| and the adjacent single-family residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| It doesn't say what kind of a transition it provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| When you go from one thing to another, that's a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| Not always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| Sometimes it's not so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| I look at anything like this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| Yeah, that's a transition, and so is the original or the present zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| is office NRN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| That's a transition from the highway to the single-family Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6223)|
| 1:43:52| If you put what's being requested, the medium-density residential in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| instead of being about maybe one to the acre density, you're at 30 to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6239)|
| 1:44:08| I don't see where that helps anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| That's a negative rather than a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| If you want to build an office park in there, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| You can have people there from 8 in the morning until 6 in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| and then it's quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| They go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| There's nobody there on the weekends, nobody there on holidays, a lot less traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| That's a transition from the highway to the single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| I don't think that you can make a case that you should go from office to medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6286)|
| 1:45:05| They brought up their—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| God, this is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| I live in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| In the sector plan, if you've read the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| there's a thing called the small area sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| and that defines from Maloney Road to Woodson Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6325)|
| 1:45:32| actually not even to Woodson Drive, to Montlake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| and the area that they're talking about, commercial, high-density residential, office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6336)|
| 1:45:46| That's what's in that plan, and it says—I'm going to read a little bit of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6346)|
| 1:45:55| MPC staff has premised the development of this plan to address the following objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6355)|
| 1:46:05| Summer's obvious, so I'll skip them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| In item two, protecting, strengthening both commercial, office, and residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6369)|
| 1:46:17| In other words, protecting the residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| Down to item five, protect the character of the neighborhoods adjacent to Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6382)|
| 1:46:29| I don't think 30 to the acre do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| Transportation and land development principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6393)|
| 1:46:37| Create more intense buffers for the adjacent established neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6397)|
| 1:46:45| Number three, diversify development to include commercial, office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| and if frontage roads are built, medium to high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| There's no frontage road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| Where they're calling for the medium to high-density residential is further north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6419)|
| 1:47:06| where there are large areas, where we had the health club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| where the grocery stores used to be and so forth, that are all vacant now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6432)|
| 1:47:19| So, yes, they call for it, but not in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6439)|
| 1:47:25| They called for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| That's where I think it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6447)|
| 1:47:35| And then again, the transition is too intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6455)|
| 1:47:44| It's harmful rather than helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| Let the others speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| I'm sure I recognize Commissioner Amy Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| I just wanted to mention to the residents here at Lakemore Hills how appreciative I am that they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6479)|
| 1:48:05| I love your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| I think it's a great place to live, a great place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| Actually, about 25 years ago when I moved to town, I looked at Lakemore Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| and loved the houses, loved the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| and actually chose to move more to Bearden area because I wanted a Kroger close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6498)|
| 1:48:24| I still live in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| We actually have an apartment complex that is not at the entrance of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| It's actually in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| It's nestled in the middle of our neighborhood in Forest Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| And at the time, I don't think Domain Group manages them yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| but they used to own Green Tree Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| You know, when we moved in there, I don't know if I was excited about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6522)|
| 1:48:50| but I've learned to really appreciate the diversity of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| I really value the amenities that we have in the Bearden area, being able to walk places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6535)|
| 1:49:02| And a lot of that is because of the density that we have both along the corridors in Sutherland, in Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| And, you know, I just kind of encourage you to kind of look beyond maybe what you have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| to what the future is going to hold for Lakemore Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| It could be even better with having places that you can walk to and access easily from Lakemore Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| And I will say that since Dominion Group did own that apartment complex, they were good neighbors for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6564)|
| 1:49:31| and we actually have an access point that goes out to some other apartment complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6571)|
| 1:49:38| and they did a reasonable job and a good job of trying to encourage traffic out away from our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| So I'm planning on supporting this job, this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| and I'm looking forward to seeing what Alcoa Highway has in store for the next 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Tim Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| Well said, Commissioner Midas, and I too will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| And I think, I don't know how, I'm challenged as to how this does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6604)|
| 1:50:10| or we lose the protection of the neighborhood by putting this here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| and I think staff said it well by saying it is a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| I see that they've lost 17% of the population in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| and to think that office is going to thrive in this area I think is a long shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6624)|
| 1:50:31| Office citywide, really countywide, regionwide is anemic at best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6631)|
| 1:50:38| and I think this is our best option to revitalize an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| And if you look across the nation, these mixed housing types are sweeping the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6643)|
| 1:50:49| This is the new type development that the country is seeing, and they're embracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| And I think this is appropriate, and I'm prepared to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| but there's some other folks that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| But after they speak, I'm glad to make a motion. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| I don't want to be repetitive with what the other two commissioners have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| but I talked about sector plans and the importance of sector plan changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| and to me this is the completely justified sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| The road improvements done to Alcoa Highway were done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| because it was a dysfunctional situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| and it now opens up so many possibilities for that whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| And I think this is going to be a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| We see it at Ebenezer Road and Westland Drive with the new apartments down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| that back up to very nice residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| and it's beautiful if you want to drive by and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| The developers, Dominion Group, very reputable local guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6708)|
| 1:51:53| So I think this is a great thing. I will always support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6713)|
| 1:51:59| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| I want to direct my comments to everyone who can hear me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| as this microphone comes and goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| I am very, very familiar with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| Alcoa Highway was one of the most dangerous highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| Six years ago I ran for state representative promising to fund Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6745)|
| 1:52:31| to get it fixed. I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| So to those people that are going to live in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| where this development is going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| I'm going to have to apologize because I made that promise, kept it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| and now this is what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| This is going to be development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| Alcoa Highway is a $448 million project based on all the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| It's going to result in about a billion-dollar investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| along the corridor once it's completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| So this isn't the only type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| I am appreciative of the Alcoa Highway Beautification Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| and what they're doing to keep that area looking nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| I know TDOT worked very closely. We had a lot of public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| So I knew there was going to be development coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6788)|
| 1:53:11| I am a little concerned with this many houses coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6791)|
| 1:53:14| I do appreciate the reduction down to 240, but this area is still a food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| The nearest grocery store is the Publix down at Kingston Pike and Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| Or you can fight all the back roads and make it to the Kroger over on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| So there's still some concerns about just the amount of trips and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6809)|
| 1:53:36| I'm not crazy, just being honest, about what looks like the apartment canyon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| on the front up against Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| So I'd just love for you to just kind of look at that and see if there's a way to soften that a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| just so it does fit into the area and doesn't look like Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6827)|
| 1:53:53| But again, all of that said, listening to the sector plan, this is what was intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6833)|
| 1:54:00| I have spoken with Carson Daly. He is supportive it does fit into the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| And South Knoxville needs growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| That growth will also further investments in the schools, investment in the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| Johnsonville Highway is going to have to be fixed down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| The more tax dollars we have to fix that, the sooner it's going to get done, which will make that safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| So reluctantly, I am going to support it just because it does fit and meet all of the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6864)|
| 1:54:32| that we have put in place for development like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| But I just wanted to state, while I'm not sorry that we're fixing Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| because I did lose a lot of friends in head-on collisions that we're trying to turn left out of Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6880)|
| 1:54:47| I'm not going to apologize for fixing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| I do apologize that we fixed it because it's going to mean more development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| So with that, Mr. Chair, I'll second a motion from Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6895)|
| 1:55:02| I don't think we got a motion yet, but we'll be there in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| And I just wanted to speak a bit more about some of the things that Commissioner Midas spoke about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6908)|
| 1:55:16| and also about the transition, which has been debated today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| I have driven that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| I think the improvements that have been made with the roundabouts and the access across Alcoa Highway are incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6924)|
| 1:55:30| I'm so glad that they've been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| When I look at that space now, I see an area that desperately needs a transition from Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6933)|
| 1:55:40| It is a very busy, deadly road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| And to have some better buffer than what exists there right now into the single-family zones, I think, is desperately needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6944)|
| 1:55:54| And when I saw this project, that is what I saw, was a transition that would be the kind of still residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6954)|
| 1:56:04| It's not just commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| It's not just a market or a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| It's something that speaks to there are people living here, and you can see them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| and it becomes a more pedestrian-friendly and active space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| Not a car space, but a person space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| And that is what Alcoa Highway, in my opinion, so desperately needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| So I see those apartments as bringing that component in and bringing it in in a very attractive and manageable way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6984)|
| 1:56:33| so that that then moves into single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| One more comment on that, because it is difficult to hear so much opposition to multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=6997)|
| 1:56:47| and what that will do to a neighborhood, due to one's property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| And when it is managed well and developed well, thoughtfully integrated into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7014)|
| 1:57:01| you do see those housing prices go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| When I think about one of the most desirable places to live in the city, which is in Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| in the very heart of it, it has apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| I've lived in this apartment with people who were 60 years older than me and who were 10 years younger than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7035)|
| 1:57:22| And it was a very dense community and one that had people knowing one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7042)|
| 1:57:29| and also looking, frankly, speaking for myself, aspirationally to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| I do want to have a single-family residence someday, and I can see it over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| and that's the way I want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| I think there are a lot of positives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| I just wanted to touch on that, because it is not just, there are many lenses to look through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| and I plan on voting in favor of this for all of the reasons that I've stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7066)|
| 1:57:52| and others that have been brought up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| Thank you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| Everybody wants to vote for this, but I'm wondering, under the small area plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7081)|
| 1:58:08| it says MPC staff has premised the development of this plan to address the following objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7088)|
| 1:58:20| That's six-lane the highway, set aside parts for commercial, set aside parts for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7100)|
| 1:58:28| I'm not saying that apartments don't belong there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| I'm saying that the staff set this parcel aside for office, office and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7113)|
| 1:58:43| and nothing has changed, and to change the sector plan, something has to have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7123)|
| 1:58:54| So which one of these items in the sector plan apply to make the change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7134)|
| 1:59:02| That's my argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| I can't find where anything that was proposed in the sector plan really hasn't happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7144)|
| 1:59:16| and so why, what facilitates or why could we initiate a plan or a change in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7156)|
| 1:59:28| There's nothing to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| Thank you, Chair Phelps. I'm prepared to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| I'd just like to cite one other example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| North Shore Town Center is a good example of mixed-type housing that is thriving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| and I think that to answer your question, Commissioner Graff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| I think the changes in the road network and highway improvements are exactly the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| So I make the motion to approve MDRO per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| We have a motion by Commissioner Hill, seconded by Commissioner Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| to approve MDRO, medium density to residential offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| All in favor of the motion, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| Motion carries. There's one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7216)|
| 2:00:20| I think we're playing kind of loose with amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7220)|
| 2:00:32| Chair will entertain a motion on the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7232)|
| 2:00:40| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| Are we at the office part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| This is the second page on the one-year plan amendment from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7245)|
| 2:00:55| Let's just approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| The motion is to approve the one-year plan amendment to MDRO, medium density to residential land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7256)|
| 2:01:02| Motion carries for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| Is that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7265)|
| 2:01:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| We have a motion by Commissioner Hill, seconded by Commissioner Midas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| to approve the one-year plan amendment per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| All in favor of the motion, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| We have one no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Chair will entertain a motion to approve RN-5, general residential neighborhood rezoning, per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7283)|
| 2:01:31| To approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| Is there a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| Motion by Commissioner Hill, seconded by Commissioner Midas, to approve RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| Before we vote, RN-5 zoning, because it provides a transition down from the Alcoa Highway corridor to the adjacent single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7308)|
| 2:02:03| RN-5, again, allows about 30 to the acre on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7323)|
| 2:02:13| Maybe we ought to look at dropping that down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| Because that's not a transition down that I maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7338)|
| 2:02:26| Putting that many apartments there is a transition up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7346)|
| 2:02:32| Right now, we've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| Correct in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| All in favor of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| And I know this is in the city, so we can't do conditional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| So I'm going to look to the applicant, because I want to, I'd like you to come to the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| because I'd like to get it on record or verbal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| In the concept that you showed us, it shows that you're trying to save the mature trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| and that buffer between the back side and the east side of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| I just want that you are committed to trying your dead level best to protect those mature trees and to keep that buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| We have a motion in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7390)|
| 2:03:11| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to take about a, I know those who are wanting to work on Ruggles Ferry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7398)|
| 2:03:26| we're going to take about a 10-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Everybody stretch their legs and use the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| Be back at 343.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| If I could have your attention, everybody return to your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| Commissioners, let's get started here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7420)|

| 2:04:40| because it is consistent with the growth policy plan, northwest county sector plan, and surrounding zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7480)|
| 2:04:48| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7488)|
| 2:04:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| We do have, I think, one person that's opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7495)|
| 2:05:02| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| Applicant, I guess you're ready to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| Your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| Ron Worley, P.O. Box 70515 Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| If there's no opposition, I'd like to accept based on the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7514)|
| 2:05:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| Chair, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| We have a motion by Commissioner Eddie Smith, seconded by Commissioner Kraft to rezone PR plan residential up to one dwelling unit per acre per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7526)|
| 2:05:36| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| Thank you, Mr. Worley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| I appreciate you all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7543)|
| 2:05:50| Next item is agenda item number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| This is a subdivision report, concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| We do have some variances in alternative design standards and concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| File at 3 SB21C, subdivision is Inbrook Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7562)|
| 2:06:08| Applicant is R.C. Ruggles, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| Location, north side of Ruggles Ferry Road, hike, excuse me, west and north of Blake Lane, east of Graves Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7572)|
| 2:06:22| Acreage is 201.06 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| Zoning is A, agricultural and R.A., low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| Existing land use is agricultural forestry vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| Proposed use, detached residential lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| Number of lots, 475.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| We have four variances requiring planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| We have alternative design standards requiring commission approval numbering 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| The staff recommendation, approve variances 1 through 4 and alternative design standards 1 through 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7613)|
| 2:07:01| on the recommendation of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| Because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| Motion on the concept plan is to approve the concept plan subject to 17 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7644)|
| 2:07:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7645)|
| 2:07:26| To say that there is opposition would be an understatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| but would you like the opposition to go first or would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| I'd like to make a statement, open a statement to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| And more than likely we're going to allow more than five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| I was going to say I was asked before the meeting if they could have 15 minutes for the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7657)|
| 2:07:43| which would also give the applicant 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| So rather than going through this throughout the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| I'm just going to go ahead and make the recommendation for 15 minutes to start with for both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| Unless there's any opposition, I will agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| So you're welcome to start out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| You have up to 15 minutes total, and you can use all of it now or some of it for opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7686)|
| 2:08:07| My name is Blaine Christman, PO Box 520 Lewisville, Tennessee, 37777.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7687)|
| 2:08:12| I am the developer for Innsbruck Farms in the Ruggles Ferry area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7692)|
| 2:08:18| I am the 2011 Homebuilder Association Builder of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| I was a 2014 Homebuilding of Greater Knoxville president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| This project came to me a little less than a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| The Blake family, who many of you know, have been around for well over 100 years, have opted to sell their farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7711)|
| 2:08:39| It's been around a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7719)|
| 2:08:40| It's an old farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| It's got a lot of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| When they came to me, they know that I don't build track housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| I never have, never will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| I build homes that are in the medium to upper range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| Try to stay in the medium, sell, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| When we looked at this, we wanted to offer a vision of a wonderful location for homes because we've got growth coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7735)|
| 2:09:04| We know it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| It's coming from every direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7745)|
| 2:09:06| And we set aside the number of homes that we thought would be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| Now, the sector plan we know is for five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| That's not realistic in my world because I see what happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| So when I build on lots, I don't like 75 feet wide or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| They're very hard to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| They're very difficult, and they're very hard on the people who buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| But they're necessary in some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| In this case, I didn't think it was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| So if you'll notice, most of my lots are 85 feet wide by 130 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| We wanted some width so we could get some space in between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| It's a very large track of land, so it looks and appears that it's much closer than it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7779)|
| 2:09:46| We have carefully looked at several options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| We offered a very large event center clubhouse with pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| We've got a lot of acreage set aside for common area dog parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| and we've also set aside one of the lakefront properties for non-motorized access to the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7799)|
| 2:10:06| We have worked tirelessly with the MPC, the staff, to go over this plan diligently to make sure that it complies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7806)|
| 2:10:13| We're not asking to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| We're not asking for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| We're just asking for it to be approved in the concept that we thought would be fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7818)|
| 2:10:23| that we could build enough homes to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| But then again, at the same time, we give a lot of people an opportunity to build homes in residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| There's no apartments involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| There's no multifamily homes in portions of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| It's all residential, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| So I like to yield the rest of my time, just in case, let the opposition talk so we have other people that can speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| Thank you, Mr. Crispin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| Representatives for the neighborhood, name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| I'm Tim Vineyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| I reside at 8538 North Ruggles Ferry Pike, Strawberry Plains, Tennessee, 37871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| I reside at this location since 2016, and I am a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7856)|
| 2:11:03| First, I'd like to just first procedural rules just say that we object to being required to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7863)|
| 2:11:12| just because the developer has the burden of proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| It's fundamentally unfair for us to require the party without the burden of proof to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7875)|
| 2:11:22| Second of all, to be respectful of the commission's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| I request a postponement of this application to allow our community and its experts more time to review the new revised plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| We are prepared to provide the Planning Commission with an independent and undistorted traffic study from cannon to cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| but we were unable to obtain the study on such short notice over a holiday weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7900)|
| 2:11:45| An independent study will pay particular attention to the roadways and the intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7905)|
| 2:11:51| that will likely see traffic volumes increases from the proposed subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| but they were not analyzed as part of the original traffic impact study prepared for by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| Additionally, there were questions raised during your agenda review meeting about the location of sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| phasing of the project, and other matters that deserve further thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| There are also a number of commissioners, I believe four, that are not present today and are absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| We have certainly not been offered an open planning process embodied by your mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7939)|
| 2:12:26| Although the developer was granted several months of postponements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| the developer was unwilling to meet with the community until he proposed a revised plan that was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7949)|
| 2:12:37| For all these reasons, I yield to the commission for a vote to postpone at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| We had a similar situation like this last month, and I will explain to you as I explain to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7962)|
| 2:12:53| Use your time wisely and go ahead and discuss your concerns and opposition to the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7973)|
| 2:13:00| and once you're complete and the applicant has completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| then that will be up for commission to decide if they wanted to postpone the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7988)|
| 2:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7989)|
| 2:13:10| Thank you, Chairman Phillips and members of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| for allowing us to speak on behalf of opposition for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7993)|
| 2:13:17| I represent hundreds of fellow neighbors in a group we call Ruggles Ferry Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=7997)|
| 2:13:23| Several are in attendance today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| and I ask them to stand now and be recognized in front of the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| to show our unity in opposition to the Innsbruck Farms concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8009)|
| 2:13:35| And community, I ask you, how would you request NPC to vote on this application today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8015)|
| 2:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| Commissioners, we provided you a document, a PowerPoint slide deck that you have that my remarks will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8025)|
| 2:13:51| You can follow along with that since I was not allowed to be able to use PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| But I'll just start with the initial slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| I just wanted you to have those to be able to see all the remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| I won't go through every one of those, but we will hit some of the key reasons for opposition to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8044)|
| 2:14:10| We are united here in opposition to this concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8050)|
| 2:14:13| because we want to preserve and protect the rural character of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| The plan will have adverse impact, as noted already in the traffic study, on our traffic and our safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8058)|
| 2:14:25| The current plan does nothing to advance the policies embodied in our community planning documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8065)|
| 2:14:31| the general plan, the sector plans, and East Knox County plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| The plan will have an adverse impact on property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| Many of my neighbors, like myself, we selected this place as a very special place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| that it was an escape from a development just like this one that's being proposed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8085)|
| 2:14:50| Our community is receptive, and we're very open to growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8090)|
| 2:14:55| If this development had been 150 homes on this development property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| we wouldn't be here today, we would be very supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| and we would be welcoming new neighbors to our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| We are very open, and we expect growth, and we would like growth, but not this type of plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8106)|
| 2:15:13| This infrastructure and the lots, they should be appropriately sized and located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| to minimize the adverse impact such as danger or health and safety issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8119)|
| 2:15:25| population congestion, strain on utilities, and other public services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8125)|
| 2:15:30| otherwise scattered or premature development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| But this new development must be harmonious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| an asset for the community in keeping with other adopted plans, regulations, and design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8138)|
| 2:15:46| In our opinion, this is not the case for Innsbruck Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| We believe that this development is the largest in all of East Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8151)|
| 2:15:57| and one of the largest in Knox County's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8157)|
| 2:16:01| This is the largest in number of units in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| It's on 201 acres, and this plan leverages every square inch of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| to convert to housing without respect for the land and our current and surrounding community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8172)|
| 2:16:18| our environment, our infrastructure, our recreation, and our culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| And so just as we look at the key points for us why we oppose this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8183)|
| 2:16:31| I want to present to you why you should deny this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| The first one is density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| The density for this plan is completely out of alignment with our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| Our corridor is remarkable in its rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8202)|
| 2:16:46| If you've not visited there, we encourage you to go and do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| It's a beautiful place, and it's so convenient to downtown Knoxville and the surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8210)|
| 2:16:56| The existing development pattern is very low density, a minimum of one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8216)|
| 2:17:01| but there are many 3, 5, 7, 10-plus acre tracks, lots of farmlands, tons of open spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8221)|
| 2:17:09| The density harms the community in numerous ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| We believe it impacts negatively our property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8232)|
| 2:17:15| We believe that it will impact our utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| We already are challenged at times with water pressure, electrical, power, television, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8238)|
| 2:17:25| When there's a storm, we're going to lose power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| Additional demand on that is going to impact us with shared utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| The massive increase in traffic is a major concern for us, and that's resulting from the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| and we have concerns about safety as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| East Knox County's Community Plans Vision in 2017, their vision for tomorrow is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8264)|
| 2:17:51| develop 5-acre mini-farm subdivision developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| avoid greed and urban sprawl with poorly planned growth and wasted money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8275)|
| 2:18:02| balance between growth and preservation, keep it rural, listen to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| This plan does not comply with any of that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| This plan is not in alignment with subdivision regulations calling for areas to preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8290)|
| 2:18:15| mature woodlands and natural vegetation buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| The sector plan calls for protection of the open spaces and farms along Ruggles Ferry as a community asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8299)|
| 2:18:27| I draw your attention to the page that shows the development overlaid with an aerial view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8307)|
| 2:18:33| This picture is significant because it shows the density of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| and the impact on the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| The red line illustrates Ruggles Ferry Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| It's 7 miles in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| We couldn't show the entire picture in one shot, but this is pretty significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8329)|
| 2:18:54| and it mimics the surrounding county where this development is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| This plan is not harmonious with the area's rural culture, as this picture depicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| the adopted plans based upon sector plans and community plans, regulation of the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8345)|
| 2:19:12| Denial of this application is proper because you have before you a map showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8352)|
| 2:19:18| that the proposed density is not in harmony with the existing development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8358)|
| 2:19:25| In addition, I've already stated this is one of the largest projects, 475 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8365)|
| 2:19:32| The traffic study indicates 4,420 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| We believe it will be larger when we conduct the additional study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8376)|
| 2:19:42| This doubles the number of homes on Ruggles Ferry Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| in a short distance just within 201 acres of a 6,000-acre corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8386)|
| 2:19:53| In addition, inside the concept plan, it's not going to be pleasant for those who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8393)|
| 2:20:00| There are going to be negative impacts just getting in and out of the property where it's located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8400)|
| 2:20:05| getting from the front to the back of the property, 41 internal stop signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8405)|
| 2:20:11| What are we going to do about bus stops to pick up children, recreation, bicycles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8411)|
| 2:20:16| We see traffic, traffic, traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| That's our second point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| Why should you deny this plan is because of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| The pandemic impacted and distorted the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8425)|
| 2:20:29| We believe the work-at-home rules, the school closures, the layoffs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| the general anxiety of just people wanting to travel outside of their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| We believe that the traffic study was impacted also because they measured the west and east ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8438)|
| 2:20:44| of Ruggles Ferry with no consideration to the other corridor or connector roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| that allow people to go from Ruggles Ferry to the core highway, the actual highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8449)|
| 2:20:55| So we believe that that is impaired to understand and know that impact as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| Those connector roads were not considered, and we believe we need a more comprehensive data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8460)|
| 2:21:06| to support the traffic and safety impacts of this size and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| since this is the largest in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| We believe the bad data that we see today is about to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8473)|
| 2:21:18| The third reason that we believe that you should deny this plan is the safety factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| With increased traffic, with the density, we believe we'll bring other critical safety factors for our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| We value our properties for sure, but we value our families even more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| and we believe that the increased traffic here will not allow residents to utilize their property pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8494)|
| 2:21:40| for the safety of children playing in front yards, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8500)|
| 2:21:43| when you've got lots of cars speeding up velocity and the potential for accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| The East Knox County Sector Plan calls for Ruggles Ferry is a greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| developed as a greenway connector, and improved to safely accommodate both pedestrians and bicyclists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8514)|
| 2:22:02| And that traffic plan doesn't show that that's very hearty today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| Although this plan will more than double the existing traffic on our main road, Ruggles Ferry Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8526)|
| 2:22:12| the developer is not being asked to make any improvements on this main corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8532)|
| 2:22:18| Also, the developer has asked for variances for radius corners of the roads and intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| and there's no definite hardship provided there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| The fourth area of why we ask for you to deny this plan is the values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| We believe the precedent that this sets in our community will change the landscape of our corridor forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8551)|
| 2:22:38| We believe the density of this, the number of units, will radically change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| We've had multigenerational farmers that have given up the right to maximize their profits and land sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8562)|
| 2:22:49| to keep this community like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| The negative impacts of traffic, density, safety, we believe will have negative impacts on our property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8572)|
| 2:23:01| There's nowhere else to go, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| If we have to make improvements in the roads, it's coming off our properties and all these folks in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8583)|
| 2:23:09| Our community owns, the representatives of our community own 6,000 acres in this corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8589)|
| 2:23:16| 14 miles of Ruggles Ferry, 7 miles each way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| The developer owns 200 feet, and we're going to allow 200 feet to dictate 99.99% of the rest of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8600)|
| 2:23:29| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| The fifth reason is the connectivity to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| When this property was rezoned in 88, the community is now being tied to an intended use of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8614)|
| 2:23:45| that no longer aligns with the existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| The 88 zoning decision was made with the intention of connecting this property with the Ruggles Ferry Golf Course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8628)|
| 2:23:55| and includes a community park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| We believe that sector plans were not in place at that time, and so that's a layer of oversight such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8637)|
| 2:24:04| Last, not least, why should you deny this plan is number six, the burden to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8644)|
| 2:24:11| We have been forced to exhaust our resources, our funding, our time to engage not only in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8651)|
| 2:24:18| but we know now the future initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| We've sought out experts. We've retained counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| If approved, our community must go through the unattended and intended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8664)|
| 2:24:32| and burden of multiple years of phases of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| We've been communicated that this is a 10-year project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| The concept plan and the subdivision rules calls for five years, Section 2.07F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| However, we have to deal with heavy equipment, our roads tore up, mud, subcontractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8685)|

| 2:24:57| So the developer in our meeting on July 1st stated the math doesn't work to reduce the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8697)|
| 2:25:04| What is a math exercise to maximize profits for the developer impacts a way of life for us as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8704)|
| 2:25:12| This plan is not even close in being close in harmony with our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| and we request this application be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8717)|
| 2:25:21| And my last points are this, we realize this is a landmark decision for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8721)|
| 2:25:27| It's not easy. We understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| But what will the future citizens see when they drive by our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| I know what they see today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| They see an incredible part of the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| and I just ask that you do not put select profit over people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8739)|
| 2:25:45| We recognize that you're selected by our county and city mayors to do this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8745)|
| 2:25:50| We don't envy that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8750)|
| 2:25:51| We know it's very important for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| But please deny this plan because there is a legal and practical basis to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8753)|
| 2:25:59| This plan is not in harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| It has a flawed traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| There's potential harm to our property values and failure to make any other requested concessions that we ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8763)|
| 2:26:10| Inclusion of a public park is originally intended and other related impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| We ask for you to vote to deny this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8778)|
| 2:26:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8791)|
| 2:26:32| And I tell you, I appreciate the work that you guys put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| It's a lot of headaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| Mr. Harbin, your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| And I appreciate all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| I am David Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8800)|
| 2:26:41| I am the engineer and surveyor for this project here that Mr. Christman has asked me to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8801)|
| 2:26:46| And we prepared this concept plan that is before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8806)|
| 2:26:51| There's several things here that we do need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| There's been a lot of talk about the sector plan and what the sector plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8814)|
| 2:26:59| And I'll just go ahead and dive right into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| There's actually two things that guide you all in when you make these decisions right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8821)|
| 2:27:06| This is a new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| A development means change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| That's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| We're getting ready to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| And if you saw the newspaper article today, we need housing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8831)|
| 2:27:16| We need 40,000 new units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| And the question is, where do we want to take these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| So this property popped up here, and we took a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| The first thing I want to look at was the urban growth plan, the growth plan from several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8845)|
| 2:27:31| This thing is in the planned growth section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8851)|
| 2:27:35| Planners like you a number of years ago looked over Knoxville and decided which areas should be urban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8855)|
| 2:27:41| which areas should be in the county should be planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| This corridor was designated as planned growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| And in that, there were several goals here in that urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| It said to encourage a pattern of compact and contiguous development guided into urban areas and to planned growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8871)|
| 2:27:58| Another one was to take into consideration such matters that may be logically related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| or to form an integral part of the plan for the coordinated, efficient, and orderly development of the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8883)|
| 2:28:10| And finally, the last part of it was to provide a variety of housing choices to assure affordable housing for future population growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8890)|
| 2:28:19| This area is within the planned growth area of the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8899)|
| 2:28:24| The next thing we look at is the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| This area is designated as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8906)|
| 2:28:31| And in reading straight from the red spot right here, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| the planning staff prepares a background report about the sector containing basic planning information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8914)|
| 2:28:39| about the environmental resources, the land use, the population, transportation, community facilities, and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8919)|
| 2:28:47| With, this is one on the inside, with public input, the planning staff then drafts a conceptual 15-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8927)|
| 2:28:54| that includes goals, policies, and proposals to guide the sector's growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8934)|
| 2:28:58| The focus of the plan is physical development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| Consequently, land use, transportation, community facilities are its key elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| The adopted plan will be used as a month-to-month basis by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| as a guide to zoning and subdivision decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| This is in the low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| And from the website here, the low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| this type is primarily residential in character with densities in the county of five dwelling units or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8960)|
| 2:29:27| This development, this development is at less than two and a half units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8967)|
| 2:29:33| I think it's such a large tract of land, it's a big piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| And we didn't, we could have come in here with 30 or 40 acres and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| I don't know what we want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| But at planning staff, they always tell us, show us your entire plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8985)|
| 2:29:49| Let us look at the entire plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| And it's just big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| It's a lot of acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8992)|
| 2:29:53| But if you look at the total density, it's down to two and a half units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| In the location criteria of the low-density residential, it asks for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| It says it needs land that is served by water and sewer utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9002)|
| 2:30:06| We have the letter from KEB stating that their water and their sewer services out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9006)|
| 2:30:11| are either adequate or will be adequate by the time we need it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| They're taking care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9014)|
| 2:30:15| Utility infrastructure will be getting better out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| Collector roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| Rebels Ferry Park is a major collector road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| It's 24 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| It has shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| It's one of the best roads in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| And slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| No way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| No way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| Please keep your comments to yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9036)|
| 2:30:38| The applicant is speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| It is a 24-foot wide road with shoulders, strides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9040)|
| 2:30:47| It is a fine road to handle this type of development, as our traffic impact study said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| And finally, and not less than slopes that are less than 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| It's rare to find a piece of land without power lines, without sinkholes, without streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9057)|
| 2:31:04| There's one stream that we'll have the buffer on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| We put that in common area, so we'll keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| But this, actually, the slopes are very gentle out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| I rarely see a piece of property, topography-wise, that matches this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9074)|
| 2:31:21| So using those tools, you have to make a decision that what is appropriate out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9081)|
| 2:31:27| I say that we're harmonious with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| We're harmonious with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| And we've presented you a plan that is harmonious with the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9092)|
| 2:31:38| We've presented you a plan that's harmonious with the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| And so we are in agreement with the 17 conditions that staff has placed on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| So we just ask and urge your approval for this plan today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| So I can answer any questions you all may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9113)|
| 2:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9114)|
| 2:31:58| Commissioners, Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9118)|
| 2:32:02| I have one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| I'll probably have some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9124)|
| 2:32:05| There is—and this is going to be for our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| So if you can zoom in on that property down near Ruggles Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9127)|
| 2:32:14| There is a section there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| It's labeled as plot 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| So keep going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| You're going to have to zoom way in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| It's actually, according to the KGIS, it's owned by the Vance family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9142)|
| 2:32:28| And talking with some of the neighbors, the Vances are not selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9148)|
| 2:32:34| But I'm curious why there are three acres as part of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9154)|
| 2:32:38| Sure, I can help answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| That was part of the original submittal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| They actually had a road, a second road coming down through their property to connect to the Burris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9162)|
| 2:32:56| Subsequently, during revisions, they took that out of their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| So that parcel was part of the original submittal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9179)|
| 2:33:02| That's why it's shown on our map, but it's no longer part of their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9182)|
| 2:33:11| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9191)|
| 2:33:15| Yeah, I've got a question for the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9195)|
| 2:33:21| 428 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| You obviously don't plan on building all this at once, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9202)|
| 2:33:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9206)|
| 2:33:27| What is your plan phasing-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| The plan, when we discussed it with Knox County Planning, was that our T-deck allows 50 acres at a time disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9209)|
| 2:33:36| But Knox County wants 25, so we were somewhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9216)|
| 2:33:39| So what we found was that roughly, if we work in a six-phase system, we're going to run in six phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9219)|
| 2:33:46| That way we can operate in roughly around 30, that way we can stabilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| Because the good news is that the land is soft and it's gentle, so we're not anticipating high runoff, which we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9230)|
| 2:33:57| So we felt like we started with a three-phase system, but we went to a six-phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9237)|
| 2:34:01| That allows us to meet Knox County and T-deck requirements so that we can go at a controlled rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9241)|
| 2:34:08| Okay, so I think one of the big deals with this is anytime you see 428 lots, everybody's freaking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9248)|
| 2:34:18| 470.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| But if you were doing 20 acres at a time and you came in here and asked for approval on 20 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| I don't think that it would be quite as scary, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| And so your plan is to go and do 25 acres at a time approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9271)|
| 2:34:36| Approximately, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| And so I would guess you're probably looking at a year, a little over a year to get it built, even if you get approved and get started, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9278)|
| 2:34:46| I would assume, depending on how long it takes to pull permits, we'll move as quick as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9286)|
| 2:34:51| And then you're not going to wait, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9293)|
| 2:34:54| Absorption-wise, I mean, that's going to be, what, 70 lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| So, I mean, when I look at this, this is a ten-year deal, it looks like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9297)|
| 2:35:02| Is that in your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| Well, the anticipation is hopefully to go faster, but we don't know what that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9305)|
| 2:35:10| But, yes, you're probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| You're probably looking between six to ten is what we're guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| But that's only because we're controlled on how many acres we can disturb at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| If we were allowed to go faster, we would, we probably would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| But we also have to get it sold, and we want to minimize the impact to the environment and to the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9324)|
| 2:35:30| If you can't build 400 houses at one time, it's almost impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9330)|
| 2:35:35| Can you speak to us at all about your road improvements, and when will those improvements take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9335)|
| 2:35:42| When are you going to be required to spend money on the road system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9342)|
| 2:35:46| The first two phases, I believe, David, we're going to be roughly the first 149 lots will be part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9346)|
| 2:35:55| We have to improve Blake Lane before the 150th can begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9355)|
| 2:36:03| So that road has got to be widened to at least 20 feet wide to meet specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9363)|
| 2:36:08| These roads are not going to be part of Innsbruck Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| They're going to be part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| So we're going to build them as per county specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| We will comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| We've always complied with them from the start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| So they told us what we have to have because we don't want to further burden Innsbruck Farm residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9378)|
| 2:36:22| with that homeowner association that would actually have to maintain roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9382)|
| 2:36:25| So Knox County will take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| But we will improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| We will do everything as required as per the county committee, I mean the roads and the superintendent tells us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9388)|
| 2:36:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| That's it for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9398)|
| 2:36:39| And we added that second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| If you notice, we added a second entrance off the end of Blake Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9400)|
| 2:36:44| The original plan had this single entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9404)|
| 2:36:47| We had two entrances off Burris, but it didn't really comply because Burris and the Innsbruck entrance collided at a main intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9407)|
| 2:36:54| and that would have burdened the rest of the development getting out should there be something that would block that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9414)|
| 2:36:58| So we put another entrance on Blake Lane and made it more feasible so we have two entrances, one on the front and one to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9418)|
| 2:37:06| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9426)|
| 2:37:10| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| I have a couple of questions that I want to involve our legal counsel because I think it's important for the public to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9432)|
| 2:37:20| one, that we are bound to a very specific criteria when we look at these concept plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9440)|
| 2:37:26| and just because we say that we don't want to see this in your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9446)|
| 2:37:34| that doesn't give us a reason to vote to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9454)|
| 2:37:41| So I hope everyone understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9461)|
| 2:37:44| Another thing I want you to understand that we have a very—and this is not an excuse, but it's an explanation—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9464)|
| 2:37:50| we have a very pretty new group here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9470)|
| 2:37:54| I'm probably the fourth most senior commissioner on here, two of which this is their first meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210708?start=9474)|
