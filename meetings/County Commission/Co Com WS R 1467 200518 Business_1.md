| 2:27:09| creating a resolution regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8835)|
| 2:27:16| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| A number of things that we look at all the time and we talk about, well, they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| going to challenge this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| We're not going to have this thing occur against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| But if you look right now under this coronavirus that we're under, the 14th Amendment has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| really walked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8856)|
| 2:27:37| We have given up so many rights under this that's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8857)|
| 2:27:44| And I appreciate that the two commissioners said, you know, we're going to confirm the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| Second Amendment, which is to protect us not from each other, but from the government which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| governs us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| And at this point in time, a lot of people are worried about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| And it's just saying we assert your right to have this amendment for your protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8878)|
| 2:28:09| against overbearing government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| And I think that's one of the things that a lot of people want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| And the thing about something else about will this affect future commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8895)|
| 2:28:21| Well, any time that you pass anything that goes more than five years, you've affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8901)|
| 2:28:26| a commissioner that's coming into an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| And we do that a number of times where we do resolutions on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| Now, whether we support it or we don't support it, the thing of it is the people want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| know where you stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| They brought this up and they're going to ask the question, where do you stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| And I know where I'm going to stand and what I want to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| It means it has no teeth in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| But it does say we support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights for the people of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8930)|
| 2:28:55| United States, for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8935)|
| 2:28:58| It includes everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| Commissioner Gill, I see your blue hand is still raised over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8945)|
| 2:29:08| I'm not sure if you desire me to come back to you or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8951)|
| 2:29:12| And Commissioner Daley, I see that you wanted to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| I got, if you don't mind, I might take a little chair's privilege just to mention something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8959)|
| 2:29:20| And I'll admit that on the front end, I'm being a little bit nitpicky on this one because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8960)|
| 2:29:27| there's so, this resolution, there's so much to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| I mean, it's kind of like hiring a first year law student to justify a brief or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8971)|
| 2:29:37| like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8977)|
| 2:29:38| And it didn't make sense to me on the front end until I started reading it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| from the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| I almost feel like it's upside down in that the part that we've talked about and debated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8985)|
| 2:29:52| the most is actually on the last page, which in the last sentence on it, where we've talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8992)|
| 2:29:59| about how everything is subject to the Supreme Court, the Tennessee Supreme Court and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| Tennessee General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9004)|
| 2:30:06| And then it kind of, it almost, this whole resolution almost reads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9006)|
| 2:30:12| It's almost, if I were doing it, I would have started with that and then added anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9012)|
| 2:30:18| else into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| So it just seems a little bit, and I could nitpick on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9020)|
| 2:30:24| And once again, I'm just now kind of getting into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9024)|
| 2:30:26| I was following it closely just because I saw a lot of other counties passing these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| and it was on my radar back at the first year, but it's really not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9030)|
| 2:30:36| So I guess I appreciate the motion that we have to send forward no recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9036)|
| 2:30:41| So at least speaking for myself, I can research this and look into it a little bit more, make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9041)|
| 2:30:46| sure we don't have any unintended outcomes or anything on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9046)|
| 2:30:50| But boy, it's an awful lot of stuff on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| So with that said, going back to you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| This resolution, the law department and I said, and I believe the law director, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9065)|
| 2:31:12| it was Mr. Sturkey that went through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| He checked everything out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9075)|
| 2:31:16| Anything that was not factual in the original resolution that came from the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9076)|
| 2:31:24| counties that had been passed, it was vetted by our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| And things that were not, could be justified or proven were taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9088)|
| 2:31:34| So this is, like I say, all this is, is something and let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9094)|
| 2:31:40| I agree with Commissioner Buster totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| This COVID-19 has changed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| We gave away a lot of our rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| We just got an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9108)|
| 2:31:49| If you, you know, if you'd read your email, we got an email from a lady that says the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9109)|
| 2:31:53| health department has got too much power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| Where is she getting, where is Dr. Buchanan getting all this power from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| And, you know, and for everyone, I'll let everyone know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9120)|
| 2:32:03| I've asked the law department for a, to research and see what the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9123)|
| 2:32:11| what powers the health department have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| That's, that's a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| And it's not talking about the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| This is back, I just want to say in the law department, they want to confirm how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| hours, they spent hours on vetting this resolution out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9141)|
| 2:32:26| And so I feel very comfortable with the wording because our law department has vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9146)|
| 2:32:33| everything on this, this resolution and it's non-binding resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9153)|
| 2:32:38| Vote yes or vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9158)|
| 2:32:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9165)|
| 2:32:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9166)|
| 2:32:47| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| And I'm looking out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| Are there any other commissioners that want to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| I think once again, you know, we're not technically voting on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9173)|
| 2:32:57| The motion on the floor was to send forward with no recommendation actually vote on next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| Any other commissioners have a question, a clarifier or any other follow up on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9183)|
| 2:33:10| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll for the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9192)|

| 2:43:10| and affirm the resolution, because it is part of a series of things that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9790)|
| 2:43:17| that we report to HUD as steps towards affirmatively furthering fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| We will have obviously a contract coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9803)|
| 2:43:27| for annual action plan in the next couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| And there might be a chance to recognize some of the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9811)|
| 2:43:35| that support this work during the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| But if Commission was comfortable going ahead and approving the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| we would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| And we'll make certain that that's contained in our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9823)|
| 2:43:47| what's called a CAPER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9827)|
| 2:43:48| our Comprehensive Annual Performance Evaluation and Review that we submit to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| Okay, so we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9832)|

| 2:44:59| I want to hearken back to the presentation y'all gave last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| Again, that was really informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9901)|
| 2:45:04| So thank you for the work that your team is doing to help us with affordable housing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9904)|
| 2:45:08| in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9908)|
| 2:45:12| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| The next item is number 53, discussion and update on the Knox County budget vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9914)|
| 2:45:21| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9921)|
| 2:45:22| I'm the one who put this on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9922)|
| 2:45:23| And as we heard earlier in the evening, I believe Mr. Harry stated that the mayor was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9923)|
| 2:45:31| going to be making his budget presentation on June 1st, which is the, I guess, the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| possible day that by our charter, he can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9936)|
| 2:45:42| My initial plan, I'm just going to throw this out here, kind of my initial plan, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| can talk about this and see how we want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9945)|
| 2:45:48| But there's so many moving parts in trying to forecast state revenues and local revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9948)|
| 2:45:54| that the prudent thing seemed to be to wait until the last possible minute to do our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9954)|
| 2:46:00| vote so that it'll be the most succinct and the most accurate based on the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9960)|
| 2:46:07| that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| So just to kind of state some obvious, when we look at June, June is a 1, 2, 3, 4, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9970)|
| 2:46:17| a 5 Monday month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| So we've already got our work session scheduled for the 15th and our board of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9979)|
| 2:46:26| meeting is going to be coming up on the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9986)|
| 2:46:29| And the mayor is planning on making his budget presentation to us and the community on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9994)|
| 2:46:35| So, you know, my initial thoughts on this were, you know, that could allow the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9995)|
| 2:46:39| to make his budget presentation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| And when he's presenting to us, ultimately, he's really presenting it to the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10001)|
| 2:46:45| And then that would give us as a body, two specific meetings to discuss and deliberate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10005)|
| 2:46:52| on that with our both of our the work session and our regular board of commissioners meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10012)|
| 2:46:57| with the possibility for a budget vote that Monday, the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10017)|
| 2:47:02| So that was my initial thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10022)|
| 2:47:05| And I think based and grant, I think I spoke with the mayor's office about this potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10025)|
| 2:47:10| schedule a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10030)|
| 2:47:11| But I would guess that they're probably still comfortable with the budget vote, maybe on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| the 29th, but wanted to kind of go to you guys and see your take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10035)|
| 2:47:20| If you think we need to add in some extra public meetings, just kind of get that ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| rolling right now so we can get that schedule set in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| So, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10049)|
| 2:47:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10052)|
| 2:47:32| I think it's I think we have to have a public meeting anyway, wouldn't it be after the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| session be appropriate for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10056)|
| 2:47:38| And I mean, 29th is awful close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| I mean, we got to talk about the ramifications if it doesn't get passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10061)|
| 2:47:45| I mean, I think it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| I mean, he's he's opened himself office up to us twice for meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10066)|
| 2:47:51| And I think we'll probably have a few questions because we know there's the revenue issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| But we'll have to make sure we schedule that public meeting, I believe, probably on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10075)|
| 2:48:00| work session on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| Okay, Mr. Anders, any other follow up on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| Okay, Mr. Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10087)|

| 2:48:10| I think that's a great idea to have it on Monday, June 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10090)|
| 2:48:16| Has the mayor's office decided what time they're going to do the budget presentation on June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10096)|
| 2:48:22| the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10102)|

| 2:48:41| And we'll of course do it via video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10121)|
| 2:48:45| But we'll make a formal announcement next week on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| Okay, likely in the morning on the 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10129)|
| 2:48:52| Yes, yes, as early as possible, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10136)|
| 2:48:57| So, Dr. Sillip, you heard what Commissioner Anders said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10137)|
| 2:49:02| Can you get in the pipeline, the process to get a public hearing on the budget to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10142)|
| 2:49:09| place probably at 7 or immediately following the county work session on the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10149)|
| 2:49:17| I will take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10157)|
| 2:49:18| I'll get with Sunny and PBA and get that scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10158)|

| 2:49:26| I mean, I think that seems pretty reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| I know that Chris has been pretty accessible as we're all trying to figure out this forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10168)|
| 2:49:33| And we'll probably be talking about different numbers in three weeks than our current forecast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10173)|
| 2:49:38| right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10178)|
| 2:49:39| So, unless I hear otherwise, obviously, if we have to make a tweak or change, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10179)|
| 2:49:45| do that through the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| But that's kind of the timeline that we'll roll with, knowing that we'll have two good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10187)|
| 2:49:53| meetings in June that we can dedicate a lot of time to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10193)|
| 2:49:57| And if need be, we can, you know, hopefully, if you think we need more after you've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10197)|
| 2:50:03| a chance maybe to meet with the mayor or Chris, then we can try to set up another budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10203)|
| 2:50:08| But I would like to think that that should be enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10208)|
| 2:50:14| So, you know, so that's the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| All right, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| The next item is, let's see, number 54 was deferred, number 55, discussion item regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10219)|
| 2:50:30| the hospital guideline during COVID-19 pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| I think, as I said, that to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| Well, we move that to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| And I think we clarified that with Commissioner Bussler earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| So, Commissioner Bussler, you're good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10240)|
| 2:50:43| So, yes, I thought we mentioned that a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10243)|
| 2:50:49| We did, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10252)|
| 2:50:52| So, item 56, discussion item regarding new regulations for stormwater detention ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10252)|
| 2:50:57| and testing water for contamination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10257)|
| 2:51:02| Okay, I know, I think the quote Commissioner Daley from earlier in the meeting, he didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10262)|
| 2:51:06| want to steal Charlie's thunder on this particular item since we talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10266)|
| 2:51:10| I think on item 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10270)|
| 2:51:13| But I'll go ahead and recognize Commissioner Biggs on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10273)|
| 2:51:17| I would, this is actually pertaining to previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10277)|
| 2:51:20| I was just wondering from my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10280)|
| 2:51:22| Have we ever seen when cable TV is going to meet again off the last month's discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10282)|
| 2:51:30| and things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10290)|
| 2:51:31| I was just wondering if maybe, you know, I know I saw just speaking freehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| I know I saw some emails from like the new go to person for one of the providers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10295)|
| 2:51:40| I'm not on that committee, but I don't know if they're, I'm not sure if y'all want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10300)|
| 2:51:46| anybody from the cable committee want to kind of provide an update on where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10306)|
| 2:51:49| It was some good motion movement coming out of that from our last meeting and based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| the emails that I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10314)|
| 2:51:55| Yeah, if I may, Mr. Chairman, we, I mean, since the cable TV committee consists of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10315)|
| 2:52:02| entire commission, Commissioner Jay, who's the vice chair and I felt that it was best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10322)|
| 2:52:07| to have the meeting on a regular meeting day rather than bring the whole commission together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10327)|
| 2:52:12| on a different day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10332)|
| 2:52:14| And the first available was the July work session, which is July 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10334)|
| 2:52:19| And so the plan is for the cable TV committee to meet on the afternoon of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10339)|
| 2:52:23| I'm sorry, July 20th, which is the work session date for July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10343)|
| 2:52:27| And we will convene the cable TV committee at either three or three 30 on that Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10347)|
| 2:52:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10354)|
| 2:52:35| Have you guys worked it all out with your sillitude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| We have, we have right now, the only room available is the commission conference room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| because the plan is for the courts to, I believe, use the main assembly room through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10362)|
| 2:52:49| a certain date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10369)|
| 2:52:51| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10371)|
| 2:52:52| But we're playing that by ear because if the small assembly were to open up, that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10372)|
| 2:52:56| be a better location than the commission conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| But for now that's facility, it has been secured for the meeting if we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10378)|
| 2:53:05| And Commissioner Wheeler, I think we discussed 3pm because this is the first time this has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10385)|
| 2:53:09| met in some time and we felt like we were going to have presentations and meet the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10389)|
| 2:53:14| So yes, I think we said three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10394)|
| 2:53:17| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10397)|
| 2:53:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10397)|
| 2:53:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10397)|
| 2:53:18| We have already reached out to Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10398)|
| 2:53:19| They will have a representative there and we intend to reach out to the other cable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10399)|
| 2:53:22| internet providers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10402)|
| 2:53:24| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10406)|
| 2:53:26| That's, I'm really glad to see that moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10406)|
| 2:53:29| It's one of those committees that, you know, you get on and when you first get on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| and then you wonder what, what's going to happen here, you know, so that's, I'm glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10412)|
| 2:53:37| to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10417)|
| 2:53:38| So, uh, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10418)|
| 2:53:40| That, uh, and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10420)|
| 2:53:42| Biggs, you brought that up, but I want to go back to, we were transitioning into discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10422)|
| 2:53:46| item 56, which was a follow-up around regulations for stormwater detention ponds and testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10426)|
| 2:53:52| waterfront contamination that was brought back to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| Buster's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10434)|
| 2:53:55| And once again, I know, uh, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| Daly, we had talked about that a little earlier in the meeting on one particular, uh, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10437)|
| 2:54:02| engineering item, but I wanted to make sure that we gave this its fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| If there's any additional clarification for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| Stone or any additional questions that may have popped up since we talked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| earlier, uh, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| And I'm going to pass it to commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10458)|
| 2:54:19| Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10459)|
| 2:54:20| The reason why I brought this on here was that there is some issues going on at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| state level that detention ponds are not going to be handled through the, uh, uh, the POAs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10465)|
| 2:54:33| or HOAs or things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10473)|
| 2:54:35| It's going to drop right into the stormwater drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10475)|
| 2:54:39| Now, it's already happening in other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10479)|
| 2:54:44| Now it's going to cost us money to go and oversee all these detention ponds that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10484)|
| 2:54:50| have that we need to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10490)|
| 2:54:53| We had an issue not too long ago that there was a sewer line broke and they pumped raw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10493)|
| 2:54:58| sewage into a detention pond that flowed into a stream that flowed into Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10498)|
| 2:55:06| They went back to test it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10506)|
| 2:55:07| One part of the pond was at the level of the eco line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10507)|
| 2:55:12| The other was way above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| But they said because one end was not right, it made that one subdivision have some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10514)|
| 2:55:22| because kids played in that detention pond with that, after that raw sewage was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10522)|
| 2:55:28| Now, that's some of the issues that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| That's going to fall back on Jim Snowden and his group to look at these detention ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10531)|
| 2:55:38| when they fill up and we take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| And it's going to be a budgeting issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10540)|
| 2:55:43| And that's what I wanted to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10543)|
| 2:55:45| Those are some things that are on the line at the state level that says the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10545)|
| 2:55:49| are not responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| That will be the counties because they're in charge of stormwater drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10551)|
| 2:55:55| And that's all I wanted to mention about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| Thank you for giving me an opportunity to mention those things that we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10557)|
| 2:56:01| to budget for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10563)|
| 2:56:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10564)|
| 2:56:05| I see Commissioner Biggs and then Commissioner Daley, if y'all want to weigh in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10565)|
| 2:56:09| And then we may want to also circle back to Jim Snowden to see if he's included that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10569)|
| 2:56:13| some of his future budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10573)|
| 2:56:14| But go ahead, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10574)|
| 2:56:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10577)|
| 2:56:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10577)|
| 2:56:18| My question was actually to Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| Is there any way I could get a copy of that specific case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10581)|
| 2:56:26| That's just concerning considering everything that Justin Bailey's done with the flotilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10586)|
| 2:56:31| And I'm not 100% sure, but I think I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| I think Commissioner Jay even kayaked that beaver creek and helped clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10593)|
| 2:56:38| Many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10600)|
| 2:56:40| The situation only happened about a month and a half or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10600)|
| 2:56:45| I called Jim Snowden on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| We went out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10607)|
| 2:56:48| They took a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| But there was raw sewage and quite a bit amount pumped into that detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10611)|
| 2:56:56| And later it was rained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10616)|
| 2:56:57| And then it was released out through the detention pond itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10617)|
| 2:57:01| They had originally covered it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| The drainage pipe that went across the road that finally fed it down into Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10624)|
| 2:57:09| But we did have Hossdale Powell to come out and check it a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10629)|
| 2:57:15| But there was a larger amount than what they wanted to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10635)|
| 2:57:21| That went out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10641)|
| 2:57:22| And what I'm saying in the future, the county is going to be responsible for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10642)|
| 2:57:28| So it's already been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10648)|
| 2:57:31| They've done their shake and bake of whatever they want to do out there to tell you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10651)|
| 2:57:36| it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10656)|
| 2:57:37| But it's not all right when you pump raw sewage out into the detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10657)|
| 2:57:44| But if you're worried about it, Jim Snowden has already been looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10664)|
| 2:57:51| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10671)|
| 2:57:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| Commissioner Biggs, you got a follow up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10675)|
| 2:57:56| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10676)|
| 2:57:57| I was just a concerned citizen that would send an email in like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10677)|
| 2:58:01| I'd like to have just seen it and maybe seen what area it was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10681)|
| 2:58:04| Because that's concerning, knowing the amount of work we've put into the Powell area down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10684)|
| 2:58:09| there, the flotilla and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10689)|
| 2:58:10| But that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10690)|
| 2:58:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10691)|
| 2:58:11| Thank you, Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10691)|
| 2:58:12| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10692)|
| 2:58:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10694)|
| 2:58:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10694)|
| 2:58:15| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10695)|
| 2:58:18| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10698)|
| 2:58:19| I think Commissioner Daley, I think, weighed in earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| So I'm sorry, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| Your light turned on a little sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10703)|
| 2:58:24| Sorry, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10707)|
| 2:58:28| Carson's waving it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10708)|
| 2:58:28| So back to you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| OK, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| It's a scene of Director Snowden is still on the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10712)|
| 2:58:36| If you could explain just, I think, at the beginning, the discussion early on in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10716)|
| 2:58:39| meeting, it was trying to understand the process of who owns the ponds after we certify it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10719)|
| 2:58:46| and who maintains them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10726)|
| 2:58:47| And then if you could also talk about what kind of enforcement mechanisms are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10727)|
| 2:58:52| if somebody violates or if something like this happens sewage wise or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10732)|
| 2:58:57| But if you could talk about who owns and maintains the ponds after we certify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10737)|
| 2:59:01| Are they the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| Are they the portion of Mox County only if they're in the right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| Or are they at the HOA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10746)|
| 2:59:08| And then what are the inspection processes and violation or enforcement processes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10748)|
| 2:59:15| Sure, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| We require the detention ponds or we strongly encourage detention ponds to be within a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10757)|
| 2:59:23| drainage easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| Oftentimes on older subdivisions, you'll see them on individual lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10765)|
| 2:59:30| And that's a pretty large burden to be putting on one landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10770)|
| 2:59:34| So we strongly encourage folks and most folks do place them on a common area to where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10774)|
| 2:59:43| HOA has to maintain them per the maintenance agreements that you guys approve routinely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10783)|
| 2:59:49| each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10789)|
| 2:59:50| Our stormwater ordinance codifies the maintenance responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10790)|
| 2:59:57| They are deferred to the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10797)|
| 2:59:59| What Commissioner Bussler is referring to is some litigation that is still pending at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10799)|
| 3:00:05| the state level regarding the NPGS general permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10805)|
| 3:00:13| Once we still are a little bit unsure on how that permit will affect what we call permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10813)|
| 3:00:19| stormwater management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| There are six minimum control measures that we have to comply with, one of which is permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10821)|
| 3:00:27| stormwater management, which is detention ponds and devices that treat both the quantity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10827)|
| 3:00:35| and the quality of the water leaving that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10835)|
| 3:00:39| So once that rule is complete, we'll have a little better idea about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10839)|
| 3:00:43| But it is our anticipation that those things will still be the responsibility of the landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10843)|
| 3:00:50| And then if they choose not to, you know, follow through with those requirements, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10850)|
| 3:00:56| ordinance gives us the ability to go upon that property, do that work, and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10856)|
| 3:01:01| bill or put a place of lien on their property to recoup the county tax dollars that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10861)|
| 3:01:07| expensed to comply with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10867)|
| 3:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10873)|
| 3:01:14| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10874)|
| 3:01:15| Back to you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10877)|
| 3:01:21| First of all, thank you, Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10881)|
| 3:01:23| One of our, I tell people and I brag on two people or two departments for sure in Norris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10883)|

| 3:01:34| I think they do more with less than anybody that I've ever seen in the quality of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10894)|
| 3:01:39| work coming out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10899)|
| 3:01:39| And I have no doubt that, you know, the stormwater aspect, the reason I asked that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10899)|
| 3:01:46| and Charlie, I'm glad he brought it up, there is a development that's going on in the ninth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10906)|
| 3:01:54| district that the detention pond is starting to get a third full from the runoff and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10914)|
| 3:02:01| developers doing everything correctly, I do believe that as much rain that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10921)|
| 3:02:07| we've got mud flowing into the detention pond, rising the level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10927)|
| 3:02:12| And now we're going to have, we have much rain, we're going to have that same flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10932)|
| 3:02:15| problem across the road into the neighbor's yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10935)|
| 3:02:18| So that's the reason I brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10938)|
| 3:02:20| And I guess my question, final question, Jim, is besides thank you, is that do we have anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10940)|
| 3:02:28| that's, say a development's been shut down for three months, six months to a year, do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10948)|
| 3:02:35| we have anybody to go out and check the flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| Or is that just when a citizen says, hey, we got a flooding problem, can you come look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10957)|
| 3:02:43| at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10963)|
| 3:02:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| Yes, Commissioner Dale, we actually, required by our NPS permit, we're required to do 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10967)|
| 3:02:54| day or monthly inspections on all open grading sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10974)|
| 3:02:58| So if you've got a grading permit in Knox County and you're disturbing earth, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10978)|
| 3:03:02| a inspector that's there checking all those erosion control measures for compliance, adequacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10982)|
| 3:03:10| things like that within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10990)|
| 3:03:13| So we should be catching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| And if you don't care to share that location with me, I'll be more than happy to give it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10995)|
| 3:03:19| an extra set of closer examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=10999)|
| 3:03:24| All right, good follow up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11004)|
| 3:03:27| I've got Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11007)|
| 3:03:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11010)|
| 3:03:31| I was trying to follow Commissioner Bussler's story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11011)|
| 3:03:35| So am I to assume that Halsdale Powell Utility District employees were pumping sewage into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11015)|
| 3:03:43| a residential basin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11023)|
| 3:03:48| Is that what I'm heard you to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| Or who actually did all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11030)|
| 3:03:55| Yes, it did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11035)|
| 3:03:59| They had a pipe that had been a sewage pipe that had been leaking for some time and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11039)|
| 3:04:05| caused a sinkhole to get to the pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11045)|
| 3:04:08| They had to pump that sewage out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| And when they pumped it out, it went into the stormwater drainage in that subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11051)|
| 3:04:15| which goes into the detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| We were out there, we took a look at it and I was upset with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11059)|
| 3:04:23| And when it does rain and you go back out there, there is a green kind of ooze that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11063)|
| 3:04:29| on top of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| But they say it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11071)|
| 3:04:32| They said they've been out there and they've tested it a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| And there is supposedly a level that you can have that in that detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11075)|
| 3:04:46| You're going to have E. coli in it anyway because of waste from animals that gets into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11090)|
| 3:04:50| But when you have the human raw sewage that they pumped out to get to the sewage pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11090)|
| 3:04:54| to fix it, that's a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11094)|
| 3:04:58| But that's been taken care of and I'm watching it every day to make sure that it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11098)|
| 3:05:02| get any worse than what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| But again, we're going to be responsible for those detention ponds that's been there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11105)|
| 3:05:13| numbers of years that have filled up, backflowed and everything else with this kind of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11113)|
| 3:05:20| passes because the individual that owns that should not have the burden for the rest of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11120)|
| 3:05:26| the subdivision or the development he's in to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11126)|
| 3:05:31| And a lot of that is on the property owner's land that goes ahead and gives it to the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11131)|
| 3:05:38| that's closest to that detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11138)|
| 3:05:40| And that's the kind of legislation that's down in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11140)|
| 3:05:44| Again, they'll probably require us to take a look at more of those that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11144)|
| 3:05:51| that kind of situation arise again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| Okay, well, and then my follow up question is to Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| Was the state of Tennessee aware of this and did they sign off on doing something of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11160)|
| 3:06:05| kind of procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| Yes, Commissioner, Halsdale-Powell actually is required by permit, their permit to self| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11167)|
| 3:06:13| report that sanitary sewer overflow and we also reported it to TDEX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| So yeah, it was dual reported by both folks and it was my understanding that what Halsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11178)|
| 3:06:26| did, they plugged the detention basin to where water wouldn't flow out because the sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11186)|
| 3:06:32| was leaking and they had to repair it and the safest place to put it wasn't in the detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11192)|
| 3:06:37| pond, but they plugged the pond so that no water or sewage would get out, cleaned it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11197)|
| 3:06:43| up and then reopened the pond was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11203)|
| 3:06:47| So they did try to do, I guess, a due diligence effort to try to minimize downstream impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11207)|
| 3:06:55| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11215)|
| 3:06:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11216)|
| 3:06:57| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11217)|
| 3:06:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11217)|
| 3:06:58| I'm going to, not an effort to beat a dead horse on this one, but you know, there may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11218)|
| 3:07:02| be folks who are tuning in who don't, you know, we've got retention ponds, you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11222)|
| 3:07:06| construction site ponds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11226)|
| 3:07:07| Jim, just for all of us who maybe aren't out with, you know, out with developers or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11227)|
| 3:07:12| whatnot, you know, sometimes I've commonly had, since we're on this subject before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11232)|
| 3:07:17| wrap up, you often have questions about now, you know, when a construction site is under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11237)|
| 3:07:22| construction, is it plugged, is it ready to drain, you know, is it more of a construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11242)|
| 3:07:27| site retention pond versus something long-term that is allowed to drain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| Could you just kind of clarify how that all, how those different types of basins are set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11250)|
| 3:07:36| up, whether they've got a plug in them, where they don't, where they're allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| drain freely, just for, just a refresher for all of us and anybody who may be tuning in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11259)|
| 3:07:46| Sure, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11266)|
| 3:07:47| Yeah, it gets confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| Detention ponds, we're detaining water, and that's the permanent condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| Typically, that pond holds it and releases it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11274)|
| 3:07:58| A retention pond holds it indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11278)|
| 3:08:02| It never leaves the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11282)|
| 3:08:04| It has to infiltrate, and that is what occurs on a construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11284)|
| 3:08:11| T-DEC requires a permanent condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11291)|
| 3:08:13| And that is what occurs on a construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11293)|
| 3:08:17| T-DEC requires us to keep ponds plugged until the entire, well, 70% uniform stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11297)|
| 3:08:26| So, that's why during a subdivision, as homes are being built, we keep the pond plugged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11306)|
| 3:08:31| in the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11311)|
| 3:08:32| So, essentially, the only way water gets out is when you have that large storm, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11312)|
| 3:08:38| surcharges into the overflow structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11318)|
| 3:08:41| So, that construction pond is kind of acting like a retention pond because it is not releasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11321)|
| 3:08:47| water slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11327)|
| 3:08:49| And then once 70% stabilization of all the lots get completed, then we convert the pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11329)|
| 3:08:55| over into a detention pond, and that forward, it releases water slowly downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11335)|
| 3:09:02| It's an intended design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11342)|
| 3:09:03| So, it's a little confusing, and hopefully I've shed some light on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11343)|
| 3:09:09| Retention evolving to detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| So, that's, I just thought for those who are tuning in, that would be good information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11352)|
| 3:09:17| since we went down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| Madam Clerk, are there any other items on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| I believe we did add, I don't know if we even had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11362)|
| 3:09:25| No, that went on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11365)|
| 3:09:26| But Madam Clerk, what's our next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11366)|
| 3:09:29| That takes care of everything on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11369)|
| 3:09:32| Okay, I'll open it up for any announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11372)|
| 3:09:35| Commissioner Skidmaker and Daly, I see you've got your hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11375)|
| 3:09:40| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11380)|
| 3:09:41| What is the procedure if a citizen sends in an email for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11381)|
| 3:09:48| Is the commission office supposed to read those into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11388)|
| 3:09:52| We had, at the opening of the meeting, we had a place for public forum, and now at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11392)|
| 3:09:56| end of the agenda, we have a place for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11396)|
| 3:09:59| But did we not have any response on public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11399)|
| 3:10:05| We should get them all, and then I would think that as long as Drusilla is communicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11405)|
| 3:10:09| with the clerk's office, they should be recorded as part of the meeting minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11409)|
| 3:10:12| At least that's my intent on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| So, if that's not happening, then we need to make sure that all the, like, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11414)|
| 3:10:21| emails we got about some of the things tonight, that should all be registered as part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11421)|
| 3:10:25| meeting minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11425)|
| 3:10:26| At least that's my take on it, Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11426)|
| 3:10:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11430)|
| 3:10:31| And as with land use things, you know, we've done our best to give people a chance to weigh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11431)|
| 3:10:36| in on the land issues, things that we, because we've done it zoning the last meeting, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11436)|
| 3:10:40| we caught up on all those zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11444)|
| 3:10:46| Yeah, that brings me a good lead in, Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11446)|
| 3:10:49| Law Department, if you have anything to weigh in, make sure we've done everything correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11449)|
| 3:10:53| on John's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11453)|
| 3:11:00| Law Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11460)|
| 3:11:04| Mr. Law Director, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11464)|
| 3:11:15| I guess move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11475)|
| 3:11:15| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11475)|
| 3:11:16| I'm having trouble technologically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11476)|
| 3:11:20| And you asked me, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11480)|
| 3:11:24| Have we dotted our I's and crossed our T's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11484)|
| 3:11:27| And did you hear John's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11487)|
| 3:11:30| Yes, about the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11490)|
| 3:11:34| And I heard the Chairman's response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11494)|
| 3:11:36| And if they're included in the meeting minutes, then they were public record and available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11496)|
| 3:11:40| for everyone to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11500)|
| 3:11:43| We didn't establish anything beyond that in terms of your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11503)|
| 3:11:48| So under this COVID-19 and under the electronic, we've had two different public forum methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11508)|
| 3:11:58| And one is like, especially at the land use issues, the people come online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11518)|
| 3:12:04| And I think they have a, one of them had a selected group that spoke for, or selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11524)|
| 3:12:09| person that spoke for a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11529)|
| 3:12:10| And then we had some developers that spoke during, you know, the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11530)|
| 3:12:16| And then we had some developers that spoke during, you know, our zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11536)|
| 3:12:22| And the public has been able to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11542)|
| 3:12:26| I would check and make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11546)|
| 3:12:27| And I think the Chairman said that he was going to his own region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| I didn't comment one way or the other to make sure that they were included in the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11549)|
| 3:12:34| as part of the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| It'd be a policy issue whether you just want them read into the record or not, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11557)|
| 3:12:41| they're, you all are including them in the record by reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11561)|
| 3:12:46| It's up to you all how you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11566)|
| 3:12:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11568)|
| 3:12:51| Thank you, Mr. Law Director for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11571)|
| 3:12:54| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11574)|
| 3:12:56| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11576)|
| 3:12:57| I had actually a question for Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11577)|
| 3:13:01| This weekend, especially in the end of last week, and also Commissioner Jay, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11581)|
| 3:13:07| if I'm sure you have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| I've gotten an abnormally large amount of emails about a proposed development coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11589)|
| 3:13:15| to the Edwards Place subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11595)|
| 3:13:17| I didn't know if we were going to take the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11597)|
| 3:13:21| I remember all three of us went to a church, I feel like it was about a year ago, and talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11601)|
| 3:13:26| about a development that was coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| I didn't know if we were going to speak with that neighborhood or the people in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11608)|
| 3:13:33| over maybe sunshining something, but I browsed through the zoning portion and didn't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11613)|
| 3:13:40| anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11620)|
| 3:13:40| I just wanted to know if you could maybe update us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11620)|
| 3:13:42| Well, I'll update you a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11622)|
| 3:13:43| I have asked the Northeast Knox Planning Group if they would put together and let us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11623)|
| 3:13:49| know about a meeting and give us ample time to sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11629)|
| 3:13:53| We'd be glad to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11633)|
| 3:13:56| I will tell you that there is no sector plan change or zoning change being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11636)|
| 3:14:02| This property is already zoned for what this developer wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11642)|
| 3:14:06| So, this decision lies with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11646)|
| 3:14:09| So, just to follow up on that, it looked at first glance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11649)|
| 3:14:12| Is that more of a use on review type of issue that we've been copied on when it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11652)|
| 3:14:17| going to be coming before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11659)|
| 3:14:19| And sometimes, you know, residents don't know, you know, the full extent of how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11659)|
| 3:14:24| mechanisms work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11664)|
| 3:14:25| And so, obviously, the first thing they do is contact their County Commissioner, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11665)|
| 3:14:29| I've encouraged them to email the Planning Commission and to copy the commission on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11669)|
| 3:14:34| them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11674)|
| 3:14:36| So, yeah, this is really going to be a Planning Commission issue, but I think as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| commissioners, if they wanted to meet with us, we'd be more than happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11680)|
| 3:14:45| Yeah, I would echo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11685)|
| 3:14:46| If we're, if there's somebody who would like to meet and there's an invitation, then I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11686)|
| 3:14:50| accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11690)|
| 3:14:52| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11692)|
| 3:14:54| Commissioner Biggs, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11694)|
| 3:14:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11696)|
| 3:14:57| I appreciate that, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11697)|
| 3:14:58| I just wanted to, you know, just kind of make sure that they felt like they had our ear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11698)|
| 3:15:04| on this issue out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11704)|
| 3:15:05| I know we all three kind of teamed together once before on something like this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11705)|
| 3:15:09| sunshined it, so I just didn't know exactly where we were at in the process, but thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11709)|
| 3:15:14| you to both of them, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11714)|
| 3:15:15| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11715)|
| 3:15:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11717)|
| 3:15:18| Okay, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11718)|
| 3:15:20| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| Actually, I wanted to ask Commissioner Anders if and when we've thought about maybe doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11722)|
| 3:15:30| any more about charter review, and I'll let him answer, and then I just also want to wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11730)|
| 3:15:36| everybody a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11736)|
| 3:15:42| Yeah, so we, I've talked to the Election Commission and we talked, I've talked to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11742)|
| 3:15:47| Law Department a little bit about, you know, what it would take to get that back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11747)|
| 3:15:52| I don't think it would be conducive to try to bring that large of a group onto a Zoom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11752)|
| 3:15:56| meeting and try to change the charter without the public there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11756)|
| 3:15:59| I think that's, I think that's asking too much when there's other things that we probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11759)|
| 3:16:06| could do, and I don't, I don't think that, I think if you're going to change the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11766)|
| 3:16:08| the public ought to be in the room or have the opportunity to be in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11768)|
| 3:16:12| So, we're going to set up some meetings in anticipation of opening up for June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11772)|
| 3:16:18| We've got to get it August the 17th, I believe, end of business day, August 17th, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11778)|
| 3:16:24| to get it on the November ballot, and so I think we can have two or three meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11784)|
| 3:16:29| three or four meetings to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| It'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11791)|
| 3:16:32| It may be a Saturday, but we're going to try to set some of those things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11792)|
| 3:16:38| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11798)|
| 3:16:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11799)|

| 3:16:42| Any other announcements or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11802)|
| 3:16:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11805)|

| 3:16:49| Is there a motion for adjournment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11812)|

| 3:17:03| Do we not have the public hearing meeting immediately after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11823)|
| 3:17:05| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11825)|
| 3:17:06| I'm about to close this one, and then I think we've got to set up as a secondary Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11826)|
| 3:17:12| So, I'll look to the IT department, and is that, to confirm, is this public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11832)|
| 3:17:17| going to be a separate Zoom meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11837)|
| 3:17:18| That is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11838)|
| 3:17:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-200518-business?start=11840)|
