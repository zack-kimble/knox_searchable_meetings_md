| 0:02:26| I talked to item number 11-0, I should say, for four weeks, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| Briefly, I talked to Mr. King right before the meeting, and this is a development at Broadway and Jacksboro Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=151)|
| 0:02:39| that part of the deal when this council approved it a while ago, a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| was when this development was done, the developer had offered to pay for a traffic light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| and unfortunately now, for reasons we're still trying to find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| the developer's not wanting to pay for the traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| So we're going to try to see what we can find out in the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=182)|

| 0:03:23| One is the banking contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| 11-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| I'm glad you know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| That's debatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| 11-K, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| I'd like to postpone 11-K for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=211)|

| 0:06:48| I see Buddy Harrell up there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| You're welcome to come or stay seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| I know Buddy, he'd rather stay seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| Mark, just let me give you a little background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Mark is an equipment operator in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| We have a new GED program that the city is sponsoring to allow workers who have never received their GED to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=420)|
| 0:07:08| And Mark, I think, David, if I'm right, is the first person to take advantage of that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| And if I have my numbers right, Mark dropped out of high school as a junior in 1977, so 31 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| But I think his daughter had been encouraging him to go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| and so he took advantage of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| And, David, I don't know if you want to add more to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| but we would love to recognize him as the first person to take advantage of this really terrific program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Thank you, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| I just wanted to appreciate or say thanks to City Council for supporting the budget request we had last year for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| The $5,000 went towards this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| So congratulations to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=466)|
| 0:08:09| But also to get a certificate to congratulate you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| And thank you for not only for doing that, but for setting the pace for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| And hopefully a lot of other people will take up your example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| So thanks for being a great role model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=498)|
| 0:08:31| Okay, reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Just to let folks know, the reception that was hosted for the new school superintendent, Dr. Jim McIntyre, went very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=517)|
| 0:08:45| We had about 50 to 60 folks there over the course of the evening from Beaumont, Bell Morris, Fulton, and Whittle Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=525)|
| 0:08:54| I certainly understand that folks, you know, wanted to attend the services for Dean Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=534)|
| 0:09:01| I would have been there, too, except for the reception was in my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| So he was very appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| We had a good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| I appreciate those members of council who were able to fit it in to their evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Yes, I have a very special report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| But I want to say when I saw you sprinting around here like that, you've had a very active week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=560)|
| 0:09:29| We actually spent about a week ago, we spent a very cold, chilly afternoon celebrating the opening of the Third Creek Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=569)|
| 0:09:38| which was just absolutely very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| And it was particularly exciting to see kids there, grown-ups, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| Bob Wilson would wonder how I characterized him as a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| But anyway, with their bikes and with their biking gear and ready to take a ride on that wonderful greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| So if you haven't had that experience or if you just want to look at the amazing bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| you can go to the Winson Theater and look at it from the end of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| That's kind of my kind of exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| But I want to thank the mayor and the administration, Mr. King, and everyone involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| It's just great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| And then yesterday I got to see you with a tennis racket about to freeze to death, trying in that wind to loft a tennis ball or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=614)|
| 0:10:24| Are you describing my tennis playing as trying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| I thought it was very brave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| We had a very brisk wind and everybody was trying to beat the wind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| But it was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| We were at the West Hills Tennis Courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| And once again, Mr. King and his crew and the other people involved in that have just done a fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| And West Hills is very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| Mr. Anderson was there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| And we just want to thank you all for all you have done for the west part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| Now I know everybody else is going to be saying, come see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Shall I go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Well, I have another little announcement that comes from a committee on which I serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| I am on the Art in Public Places Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| And I want to just tell you a bit about that because something exciting is about to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| And I will read from the prepared document so that I don't state anything in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| Art in Public Places is a professionally juried and curated collection of large-scale outdoor sculptures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=684)|
| 0:11:32| by exceptional regional artists which are temporarily installed and exhibited throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=692)|
| 0:11:40| Art in Public Places is a partnership between the Dogwood Arts Festival and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| And it is celebrated as a featured event of the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| Wayne Trapp, a nationally exhibited and collected sculptor from North Carolina, is curator of the 2009 Art in Public Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=711)|
| 0:12:01| 2009 marks the third year of this highly successful exhibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| Over the past two years, this exhibition has graced Crouch Park and its extension with 12 notable sculptures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| sponsored by various downtown businesses and individual art supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| But very exciting news is here on the horizon for 2009 because the Dogwood Arts Festival is planning an expanded exhibition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=739)|
| 0:12:29| of 35 monumental outdoor sculptures to be temporarily installed throughout Knoxville and exhibited from April through October of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=749)|
| 0:12:39| The exhibition will not only grace Crouch Park as it has for the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| but it is now going to expand to various sites throughout and around the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| Crouch Park, Market Square, Volunteer Landing Park, and the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| Art in Public Places also plans to orchestrate a purchase award program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| where acquired artworks will be presented to the city of Knoxville's permanent collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| The goal for 2010 Art in Public Places for the Dogwood Arts Festival 50th anniversary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=786)|
| 0:13:14| is 50 important large-scale outdoor sculptures throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| And the mayor, I think, has written to the Dogwood Arts Festival with his approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| and exclamation of celebration about their extensive plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| And I think we have with us a couple of very important guests from the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| That would be Lisa Duncan and Linda Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| And I'd like to recognize you all if you'll just stand quickly at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| And they're right here before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| And we're very...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| I think that would conclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| And, Lisa, I don't know that we've gotten to formally welcome you to your new role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| but as a city we're very glad you're there and look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Yeah, two quick personal things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| One, I have a head call tonight, so if after the meeting you want to be friendly with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| and I'm seeming standoffish, it's actually because I do like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| So, if I hug you, that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Everybody who's disappointed by that not getting a Becker hug right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| Second, and also Mr. Brown is being particularly thankful at being next to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=860)|
| 0:14:29| Second, I just want to say that sometime probably right after Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| I'm actually going to be joining the 21st Century and disconnecting my home phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| So, just to be clear publicly, now the phone number for me is 3870752.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| I will be wireless now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| It's so cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| I'm very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Joe, is that your lighter next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| First of all, this Thursday, two days from today, at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| at the South Knoxville Elementary School cafeteria, as part of the South Waterfront process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| Mr. Hill, thanks to much of his hard work, we're having a design open house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| for the final Lincoln Landing River Road design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| This is an important part of the movement forward of the South Waterfront development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| a major infrastructure project that the city is putting together with the design consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| Vaughn and Milton and their team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| So, we're going to have an open house, again, 6 p.m. Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| at the South Knoxville Elementary School in the cafeteria on Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| So, I hope that anyone who's interested in that will come by and see what's been designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| I think you'll find it exciting in the way we're moving forward there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| The other thing is also a design effort related to our near downtown focus area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=950)|
| 0:15:58| This is in Councilman Frost's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| He asked me to go ahead and mention it since I had more details, and he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| Planapalooza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| It's this Friday, November 21st at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| The Downtown North Association is sponsoring it, working with the UT College of Architecture and Mark Schimente.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| At 6 p.m. on Friday, they'll have an open house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| And then on Saturday, the 22nd, this Saturday, starting at 10 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| there's a workshop, so just wanted to let everybody know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| A lot of good things happening in our near downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| and this is an effort to help ensure that we have a robust and exciting planning and design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=994)|
| 0:16:42| I encourage anybody that's interested to come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Joe, the time on that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| 6 p.m. on Friday and 10 p.m. on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| 10 a.m., I bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| 10 a.m., I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I didn't say that it's in the old White Stores building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| My understanding is it's one of the buildings that Mr. Hsu has remodeled across from the Time Warped Tea Room on Central Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1019)|
| 0:17:08| just up from Anderson Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1031)|

| 0:18:12| I'd love to comment real briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Mrs. Burchett is here, as well as son Tim and his new bride Allison and daughter Joyce and grandson Billy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| I think I've got all the fam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Did I get everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| And we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| I know several of us got to be at the memorial service last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| and Tim and Joyce and Billy all spoke very eloquently about their father and grandfather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| and everything that he meant to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| So we are very grateful for that and grateful also that you took the time to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| I think it means a lot to council that you would show up to help us recognize Dean Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| I just wanted to say I couldn't begin to talk about Dean Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| but I'm sure as we all ran for office you received a little political advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| and if you were at the University of Tennessee you probably got a second chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| and saw what a really big heart he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| and what an optimistic, positive person he was who really was thoughtful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| and had a great sense of humor, and we'll miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Councilman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Well, it's just kind of like talking about my other dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| but the memories will never fade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| And Joyce and Tim and, well, little Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| I have to say little Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| It was Timmy and little Joyce and little Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| They grew up with my children, and we grew up just a couple blocks apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| And I love you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| I loved your dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| He was Brother Burchett to me, and I was always Sister Pelow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| and that was a special relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| But what he has left as his legacy in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| is just something that no one else will leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| He was an extraordinary individual, an extraordinary person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| who just extended his love and his generosity to so many of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| and we appreciate you sharing him with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| Everyone who knows Dean Burchett knows that he had the things that meant the most to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| were his faith, his family, and his military career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| And so it was a little poignant that Memorial Service was on Veterans Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| and that it was bittersweet Saturday when we celebrated the opening of the new Veterans Monument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| I know almost all the council was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| but I don't think Senator Burchett would be embarrassed to say that it was when they started singing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| or playing the Marine hymn that it brought a little choke to a lot of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| So thank you very much for coming tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| and know how much we appreciate your husband, father, and grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| He meant a lot to all of us in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1250)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1263)|
| 0:21:15| That being said, we now have to vote on the aforementioned item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1275)|

| 0:28:33| Before we say that, we should talk about what we're going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Because at some level, my sense is there's still negotiations going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| so I would say we should postpone a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| But I know there are people here who have things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| I know there's some options being discussed about going over with council what the options for what's being discussed are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1728)|

| 0:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Councilman Frost or Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| I was just going to jump in and say that since we adhere to the Sunshine Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| I have no idea what you're talking about in terms of ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| So before I make a decision to postpone, I would like to be briefed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| and maybe Councilman Frost is going to do that because I'm in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1752)|

| 0:29:31| And proposals were put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1771)|

| 0:29:37| and contemplate them and run them by city engineering because city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| I forgot city engineering was also at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| And the neighborhood has come up with proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| The neighborhood tweaked the proposal that city engineering said it needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| to be massaged some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1791)|

| 0:29:56| They have a landscape architect who's very nice, very friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| and lending his time to help out to see if there can be a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| And late today, I mean, like a little before five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| I sent another revised proposal that the neighborhood is willing to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| But, you know, Kroger's has to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| The city has to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| The city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| So I kind of agree with what Councilman Becker was just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| that we've got discussions going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| And I think they were, it sounds like they were very fruitful last Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| So maybe those discussions need to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| City engineering needs to have the opportunity to look at what was being proposed late today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| and maybe if there are any revisions to that that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| So I almost, I mean, I kind of agree that it might be premature to go much further tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1851)|
| 0:31:00| when we've got something that just got passed along to city engineering a little before five o'clock today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Councilman Frost, I wonder, procedurally I know a lot of times we hear from people before a motion is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| I don't know that we're locked into that in terms of our procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| But I wonder if there seems to be an intent to postpone that perhaps it might be helpful for someone to make that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1882)|
| 0:31:31| and then the discussion and the input really focus on that proposed postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| Well, other folks have their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| So I'd like to see what they have to say before we make any sort of motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I believe Mr. Becker's light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Since he's already spoken, I'll go ahead and go to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| He's deferring, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| I'm not sure that's always a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| No, I was just going to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| This certainly caught me by surprise, and also Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| I see a number of people here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| I would really like to hear from the neighborhood, from perhaps some, I think, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| there were kind of three groups that had some interest in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| and I'd like to hear their comments on a proposal and what that would mean to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| if that would seem to be something that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| And then I would very much like to hear from Mr. King in regard to what has been put before him that we're not aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1948)|
| 0:32:37| So I don't care in what order we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| So maybe Mr. King would like to comment first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| and then I'd like to hear from the three before we vote on a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| Councilman Becker, do you want to add something now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| Actually, in a lot of ways, I'm scared to admit this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| but I agree with Ms. Pelow about how we should proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| I think what I want to be, my sense is that there's still negotiations going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| so I think there are things we can talk about here, get a sense of what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| but I don't want this, I don't feel like we want to aim towards a yes or no vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| because there's still negotiations going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| So I'd almost like to say let's have some discussions and then move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| I think there are actually more than three sides on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| I think there are four or five, but there are numbers of people involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Let me do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| I think Councilman Becker and Councilman Pelow are correct that maybe we're not moving towards a yes-no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| How would folks feel that maybe we just do a brief suspension of the rules for people to talk about what the current proposals are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2019)|
| 0:33:49| so we don't need to get into three in favor, three against, one rebuttal for two minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2029)|
| 0:33:57| and people can just talk about the Kroger's proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| and people can talk about the neighborhood, what the neighborhood has put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| How does that sound to people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Go ahead, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Go ahead, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Let me hear what you've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| I didn't know about the latest proposal from Gibbs Drive, so that's news to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| So I don't know how to take that into account with all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| But I do think we've done, in terms of we being engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| have done some work on kind of what the Gibbs Drive proposal from two or three days ago was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| So if it's something close to that, we might be able to give you some feedback in terms of cost and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| I think Kroger can maybe speak to the idea that Marilyn had at two weeks ago's meeting about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| why can't you move your driveway to the south, and I think it would be good to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| And then I would think to follow your ideas of suspending the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| and maybe let somebody present from Gibbs Drive what's the latest idea, if they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| I don't know if they figured out how to get it on the screens or if they can do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| I saw Chris Kirby from Kroger's or from Wilbur Smith for Kroger's already had his thing ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| so it might be easier to talk about his since his equipment's already plugged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| Let me just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| I'm not sure who has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Can somebody from Gibbs Drive talk to the latest proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| Is there a way to do that so you can just sort of give counsel an idea of what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| And is there a – Paul, I'm looking at you because I don't know who else to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| I'd rather you look at anyone but me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| I just saw George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| What I would suggest or would like to see is if there are three or four plans out there that are being considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| and the consensus is that from the representative of the district and from Kroger's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| and the neighborhood representatives that are here, the consensus is they want to talk some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| and the administration is along with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| then I would much rather hear what are the three or four proposals that are on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| so I can at least get an idea of what those are and not hopefully go into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| with all due respect to Councilman Frost, a wide open, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| let's hear from everybody about what you think about those plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| because that almost sounds like we're in workshop mode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| and we'll be here for two hours kind of just bouncing something around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| and then we're going to come back in two weeks or four weeks and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| So if the consensus is we want a little more time to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| and all parties, the four parties that are involved here, city, neighborhood, Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| and representatives are agreeing with that, then I would just rather hear what the plans are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| know that everybody is considering those, and then let them go back and consider those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| as opposed to now hearing what people think about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| because we're going to do that again in four weeks or two weeks from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| and if we suspend the rules and open it as a wide open, I see just a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| and we'll be here for a couple of hours and we're not having progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| I think that's well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| May I just propose this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Why don't we, if somebody can come describe kind of the latest idea from Gibbs Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| because we have some response, we have some cost figures on the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| We don't know what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| If somebody could come give us that briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| We're not looking for arguments, pros and cons about the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Just what's the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| And then we might get Kroger to summarize their thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| and then I'm going to let Steve King comment on any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| Council, is everybody okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Who's going to come first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Hello, this is George Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| George, if you could put your address, too, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| George Scott, 3045 Gibbs Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| I would just, I'm a layman here, guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| but I would suggest that we go ahead with our timed presentations that we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| and get them out pretty quick and you'll see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| We don't need necessarily to vote tonight, but at least it will bind everything up in a bundle for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| It would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| We can do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| It's council's prerogative and we'll go to whatever they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| I think there is some benefit in having the Gibbs Drive folks at least somebody present up front the new idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2277)|
| 0:38:05| And I don't, I think that to me, unless council just waves me off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| I think there's, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| And I think that's fine if there's one person who wants to say, here's the Gibbs idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| and then Kirk would say, here's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| We won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| If we get three on each side and then a rebuttal on each side and then we start talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| We're here tonight to help work out something and we're not going to cut somebody off because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| but we are going to force you into just talking about what we need to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| So if we could do that, then we'll go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Paul, if you'll, I'm sorry to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| but the best you can, if you could describe what the new idea is, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2312)|
| 0:38:40| Paul, I need your name and address, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Paul Dickinson, 3013 Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| We did not want to recap everything again and we'll try to make this short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2329)|
| 0:38:57| Last, let's see if I can get my dates right, last Thursday, maybe the 16th, I don't remember the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2337)|
| 0:39:08| We met with Kroger and Mr. King and a representative of the Fountain City business community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2348)|
| 0:39:22| and we hashed out some ideas, ideas that came from Ms. Pilo two weeks ago that were great ideas about signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2362)|
| 0:39:30| and a boulevard, suggestions from Ms. Roddy about the island traffic calming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2370)|
| 0:39:41| and that very forceful suggestion from Mr. Brown that we fix this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| And so that was on a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| The following Thursday we met, Monday the 10th, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2394)|
| 0:40:07| And back one more, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| What about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Well, okay, I guess we'll start here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| Okay, you want to go back one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| This was Kroger's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| I will mention that their first proposal was an island and then simply a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2426)|
| 0:40:37| I believe it was just a concrete strip down the middle as a boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2437)|
| 0:40:45| And then there was this proposal with a sign in front and then street trees on the boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2445)|
| 0:40:57| As you can see, Kroger did nothing to change their alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| They still want their entrance where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2464)|
| 0:41:11| And since October the 7th, which I think was the first time we met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| they haven't budged on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| In fact, they haven't given much of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| They haven't changed their plans whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| What they continue to do is ask us to change our street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| to change our access to our homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| and to have us make all the concessions, and they proposed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2498)|
| 0:41:48| No offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Could you go to the sign next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| This was the sign they proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| Nothing against that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| It's, I'm sure, very attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| but one of the things we asked for was something that was a little more in keeping with the style of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2522)|
| 0:42:16| But I'm sure that is negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| I'm sure we can change signage without price becoming an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2538)|
| 0:42:28| Again, Kroger simply keeps asking us to give, give, give, and they're giving nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| And, in fact, Mr. Giacca mentioned on Friday the 14th, yesterday the 17th, and today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2555)|
| 0:42:45| that Kroger is not willing to pay for any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| They say they're over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Well, you know, their budget is $16 million on one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| What do you suppose our budget is, Gibbs Drive, on our 54 houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| I broke my glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| That's going to break my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| You know, they say they can't give anything, but they're asking us to give, give, give, give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2585)|
| 0:43:15| And I'm sorry, but that kind of makes us a little hot, and we're not crazy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2595)|
| 0:43:25| Now, are we willing to compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| We've talked and talked and talked about compromising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| And where is Aaron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| I guess I'll just do this since apparently we do not have it on the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2616)|
| 0:43:48| This is the new proposal, and if it could be passed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| Here's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| And this is the revision on what's the last slide up there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| This is the revision on the proposal that was made Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2640)|
| 0:44:14| Okay, this is the proposal that was made, I believe it was Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| I'm sorry, I can't remember the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| We show this to Mr. King, and he said, I don't want to put words into his mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| so it's real pretty, but there's too much traffic calming there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| And that is that if there are two, three, four cars that are trying to get into Gibbs from Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2672)|
| 0:44:40| somebody's going to have their rear end stuck out into Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| Sorry, trying to get onto Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| someone's going to have the rear end of their car stuck out onto Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| and it's probably going to get hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| So the new proposal that's being passed around makes that curve much more gentle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2693)|
| 0:45:02| and easier for cars to get onto Gibbs from Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2702)|
| 0:45:12| So that is our new proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Sorry, everybody else, you can't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| But it's the same plan, simply making it a gentler curve to get onto our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2716)|
| 0:45:29| So it is sort of our understanding that Kroger has offered a lowball bid, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2729)|
| 0:45:51| In fact, one of their islands, they showed the sign, Blue Fescue, which is a very cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2751)|
| 0:46:02| Hey, Paul, I think what we need now is just speaking to that one proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| And I'm going to let you argue all you want later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| but for now I think what council wants is just to understand what that proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| Fine, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| We're going to give you a lot of chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| I just want to keep us on track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| Maybe the next thing would be, I guess, Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| if you want to get up and give us just a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| You were asked to say, can you move your driveway to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| and can you explain to us why you won't do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| Good evening, Mayor, members of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| My name is Tim McNamara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| I live at 2185 River Cliff Drive in Roswell, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| Since the last council meeting on November 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| we did meet with the neighbors on Monday, November 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| We had a very productive meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| We had the leaders of Gibbs Drive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| We had Stephen King there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| We had Councilman Becker there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| We had some very good conversation during that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| Everyone had a chance to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| We had a lot of good ideas that were shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| As we understood it going into that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| and based on the last council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| and all the discussions that we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| the neighbors on Gibbs Drive have been concerned about cut-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| So the first thing that we did design was just a write-in, write-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| to help alleviate their concern for cut-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| Now, in the meeting on Monday, November 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| when we talked about how much cut-through traffic exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| I'm trying to keep everybody focused here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I guess what we need to know right now is why you all won't consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| moving your driveway to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Because we need the drive lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| We need the access point lined up with the main drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| so we can get cars off of Broadway as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| With 45,000 cars on Broadway daily, we need to be able to get cars off Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| turn into our access point and be able to pull all the way into our center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| not where there's conflicting movements, whether to turn right or to turn left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| We want to get the cars off Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| I think the main thing we need to know from Kroger is why that won't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| or are there questions to why that won't work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| Can you just explain that a little more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| Because it seems like you can change the striping in a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| and you can have cars going lots of different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| To say we've got a big flat field here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| and if the entrance is at one place as opposed to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| things are going to get jammed up doesn't quite make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Well, we talked about it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| We'll be happy to talk about it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Chris, can you help me on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Do you happen to have that slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2941)|
| 0:49:25| Chris, do you have the slide that shows the access point coming in north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| and then the access point coming in south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| where the access point kind of leads our customers directly into the parking field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2973)|
| 0:49:42| I would suggest going back just to the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| This site plan for our proposed 80,000 square foot Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| shows the main drive right out in front of our store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| And again, the goal here is to get customers that are utilizing this access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| to be able to get off of Broadway as quickly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| and pull into the center towards the front of the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| If you go further south of this access point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| you can see you're interfering with the parking field that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| We're already under parked on this center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| and you'll see where people will come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| and they'll have to make a decision to go left or right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| We think most of the people will try to go right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| so then again you could have an issue there with further conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| where you may have people backing up into Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| This is a pretty typical standard design for any retailer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| to want to have their access point line up with their main drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| There's nothing, this isn't rocket science, this is pretty easy stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| But Mr. McNamara, in one of your variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| Kroger's asked for a reduction in parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| We didn't ask for a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| We asked for a variance for less parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| because that's all the parking that we could lay out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| We took what Target had and we did a new striping plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| to be able to pick up some additional spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| You know, MPC asked us to try to save as many trees as we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| and that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| We saved the majority of the trees that are on this property and still came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| We changed the parking from angled parking to 90 degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| to make it more customer friendly and to add additional spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| Any other questions for Kroger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| specifically on the issue of why they don't feel like they can move that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| Okay, we'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Can I speak to the design that we came up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| and talk a little bit more about our meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| I think let's hold that because I asked Paul to hold their philosophy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| as well as how they got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| We're going to let you speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| I'm just trying to work through the basic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| unless council weighs me off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| We will let you express that, but I asked Paul to hold his thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| so I think it's fair to hold that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| We will come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Steve, if you'd maybe take over now at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| and I'm going to let council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| What questions do you have for our engineering department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Well, I also would like him, Steve King that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| to comment on what Kroger's has shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| You can ask Steve about what Kroger's has shown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| what the neighborhood's plans cost would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| I mean, Steve's here to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| So whatever you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| I guess I'll start out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| And you want questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| You just don't want to sort of talk in general to the three proposals, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| Whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Well, let me make this in the phrase of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| Could you give your opinion about the three different proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| the rebuilding Gibbs Drive, the island in Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| and the relocating the Kroger entrance further to the south?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| Just from a traffic engineer, one, what are the impacts on Broadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| But more importantly, I think everybody's being honest in what they're saying about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| and how these things and how they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| But I have a great deal of respect for your abilities as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| and kind of want to hear your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Well, the option of Kroger moving their driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| as far as the traffic operation on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| I think that could be made to work from Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| but I think that it would cost the parking lot several spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| There's probably a way to do that to allow the smooth entry and exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| but I haven't looked at the details of how many parking spaces they would lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| And as you heard Mr. McNamara say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| that they already had to get a variance because they could provide less spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| than they would on a typical center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| But from strictly an engineering standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| with coming in and out of the store and the safety on Broadway, it could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| The real question there is the decrease in parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| And the other two, the island and the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| Well, if it's okay, I can talk about the one that's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| That was pretty much the result of the meeting that was held on Monday the 10th that I attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3266)|
| 0:54:35| And I think it came from the last city council meeting where there was some indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| that the neighborhood, just based on some nodding of heads in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| might be willing to accept a limitation on their access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| And I can't remember whether that came up in council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| And my understanding had always been that the neighborhood was not willing to restrict their access to ride in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| ride out, so when we had some degree of indication that that might be a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| Kroger went back and came up with this design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| And it was presented to the group or a small number of the group on Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| And this does restrict the access to ride in, ride out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| It has a small median cut to allow for the driveway that's near the Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3325)|
| 0:55:34| And it provides a boulevard entrance to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| And I think Kroger, on their own, made a suggestion about the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| The sign could be a variety of things, whatever the neighborhood felt like would fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| But it does accomplish the eliminates the potential for the cut through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| Even at the meeting we talked about if there was ever to be pressure upon the city for a traffic signal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3358)|
| 0:56:06| the traffic signal could be installed and the ride in, ride out stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| thereby not allowing any through traffic from the Kroger side to the Yip side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| And go back to the say that again, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| If beyond the let's just say there was several terrible accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| and there became pressure upon the city and the state to install a traffic signal there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| then council would have to approve it, TDOT would have to approve it, and it had to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| If it were to be installed there, it could operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| And with the Gibbs Drive Island there that would allow right turns in and right turns out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| you still would not be able to go from Kroger straight across even if it's signalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| And that was and has been and still is, I think, one of the neighborhoods concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| This design does fall short of what I think we left the council meeting two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3419)|
| 0:57:07| where the Gibbs Drive people said they would entertain any compromise as long as the drives were not lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3427)|
| 0:57:16| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Well, I don't know how to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| I'll ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Is this similar to the proposal that I put forth at the last council meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Help me to understand the little section there that is right at the edge of Gibbs Drive and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3459)|
| 0:57:48| That's a little separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| It appears to be a little separate permanent median or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| And then there is the elongated median there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| Help me to understand why there are two sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Well, we needed to allow access to that driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| I think it's been referred to as the Whaley House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| So that is in order to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Otherwise that property owner would have to go to the end of the median and make a U-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| I'm familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| I just had not envisioned seeing a separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| Let me ask one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| I guess the other question that I think council had asked or some people on council had asked us to prepare was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| and I know the latest plan that Paul brought up is slightly different than what's shown in terms of the turn radius, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| But what is your best professional estimate of what the old Gibbs Drive plan from two or three days ago would cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3529)|
| 0:58:58| not including land because we don't know that we can get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| Well, although I had not seen the plan that Councilman Frost emailed me late today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| I had talked with Gary Menendez and gave him my thoughts on the horizontal alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3546)|
| 0:59:13| meaning the curves in the one that's on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| And I was able to estimate the cost based on my conversation with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| because really what it does is it just makes a longer street when you straighten out some of the curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| And I feel like that will cost approximately $200,000 in addition to the property purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3567)|
| 0:59:37| And, excuse me, but would you or are you prepared to comment on the cost of the plan that was presented just before this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| That one is approximately $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| Just for the record, what do we call this plan here, the straight, the boulevard, the $50,000 plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| We call it, I call it the Barbara Pelow plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| The other plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| I don't know if she wants to claim it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| On the Whaley property, are they going to give it to us, Mrs. Whaley or whoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| Well, actually, it wouldn't be her property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| It would be the property across the street, and I don't know who the owner of that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| But, no, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| That picture is on someone's private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Joe Whaley's driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| We've got a big issue there with someone's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| Joe Whaley's driveway is on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| He would actually be getting land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| But the other property is not our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| I've had a sign on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Anyway, so now on the $50,000 plan, are we willing, would that be something we'd want to discuss in terms of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3643)|
| 1:00:55| absorbing that cost in return for this new investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| I mean, are we, because Paul was talking earlier that he can't afford to get his glasses fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| so obviously the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Yeah, no, I don't think there's any assumption that the neighborhood would pay anything, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| He said Kroger wasn't interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| I think for purposes of this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| council should assume no matter what the cost is that the city is paying it, no matter what the cost is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| whether it's the $50,000 plan or the $200,000 plus land plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| First blush, how do you feel about that, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Well, I think it's important at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| I'll be glad to restore my thoughts, but I think it's important to let council finish the process here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| and I'll be glad to when council is ready for me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Do we have an estimate as to how much additional land would have to be purchased on option B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3701)|
| 1:01:49| which is the $200,000 expansion of the boulevard to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| how much of the property we have to purchase from the next person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| I'm not sure whether there's two lots there, and the first lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| I'm not sure if there would be enough of that lot left for it to be a buildable site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| There may be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| The second lot, there would be less that would be needed from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| And am I to assume with Plan B, there is no additional signage, you know, the $200,000 plus plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| there's no signage involved there at all, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| That's just a realignment of the road, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| Did your $200,000 assume a cost of a sign or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| Yes, it did assume a cost of a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| There's a sign, it's called a historic Gibbs drive marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| There's no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Is it the same size and make as the one that's in the pillow plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| Mr. Menendez, on his drawing, says stone to match nearby columns and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| That's the only detail I have on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| And I heard earlier that this plan would be, we're to assume that this is going to be city expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| I think you should assume for this discussion that both, right now, it sounds like the only person at the table is us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3789)|
| 1:03:16| Well, Rob Frost is at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| I don't know about the rest of the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| but I feel like I know we said at the beginning of this discussion that we were possibly looking at a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| so folks could go back and talk about it some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| And in the interest of everyone's time, I feel like I've heard all I need to know about the various options that are on the table at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3813)|
| 1:03:40| And rather than prolonging the discussion, I'd like to go back and have folks talk some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| It sounds like, you know, there could be some middle ground of these two plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| I know Paul started to make some comments about the pillow plan having minimal landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| and it would seem that perhaps that plan or plan A, whatever we want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| could be enhanced a little bit decoratively in terms of its look relative to the fully fleshed out plan that we see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3839)|
| 1:04:08| But it doesn't sound like we're at the juncture to make a decision on this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| so I don't know whether Mr. Becker wants to make his original motion to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| but I, for one, have heard the bare bones outline and am ready to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| I'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| Well, if there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| I don't want to cut off discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| If anybody else wants to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| I'll make a motion if nobody has anything else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| Both Councilman Arati and Councilman Becker are willing to postpone the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| If anybody would like to make a comment prior to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| I think the clear intent of at least what I hear on the floor from these two is that they would prefer to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3885)|
| 1:04:52| to see if we can push it one step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| But I think they'll defer to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| I'm in agreement with Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| I just don't know who's going to move their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| I mean, you know, in order to have a change of the complexion of this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| I need to have the sense that one of these parties, or two of these parties at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| are going to be able to come to some other conclusion than just settled on what's been presented tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3919)|
| 1:05:27| And I really didn't see...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| I didn't feel any movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| Now, you know, I don't mind postponing things when I think something is going to be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| But if it's just going to, you know, escalate the frustration level, that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| Because I think ultimately, especially if there's going to be a cost to the city, you know, it's in our laps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3943)|
| 1:05:52| And so I don't know that I'm just real happy about a postponement unless someone or some of the sides there can indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3952)|
| 1:06:02| that that would be great, we feel like a lot can be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| So I guess maybe that's kind of where I am, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| I was going to say I was in agreement, actually, with Councilmember Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| I've heard enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| And I thought I heard from Councilmember Frost and at least implied from Councilmember Becker that all these discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| and these movements and variations on the theme of the plans are an indication that the parties are willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| and are kind of moving towards each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| So I thought I kind of heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| I would also say, if we're going to postpone this, and not to put some additional work on you, Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| but in addition to your estimation that you have for the cost of what we see up there, I guess option B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4000)|
| 1:06:48| I'd like to get some sort of idea when we come back of at least an estimate of what it would be to acquire the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| land to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| If the proposal is going to call for expenditure of taxpayer dollars on something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| I'd like to have a better handle on what ballpark we're going to be in if we're going to have a vote on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| besides just the $200,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| Because I would imagine on that strip, a piece of property right there would be fairly expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| And you'd have to find a willing buyer or a willing seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| And I don't know if we've got a willing seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| So someone needs to answer those two questions, too, because that may remove it off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| So I'd like to have answers to those when we come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| I will say, and Steve, I'll speak for him here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| I don't know that Steve can get you the information on what the seller would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| We will work our hardest to try to find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| And I don't want any negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| If the seller is willing to entertain some discussion is all I kind of want to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| not that we can get a solid figure from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| And also somebody to estimate, well, in that particular area, you know, we need a half an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| or we need an acre of that and an acre of that out there is valued at X, Y, or Z on the property tax rolls right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| So we're assuming we're going to have to be in that ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| If I can just get that kind of idea, and that may be a simple look at KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| and just see what the valuations are out there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| so that I can get an idea besides knowing that that's an amorphous figure right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| and it's moving every time somebody talks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Yeah, I just wanted to briefly address Ms. Pilo's concern about, you know, is there a possibility of movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| I was the one who made the comment two weeks ago that I didn't think there was a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| And it's still possible that there won't be one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| but I think there's been an amazing amount of hard work done on both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| an amazing amount of goodwill on both sides of people who really want to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4119)|
| 1:08:45| I think that you comment you hope it won't just raise frustration levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| Well, it will because people are frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| They want both sides to win on this, and I think both sides do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| So I think it is well worth the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| It's going to raise some blood pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| There are some people that are going to have less sleep at night because they're worrying about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| but that's part of how government works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| So I think there's a lot of goodwill in this and a lot of effort being put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| So I think it's worth postponing and letting the discussion continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Moving towards discussion of the postponement, you know, thinking about the calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| and what's coming up, I'm sure the neighborhood group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| and Kroger's would like to meet one more time, at least one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| And next week is Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| Don't get me wrong, but, you know, I don't think it's reasonable to think that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| and folks in city engineering might be taking time off next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| I'm taking time off next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| The folks at Kroger's are probably taking time off next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| I mean, you know, as much as I'd like to get this taken care of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4187)|
| 1:09:53| I'm thinking we might need a four-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| It's gone on, but, you know, people go to see their families over Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4196)|
| 1:10:04| whether they're in town or they're out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| And, you know, that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| I see Councilman Hall's got his light on, so I'll be quiet now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| Well, I would hate to see all these people going into all this negotiation for something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| say they come back and they want to do this thing up here and it's $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| I, for one, don't know that I want to put $500,000 into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| And I think probably that discussion needs to happen before they go back into any kind of negotiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4233)|
| 1:10:43| because if they're coming back in here and they're coming up with a $500,000 plan that they're expecting us to buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| I mean, to sign off on and spend all this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| because that's a whole other discussion than just them agreeing on that's what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| Actually, and I'll comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| Councilman Bailey asked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| And, Councilman Becker, I always think it's when everybody wants something to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| I always think it's smart to delay and let's don't put something to premature death or premature victory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| But I do think this, in this case, I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| I don't think there's a discussion to be had between the neighborhood and Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Quite frankly, I think it's between the neighborhood and us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Kroger has basically said, here's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| We are not willing to move our driveway to the south, and we have all the investment in this that we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| And, I mean, you could argue with them or do whatever, but I think that's what they've been pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| That's where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| We have a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| Are we going to be willing to, I don't know what those two lots are worth, $150,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| I mean, so are we going to be willing to say $350,000 for the plan that gives drive drew up versus $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4305)|
| 1:11:54| My personal feeling, and I understand their concern is, with all the protections put in there between the fact that TDOT would have to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4314)|
| 1:12:01| a council, a mayor would have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Even then, you could just get a three-sided light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| I just think the chances of that ever happening are zilch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| And I think what we can do is come up with something like you talked about to maybe re-look at how that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| what the Barbara Pelo plan looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| But I think you're kidding yourself if you're saying, you guys go back and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| I think it's us talk with the neighborhood about how much we're willing to invest in something that makes them happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| So, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| I think, you know, one of the good things, as Mr. McNamara pointed out, the discussion actually did, it was not two-sided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| It was not gives drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| And city engineering was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| You know, other council people and other Fountain City folks were invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| But I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| It is a bigger discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| I think it's worth saying we're going to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| And I think it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| I think, you know, Steve King is going to lose some sleep over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| And that's, you know, probably a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| But it's worth, I don't, I guess I will say, I'd almost rather say two weeks and see where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| Because I think this has gone on a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| And at some level, while there are things to talk about, I think it's time to buckle down and have some hard discussions and do them quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4388)|
| 1:13:18| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| I mean, this is not a smart luck question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| Who should those quick discussions be between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| I mean, I think gives drive should be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| I think Kroger should be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| I think Fountain City Town Hall should be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| I think city engineering should be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| I was at the table for one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| I'm going to be going a bunch over the holidays as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| But I think council can add a lot to those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| So, you know, I think that the more folks at the table in a good discussion, the better ideas we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4423)|
| 1:13:51| I think you see that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| I think I agree with Councilman Hall and the mayor that probably what we're getting down to is a discussion of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| and our willingness to commit taxpayer funds from across the city to this project at Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| But if that is the bottom line, then I think that we do need to have as accurate a proposal as we can muster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4448)|
| 1:14:17| And, you know, just to throw out, well, Plan B is half a million probably isn't fair to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| But to also say that Plan A is 50 may not be fair either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| You know, if the landscaping needs to be done, I mean, we really need to price it accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| Because in my mind, there's a big difference between 50 and 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| That's 50 percent more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| And, again, if I'm obligating taxpayer funds from across the city, I need to know what I'm in for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4475)|
| 1:14:41| So I guess that's what I would look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| And I don't even know in my mind if Kroger needs to be part of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| I mean, to me that sounds like Gibbs Drive and city engineering and, you know, horticulture or some design people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| And let's get some really concrete options on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| I think go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| I'm sorry, Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Well, I was just going to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| I don't know if it would be of you, Mayor Haslam or Mr. King, but can two weeks bring us back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4502)|
| 1:15:11| I think the one thing we cannot answer, I shouldn't say, we don't know if we can answer by then is what it will cost us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| acquire that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| And I don't think there's anybody here that can realistically speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| That's the one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| So we can maybe look at another plan and come back with a hard cost of this is exactly what the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| whatever we call the $50,000, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| Here's exactly what the $50,000 plan will cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| We can hone that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| The other, I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| I mean, I don't know about the willingness of the seller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| I don't know anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| So, Councilman Woodhull, I know there's some people in the audience that are dying to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| But let me kind of keep it on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| The answer to your question is that Gibbs Drive needs to talk to each other about a very good option, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4552)|
| 1:16:00| that's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| They've done good work at articulating their point of view that the alignment does send cut-through traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4561)|
| 1:16:12| I think, into their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| And the PILO plan, I think, addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| So, I think two weeks is worthwhile for them to talk to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| And I'm talking out loud, and Ms. Poplin or Mr. Swanson can swap my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| I think one of the things that would help, quite frankly, particularly for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| is if we had some sense of where council is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| And I don't know how you'd, you might say, but if you said, I mean, Chris, you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| well, I think that's a pretty good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| It might need some refinement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| And I don't want to pin anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| Maybe you don't want to say that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Let's just turn it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| But right now we're in a situation where we can bring you back two options refined the best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4606)|
| 1:16:54| But the more input you can give us in terms of, and give the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| in terms of what you'd like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| And you don't have to necessarily do that tonight, but I think the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| So, Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| I'll step out on the limb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| The reason I asked the question earlier about getting at least some more estimation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| or guesstimation on total cost here is because I have some of the same questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| that I think I hear Councilman Hall and Councilmember Roddy have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| And quite frankly, the more expensive the proposition of expenditure of taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| on this one particular realignment here, the more I am apt to not vote for something of that nature, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4648)|
| 1:17:35| If you want to hear from me, nobody else may need to get out on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| But, you know, that's why I want to hear what the dollars are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| You know, we used to talk about $200,000 to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| You're talking $0.08 to $0.10, you know, on the tax rate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| So you're talking about some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| So if you want a feel from at least one Councilmember, you know, the more it's going to cost us to do, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4671)|
| 1:18:00| Plan B, which is a very good-looking plan, but if all it's going to be is city taxpayer dollars put into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4680)|
| 1:18:08| I've got an issue with, you know, what that total cost would be and also setting that type of a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| as opposed to the Plan A, which we're calling the PILO plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| which is not as large an expenditure as it seems to be and the kind of thing that maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| in the scheme of traffic calming rationale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| maybe something that would be more palatable to me about the large expenditure of funds I'd have some concerns with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4708)|
| 1:18:38| I saw both St. Tagoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Councilman Haldeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| Well, to get an idea of how I feel about it, I'd like to ask Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| why do we need a boulevard there when we're just really wanting to make it a right in and right out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4726)|
| 1:18:55| Well, I think that came from a suggestion at Council last time as an attempt to make a neighborhood entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4735)|
| 1:19:04| And oftentimes you see in old and new neighborhoods that I think there's one at Cumberland Estates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4744)|
| 1:19:13| there's a boulevard entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| It's a pretty common entrance to a neighborhood, and that's what we tried to create here in response to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4754)|
| 1:19:21| I'll take that because that was partly me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| What I was trying to do, and Ms. PILO was talking to that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| is convey a sense of permanence there that nobody, I mean, it's like I used the example last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| nobody's going to think about coming and wiping out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| the Cherokee Boulevard entrance there because of what's there and the way it looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| And I think the more we can create that sense of permanence, the less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| what we're all worried is about 50 years from now, some mayor and council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| I can't imagine happening, but decide and let them cut through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| I don't think that'll ever happen, but we're trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| That was that, and so the extra cost was, that was quite frankly me pushing that just to give that look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| Well, excuse me, but that was my intent, Councilman Haldeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| Well, I just felt like, you know, I think there is a sense, and excuse me, Joe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| but let me just comment because I just had the feeling that everyone feels as if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| I think it's been said tonight, we just keep giving and giving and nobody else gives anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| Well, I do think that this is a significant neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| I do think the historic status of the neighborhood will be better preserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4820)|
| 1:20:27| if it has an attractive entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| And in my trips out there to try to deal with this issue, I just felt, well, gosh, that would be a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4829)|
| 1:20:37| And then to have it permanent, as the mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| where it is not going to be something that will just easily be changed overnight is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| So I was hoping that this would be an opportunity for Gibbs Drive to have some real significance in the Fountain City community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4846)|
| 1:20:55| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Yeah, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| In looking at this plan up here, I think that first, Councilman Becker called it a teadrop or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| addresses the Gibbs Drive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| And then the boulevard is, I think, an add-on and enhances the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| And in terms of the cost, which I asked that earlier, I think that if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| in terms of this Kroger development, that your return on something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| a new Kroger, a new development, you get your money back in not very long a time at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| So I think from a city standpoint, that's not a bad investment if you're looking at $40,000 or $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| if you went the whole pilo plan or the boulevard plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| And I think this is a great offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| And I don't think that there's a loser in this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| I think it's a win-win and we accomplish our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| There's no cut-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| As you said, Mayor, down through the years, I don't think you'll ever see any of this going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4913)|
| 1:22:00| So, you know, I'm in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| I'd just like, as Councilman Roddy said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| if we're going to commit city tax dollars from around the city, I'd like to know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| But I do think if it's in that $50,000 or less category, that it's a good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| Move to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| There's a motion and a second to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| All those in favor of postponing for two weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| I know a lot of you came tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| Some of you drove from Atlanta, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| I know that you're not, some folks aren't happy about having to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| I think what you see, though, as a council, it's really working hard to work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| And I promise we're going to keep trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| I know everybody would like to see something different happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| I know also there are a lot of you tonight who are dying to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| And I saw hands of, like, questions about stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| I think there was kind of this, we kind of set the ground rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| I thought it was important to stick to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Obviously, you know, these council folks are very approachable and available by e-mail and every other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4982)|
| 1:23:10| Becker just gave the whole world his cell phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| I think that, you know, if you have input into some questions that were brought up tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| I welcome you to bring those to the administration, engineering, and the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| 11J is a resolution requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| and encouraging the executive director and the professional staff at the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| to study, evaluate, and analyze the feasibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| and potential for adopting a comprehensive sidewalk ordinance for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| Requested by Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| Mr. Mayor, I've, you know, we've been working on this a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| And I've tried to, you know, to work with the administration on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| And I know when you and I talked about this over a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| we said that the administration had some ideas on how to move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| We had a council workshop on it and a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| And we referred this to the Transportation and Mobility Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| and the city engineering for some ideas on an administration proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| And I've been waiting on that process to try and go along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| And what I heard for about the last six weeks is that the administration was going to be handing out a proposal tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| not something we vote on, not something that's finished that we need to move forward on, still some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| And I got lots of folks in the neighborhoods telling me that the administration is just jerking me around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5072)|
| 1:24:39| And I guess I want to ask, does the administration have something to hand out or have you been jerking me around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| The answer to the second one is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| I'm going to let Dr. Lyons answer the first piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| Thank you, Mayor and Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Where we are on this is in the last few weeks, once the law was looking over, as we were, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| working on the proposal in good faith to have ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| had some questions about some of the underpinnings that might be necessary based on some case law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| and some other things that I'll let Ms. Poplin go into, if you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| such that we thought that the appropriate thing to do was to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| And we think that a good and responsible direction to go is to prepare a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| go along with the proposal that's on the agenda, the item, and prepare it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| and ask engineering and MPC to, in fact, work on a plan that would underlie the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| that we'd be working toward while law worked on straightening out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| and investigating some of the legal backdrop that they thought was essential to have a responsible ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| So that is a concern that came up in the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| We were in good faith and engineering was in good faith preparing that proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| but we just thought that with the legal questions that came up that having a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| underlie that would be the responsible way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| I keep hearing you say you're doing it in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| I don't believe that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| I mean, it's been over a year since I started serious conversations with the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| and every time something comes up, you find some reason we can't move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| And I don't understand why we can't hand something out tonight to say this is where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| I've had pieces of paper waved at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| Oh, yeah, this is what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| I've heard numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| It's five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| It's this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| And six weeks ago, I said we'd had something to vote on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| Then it was we'd had something to hand out, and now it's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| Frankly, I'm getting sick, and I'm believing that I'm getting jerked around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| And my voice is not particularly good shape, but I think council deserves better than this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| and I think personally I deserve better than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| I can assure you we're not jerking you around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| I don't know if Ms. Poplin or Mr. Swanson wants to comment on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| but I can assure you that our full intent was to do what we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| Debbie, do you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| I'd be happy to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| The engineering proposal, I've never been asked to review the neighborhood proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| The engineering proposal came to me about six weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| We started reviewing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| I started doing the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| I looked into the AG opinion that the neighborhood had asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| I have questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| I don't necessarily agree with that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| I researched the case law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| And as I shared with you several weeks ago, I did want to take some time and look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| There are some issues that could potentially cause liability to this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| and I want to make sure I give good advice on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| Charles Swanson and I have met and discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| and I believe we're in agreement on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| that we just need a little time to look into these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5255)|
| 1:27:42| It's been a year, Bill, since I told you this was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| I don't know what else to say except that we, just what Debbie just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| we just found out that it's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| It's not true at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| And we wouldn't tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| You've worked with us enough to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| If I could add, one of the basic things that I have found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| or at least come to in part of a conclusion, is that to make this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| there needs to be a master sidewalk plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| something that we can incorporate in any sort of implementation of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5290)|
| 1:28:16| So based on what is on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| maybe perhaps that could go ahead and move along to MPC so that they could work with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| on a master sidewalk plan because it appears that that will be something that would help support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| an implementation of this type of ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| And that is one thing that's missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| and that is one thing that was readily apparent upon my review of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| What's stopping us from voting on this resolution tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| Well, because what we'll do is we'll send it ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| and then the administration will come up with another problem and why we can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| Bob, I don't know how to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| It's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| I mean, we're in favor of moving this along, as Councilman Frost just suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| I don't know how to tell you any plainer than what Debbie just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| You know, you've worked with us this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| I hope you believe us that we're not making up a story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| We think we have some legal concerns for the city to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| How much longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| I'll ask for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| How much longer is this expected to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| Well, Charles and I, in our discussion, we were thinking about perhaps 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5363)|
| 1:29:33| The things that they were talking about with respect to legal issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| are relatively complex legal issues that need to be looked at thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| And I will say that in my association with this particular issue, I am aware of the frustration of Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5384)|
| 1:29:59| I'm also aware of the fact that the administration has, in fact, been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| They've been working on it in a number of different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Unfortunately, one of the directions was the engineering department was working on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| that recently gets shared with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| The engineering department really has no reason to understand some of the complexities of the legal issues associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| with what the engineering department is putting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| So then when it gets circulated to the law department, the law department says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| We need to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| And reasonably so, they need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| It's up to the law department to protect the city from potential liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| And so, you know, I think it's a reasonable thing to do to take some time to look at this complex legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5436)|
| 1:30:45| If it takes 30 to 60 days, it's worth the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| I know that the law department has a number of issues they're working on right now in a number of different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| I don't say that this issue doesn't deserve their urgent attention, and it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| And best I can tell, when I was in their office the other day, they had five lawyers working on it at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| So in my estimation, it is getting that degree of urgent attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| But the legal issues have arisen more recently and need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5472)|
| 1:31:20| And I guess that's about all I can say to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| I can 100% guarantee you there's been no effort on my part, Bill's part, anybody's part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| to slow this down either directly or subtly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| I'm just telling you 100% honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| Being the co-chair of the Transportation Mobility Committee, I can tell you that the subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| it's not the neighborhood group any longer that's working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| It's a subcommittee of the committee as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| And Donna Buckman has chaired that subcommittee, and we had a meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| And, you know, we're trying to find a way to move ahead productively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| but, you know, it puts her in a position where she just has to vent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| You know, I mean, nobody knows what's going on, and I hear about legal concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5527)|
| 1:32:15| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| I'd like to see a summary list of those issues as they've been identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| not that all of them have been identified, but I don't have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| And Councilman Becker has been working on it a lot more than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| Do you have a clue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| A paper has been waived at me a couple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| But you haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| I'm not sure that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| I think you and I sat down and had a meeting, and I discussed the legal issues with you in some detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| I don't think it's fair to say that you've had papers waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| I've had a copy of the proposal waived at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| I've seen a copy of it with lots of blanks in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Well, you've seen more than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| We've also discussed exactly what legal issues we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| And I understand the legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| I don't see why the legal issues prevent sharing a little information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| I don't understand why we can't hand something out tonight and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| this is what we're thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| I'd just like to see a list of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| I know it's going to be preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| I know, just bullet points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| these are some of the issues that we've identified so far that we think need further research, legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| I mean, I don't have any idea what those are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| I might come up with my own mind what I think some of them might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| but I'd probably be totally off base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| I don't have an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| And I don't think, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| Ms. Bugman, I think, would probably like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| She's standing there next to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| But I haven't heard from her in our meetings that she's really aware of what those issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5610)|
| 1:33:38| because I don't think they've been communicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| And maybe I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| I just feel like I'm in the dark here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| I would urge you to speak with your counsel about the reason that we haven't presented it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| Until tonight, I didn't know our counsel was involved in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| I mean, I have heard from Mr. Swanson about what the legal issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| and I don't see how those legal issues prevent sharing what we're thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| This whole idea of somehow it would be in bad faith to tell counsel something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| before we were completely sure of the legal ramifications of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| We're getting ready to argue again about MinnVilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| which has had all kinds of things go right and wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| And if we had waited until we had all the details worked out on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| we still wouldn't even be moving on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| So what it feels like is it feels like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| And, you know, I want to say I've worked with you long enough that I'll get over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| But it does feel like you're all just looking for excuses to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| Well, I don't know if either one of the attorneys wants to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| In addition, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| Because Ms. Buckman is my appointee to the Transportation and Mobility Subcommittee of Counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| I feel obligated to give her the opportunity to speak because I know she came tonight to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| With the permission of counsel, I'd like to recognize Ms. Buckman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| Go ahead, Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Donna Buckman, 2417 Ridgecrest Drive, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| With respect to the legal issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| I do remember having very early on in our work with the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| it's sitting down with some of the people from the city administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| One was from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| And what basically came out of that, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| is that when we build a sidewalk, we build in city liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| And it is actually not in the best interest of the city to have sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| because it's better for people to walk on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| because when you get hit on the road, you sue the driver of the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| You don't sue the city for not having a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| So the city's never been sued for not having a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| but the sidewalk does create a liability for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| And still, in good faith, I think that we have to decide that we want a quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5753)|
| 1:36:01| that gives us the sidewalks, that gives us the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| And it does entail liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| And I know that the lawyers go, oh, my, we don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| Donna, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| The liability is not the legal issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| That was one of the things that came up in that attorney thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| But the pedestrian plan, I do understand having a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| I'm wondering if there's a way we can use the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| They do identify potential sidewalks in our sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| at least when we were working on the Fountain City Small Area Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| Those were in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Would that not qualify, at least in some extent, in a pedestrian plan sort of sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| That's something the MPC could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| And I just wanted to add the tort liability from that standpoint is absolutely not a concern that I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| This has to do with the planning and development type liability issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5811)|
| 1:37:01| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Right now there's no motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| It sounds like we need a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| I would love to say we could move this to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| but I don't know the value of sending this to MPC when, you know, the administration just doesn't seem to be valuable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5835)|
| 1:37:25| 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| So let me make a motion to postpone for 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| I hope I can make this comment and not open up the discussion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| And I hope it doesn't, I think hopefully Councilman Becker and Mr. Bookman and Councilman Holquist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| and anybody else will understand, as I listen and feel the tension regarding this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| one other thing kind of comes back to me, and I've commented about this before with regards to issues like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| I want to just make sure on the record that I've kind of said this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| When you get involved and people invest a lot of time and energy in processes like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| the expectation level gets raised about what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| And I heard this discussion as if once we go through MPC and get the legal issues resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| and come back with this plan that all of a sudden something's going to be, bam, approved by this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| and maybe it will be, but I still just need to say on the record that I'm still not totally sold on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5908)|
| 1:38:35| once we have all these pieces together that people are arguing about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| that if it's going to be something that we're going to be able to afford or be able to do or implement immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| And I get real concerned when the discussion kind of goes like it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| and there's an implication out there that, hey, once we get these questions answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| and something comes back from MPC, we're going to implement it and take off down the road flying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| So I don't want to be interpreted that I'm at that juncture yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| And that's not for comment from anybody, but just kind of going on the record that I'm not at that juncture yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| I'm looking to see the final end product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| But I get real concerned about the raising of expectations when we invest a lot of time in these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5948)|
| 1:39:14| because there are other things that we're not even talking about yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| which are going to be funding and dollars in this very tough economic time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| And if anybody takes away from this that I'm not interested in sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| all you've got to do is look at my district and see that very early on, especially around schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| you know, I advocated for and we've gotten plenty of sidewalk work done, because I do think they're important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| But I think when you're looking at an overall comprehensive ordinance like this in plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| we're going to have to, once it comes before us, we're going to have some additional hard questions to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| And I don't want to leave the impression that I've got all those resolved in my mind right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| I think, Mr. Vice Mayor, that's part of my frustration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| because I know once we get this piece of paper that was going to be handed out tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| there are still lots of discussions to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| And that's part of my frustration on why it couldn't be handed out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| Okay, the motion is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Item L is a resolution authorizing the submission of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| Substantial Amendment to the 2008-2009 Action Plan for Housing and Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| and authorizing the mayor to execute any associated documents and certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| There's at least one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6033)|
| 1:40:40| In favor is David Hutchins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| I know there's lots of other people here interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| David, I guess you're up, unless I see something different from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| Ms. O'Hara, I think, is ready to address, obviously, your questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| But, David, if you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| I'm David Hutchins, 1204 White Tower Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| I'm a commissioner with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| We're participating in two applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| One of them is part of KCDC's revitalization of public housing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| We've been working to identify funds to allow us to begin the revitalization of the Walter P. Taylor Home site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6074)|
| 1:41:22| We identified several funding sources, such as low-income housing tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| federal home loan bank affordable housing program, and HOPE VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| However, what you need to understand is that these funding sources are competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| and that receiving these funds were not guaranteed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| so we have not been aggressive in putting the pieces into motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| because we did not want to raise expectations that we could not fulfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| The Neighborhood Stabilization Program will provide us with funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| that will allow us to begin the revitalization of Walter P. Taylor Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| This project will serve as the first phase of the Walter P. Taylor Home revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| By receiving these funds, it will help us to leverage the other funding sources that I mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| and will make our application to these funding sources more competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| The Neighborhood Stabilization Program allows us to start working on the Walter P. Taylor site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| approximately 18 months to two years earlier than we had anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| That would be the Eastport Senior Housing is what we're talking about there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6142)|
| 1:42:29| The second part of the application or second application is for the HOPE VI foreclosure program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| KCDC completed their HOPE VI project on December 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| And I'll remind you that that project, the budget for that was over five years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| and we ended up under budget on that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| This project consisted of home ownership as well as rental units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| This project is located in the Mechanicsville community, a low-moderate income census tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6177)|
| 1:43:04| The recent economic downturn in the mortgage business is beginning to affect the homeowners in the HOPE VI area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| We have five mortgages that are in bankruptcy and eight homes that have been foreclosed to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6191)|
| 1:43:19| We're concerned that with the depreciation in property values that we will begin to see real estate investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6199)|
| 1:43:28| purchasing properties in this community for rental purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| we feel will have a negative impact on the homeowner property value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| making it difficult to convince potential homebuyers to make an investment in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6216)|
| 1:43:44| The Neighborhood Stabilization Program will allow us to purchase foreclosure houses in the HOPE VI area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| and resell them as home ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| helping to ensure that we maintain the improved property values that we created through our HOPE VI revitalization efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6232)|
| 1:44:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| Hopefully no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Thanks, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| Council members, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| Ms. Rohert, do you want to give a summary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| How do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| I did just want to bring a couple things to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| First of all, you do have a revised resolution in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| The resolution that was sent out in the packet was a mistake, and the revised one is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6258)|
| 1:44:26| It was just the original one addressed the annual action plan, which was passed last May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6266)|
| 1:44:34| The resolution that is before you is the correct one that was in the caption of the AIS that you did receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6274)|
| 1:44:41| Secondly, we also passed out a packet today that is summarizing the proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6281)|
| 1:44:47| just a little easier to take a look at as we're having these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| And in the back of it are copies of the comments that we have received to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| There are about 16 of them, all of them addressing either Habitat for Humanity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| or Knox Housing Partnership aspects of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| Those are the ones that have been submitted to our department as details in the posting on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6306)|
| 1:45:16| Also, I emailed you all last night to bring to your attention that on page 20 of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6316)|
| 1:45:25| there's actually a typo where it says this is for the demolition of blighted structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6325)|
| 1:45:33| It should say $300,000 for that activity, not the $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| That was just an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| The narrative actually describes $300,000, as does the Excel summary that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| So with any motion, I would hope that would be incorporated in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| that the correct amount is $300,000 for demolition of blighted structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| I also just wanted to mention that, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| this is something that has sort of been an unexpected additional $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6358)|
| 1:46:05| This was just passed by Congress at the end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| President Bush signed this July 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| It's part of a larger Housing and Economic Recovery Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| We didn't find out until October 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| the first part of our allocation, that we would get the $2.735 million directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| On October 6th, we were given the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| These were posted on the Federal Register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| This is a new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| It's sort of unprecedented for HUD to turn around within 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| and develop a whole new program trying to follow the intent of the Federal legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6402)|
| 1:46:50| It wasn't until, I guess, about another month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| that we found that we would also get another $1.8 million from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| through Tennessee Housing Development Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| Normally, with our annual plan, which is really this much or less in funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| we take about five and a half months to plan, to look at the needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| to come up with the project, to have the public hearings, to have a council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| In this case, we've had five weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| HUD said to us, we attended several meetings in which HUD tried to explain this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| tried to interpret some very sort of bizarre regs that are part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| and are different than any of us have ever worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| They said, we need a plan by December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| They are under the obligation by the Congress to get this implemented quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| and to get the plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| So we were required to post it for 15 days on the city's website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| and to submit it to them by December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| We did more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| We sent out a press release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| We advertised in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| We've put this out in the Office of Neighborhoods newsletter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Despite the short time frame and the fact that there wasn't time for public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| other than this hearing tonight, we wanted to make sure that people had an opportunity to know about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6489)|
| 1:48:16| so that we could answer any questions and have as full a disclosure as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| given this five-week time period instead of a five-and-a-half-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| You all know the way we normally approach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| In fact, this year we're actually going to take six-and-a-half months to prepare for our annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| We're having our first public meeting for next year's plan this December, December 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| So we're starting a month early in order to give the community, us, and you all plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| Unfortunately, I have found out from HUD, because of the continuing resolution right now with Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| we may not find out the exact amount we're going to get until later than normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| but we at least want to start our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| So I just wanted you to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| I want the public to understand the reason why this is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| and why, in fact, you all are being asked to support this plan even prior to the end of the public comment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6540)|
| 1:49:06| Of course, the other problem is that Thanksgiving, the holidays, people aren't going to be around as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6546)|
| 1:49:14| So in addressing what we tried to do, given the regulations I sent you all in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6554)|
| 1:49:21| it lists what are the eligible uses for this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| We tried to build upon the existing strategies that this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| the administration has put forth through our annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| and this council has supported this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| Neighborhood stabilization is really our theme in our annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| We focus on public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| We focus on support of the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| And we also needed to identify projects and nonprofit partners that had the capacity to do what these funds will allow us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6590)|
| 1:50:02| And that's why you see a proposal to work with Habitat, to work with Knox Housing Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| and to work with KCDC in addition to addressing the chronic homeless issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| So I'm glad to, if you have any questions about how those are selected or our strategy in selecting those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| I'd be glad to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| I don't know how many people are here tonight that want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| It may be that there are more than three that want to speak for, against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| or at least express some thoughts and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| And given the extraordinary circumstances where we have a public comment period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| because of this bizarre way that we've been handed this from Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| we're so limited in what we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| and the public comment period is still ongoing when this council is being asked to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| I think it would be beneficial if anybody that's here that wants to speak to this has an opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6658)|
| 1:51:06| And that doesn't mean we get adequate comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| That's not the same as having been able to go through the entire public comment period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| and have a special public meeting on it and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| That doesn't appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| It's going to be possible before we vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| So I guess I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules so that anyone who wants to speak to this tonight can speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Just kind of by a common nod, I think we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| We'll try to keep everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| For right now, there's nobody else signed up, but if folks want to get up, I think it's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| Do you have anything else, Joe, for now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| No bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| One of the things that was addressed in many of my emails was the allocation within these neighborhood stabilization funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6709)|
| 1:51:57| for MinnVilla and the perception that we were increasing the budget for the MinnVilla project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6717)|
| 1:52:04| Could you address how these new funds fit into the budget that we had already created and we're working with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6724)|
| 1:52:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| And John Lawler may want to address this as well, but I'll tell you my part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6732)|
| 1:52:18| The last time we came to council addressing the MinnVilla project was back in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6738)|
| 1:52:24| when there was a request that the city IDB grant a pilot to MinnVilla Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6744)|
| 1:52:33| At that time, the budget was about $7 million, and it remains the same amount at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6753)|
| 1:52:42| When we brought that to you, I also told you that in the next few months we would be bringing a contract with VMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6762)|
| 1:52:54| to provide additional funding from our annual plan dollars of $250,000 for home funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6774)|
| 1:53:02| $100,000 CDBG, and $100,000 from the house program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| Since then, and also Knox County had asked that we accept $250,000 if commission approves it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6788)|
| 1:53:17| to monitor those dollars from MinnVilla since we have to monitor our dollars anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6797)|
| 1:53:23| and it would just be doing the county community development department basically a favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| rather than everybody having to monitor the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| Since then, that was basically an extra $450,000 in addition to the $460,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| that was originally put into this project for the acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| In August, I had anticipated having a total contribution from the federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| that come to our department throughout all these years of $910,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| When the NSP dollars, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program dollars, were announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6836)|
| 1:54:03| we, John, folks from the 10-year plan, we all started talking about the needs to promote this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6843)|
| 1:54:10| and some things had changed in the markets in addressing this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| and John can speak to it better than I can except that what we hoped to do with these dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| was to fill some gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| The project did not increase in cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| It's still the $7 million, but there are some gaps that have existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| We actually had a consultant provided by HUD come in and really take a look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6870)|
| 1:54:36| at the cost to make sure that the costs that were being estimated were correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| and to really look at how to utilize the federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| This is a complex funding project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| We identified potential gap in the sale of the tax credits because the original estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6889)|
| 1:54:55| because of the way the market's been recently, she said to be safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| we really need to expect to sell the tax credits for less than had originally been anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| In addition, some federal funds, SHP funds they're called, that they had previously received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6905)|
| 1:55:13| or are obligated, $100,000 of that that could go to construction was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| and they needed to go to support services, so there was a gap of $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| In addition, looking at this, we decided that instead of putting $250,000 in HOME,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6924)|
| 1:55:32| we would rather pull that out and use that for another project and use NSP dollars for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| because the HOME dollars add a lot of complicating regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| and requirements that just further burden this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| Another additional cost, let me look at my summary here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6948)|
| 1:55:55| There has always been a desire, and I know John has mentioned this in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| that these projects, they do best, what's recommended is if the project can start without long-term mortgage debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6958)|
| 1:56:05| And so $350,000 of this appropriation that we have down would go to reduce that first mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6965)|
| 1:56:13| that they would be saddled with when this project starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| In addition, we requested and VMC and the developers have responded positively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6976)|
| 1:56:24| to our request that this project be ENERGY STAR certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| You know we're doing all of our homes now, replacement homes that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6988)|
| 1:56:32| we are really promoting energy efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| And so they have agreed to this, and so we are also putting in an extra $25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| which is our estimate for what it will cost to have this project certified as ENERGY STAR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| which shows that they're meeting third-party certification that this is meeting ENERGY STAR efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7006)|
| 1:56:57| So it's a long way of answering your question, but I wanted to be thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7017)|
| 1:57:02| So what we are, so we went from $910,000 in August to $1.635 million now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7022)|
| 1:57:13| which is an additional, nets out to be an additional $725,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| What this means is that if this is approved, $1.635 million would come from city federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7039)|
| 1:57:29| That would be approximately 23% of the total construction budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7049)|
| 1:57:39| My follow-up question, I guess, is to direct to Mr. Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| He and I spoke on the phone today, and I actually asked for this table, and it's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| It's just what I needed, because I wanted a side-by-side comparison where members of council could look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| what did our budget look like in August when we were asked to approve the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| and what does the budget for Minvilla look like now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| And as we can see at the bottom, the total budget, the total estimated cost to complete this project has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7078)|
| 1:58:06| It's just the funding sources have changed because of market conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| and then reallocation of funds where we can take, because we have this new pool of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| we can take some funds out and spend it in hopefully a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| So are there any comments you want to make on this, Mr. Lawler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| No, Madeline hadn't even seen the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| She did a great job covering the essence of it, but I think what this does, it summarizes it as simply as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7105)|
| 1:58:33| but it does make the point that the development budget for Minvilla has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7113)|
| 1:58:41| What has changed, as you just said, Councilman Roddy, is the funding sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7121)|
| 1:58:46| and the amount of those due to several market condition-related factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| and to reallocation of certain city funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| When we originally approved Minvilla, didn't it have a substantially lower construction cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7140)|
| 1:59:10| I think that predates you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| It does predate me, but I'm a part of that history now, so I'm aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| Originally, when Minvilla was contemplated, the big-picture concept was take a building that has a historic designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7157)|
| 1:59:29| use historic tax credits to preserve that historic building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| and then use low-income housing tax credits to create a financing vehicle to do permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7174)|
| 1:59:41| So you accomplish two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| You preserve a historic building and you give opportunity for 57 units of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7183)|
| 1:59:50| that is in conjunction with the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| That original estimate is a back of a napkin estimate, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7193)|
| 2:00:01| Once they began the process with the National Park Service to determine what would be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| to preserve the historic integrity of this building, it became very apparent that cost would increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| It wasn't until, I think, June of this past year that, through a competitive bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7212)|
| 2:00:22| it became apparent at that point that the actual hard cost of this, including contingency, would be significantly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7222)|
| 2:00:30| And it was at that point that we re-rallied the troops to figure out how we were going to make up the gaps here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7230)|
| 2:00:37| And that was before the August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| Oh, yes, it was before the August, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| But since August 2008, we've had a $700,000 increase, pretty much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| Not in the total cost, but in money that has to come from some government agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7251)|
| 2:00:59| There has been a, back in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| I understand the decline in the market, but what's to say that when we continue on with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| that there will be further declines in the market and two months from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| you all come back and need another $600,000 to $700,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| It's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| It's a valuable question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| The good thing about today as opposed to August is the developer that's been working on this full time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| has located a low-income housing tax credit investor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| In fact, either tonight or tomorrow night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| that bank is meeting to decide officially at their board meeting if they're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7292)|
| 2:01:37| And they're willing to also buy the historic tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| but we are also negotiating at this point with someone else on those credits trying to get a higher price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| So we know today that we do have a purchaser for those credits, where in August we didn't know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| and the price that we're going to get for those is included in the new budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7312)|
| 2:02:00| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| I really appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| I believe in the 10-year plan project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| So I don't really have anything I want to say to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7334)|
| 2:02:19| I really want to comment on the stabilization plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| I struggle with it on a couple levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| One is one you already addressed, and that's cutting the public comment time by over a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7345)|
| 2:02:33| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| I still have a hard time approving a plan that still is live to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7354)|
| 2:02:41| I'm struggling with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| We have been good partners with VMC, and, you know, for two years I've seen this building exposed to the elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7363)|
| 2:02:56| I'm sure that that had something to do with why construction costs are skyrocketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7376)|
| 2:03:02| It has to have something to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| I go by that building three or four times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7384)|
| 2:03:08| I believe in that concept of doing what we're planning on doing with that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7388)|
| 2:03:15| But with this amount of money for stabilization, it seems to me that it can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7395)|
| 2:03:23| I would rather invest that money on the east side, whether in Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| There are some other areas in this city that I think need stabilizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| We have fundraisers, you, John, and people at VMC, to raise money for the Menville project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7413)|
| 2:03:43| There are communities on the east side that don't have development officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| So I just have a hard time supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7427)|
| 2:03:53| If I could make a few comments on that, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| The portion of the stabilization plan that is going to permanent supportive housing, you know, there are two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7437)|
| 2:04:05| One is to Menville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| The other is for the development of other permanent supportive housing in line with for location to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7446)|
| 2:04:13| And I've mentioned this to several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| The conversations we have had is these are the funds to be used to find property outside of where the concentration of services currently are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7457)|
| 2:04:27| In fact, they're looking west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| They're looking in other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| So I'm excited to have funds that can be used and can be focused on those areas that everyone has talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7472)|
| 2:04:41| and is committed to looking elsewhere for continuation of the permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| If you'll notice, we do have the portion of these are for the acquisition of foreclosed or abandoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7486)|
| 2:04:58| And the reason why we don't do more of that in this plan, I have to tell you that HUD actually recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7498)|
| 2:05:07| because of the regulations and some of the restrictions on this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| HUD recommended that one of the ways to meet your goals is to focus on your continuum of care, your homeless housing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7512)|
| 2:05:23| Some communities already have a lot of experience and a land bank authority to do acquisitions of foreclosed properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7523)|
| 2:05:32| In some places like in Genesee County in Michigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7532)|
| 2:05:37| they have whole neighborhoods that have been foreclosed upon and they have an active land bank authority and they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7537)|
| 2:05:43| The way these regulations are written, acquisition has to be done at 5 to 15 percent below the appraised market value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7543)|
| 2:05:57| which makes it difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| So even these three projects, we're going to be looking very closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| working with some national advisors on this to try and help these organizations be able to even acquire this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7564)|
| 2:06:12| There are some concerns about when you acquire property at a reduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7572)|
| 2:06:18| if you can even get the owner of the property to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| If it's an FHA property, they'll give it to you 50 percent below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| We don't have that many FHA foreclosed properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| And the last time we checked, a lot of them had contracts on them already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| So it's going to be difficult to follow the regulations as they've set it forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7590)|
| 2:06:36| And even when you do buy at that lower appraised value, what that means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| it's kind of ironic because you want to stabilize the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| but the next time somebody wants to sell a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| if the comps take into account that lower purchase, that could have a negative impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7609)|
| 2:06:57| So we've talked to HUD about that as recently as last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| They've talked to the Appraisal Institute, the National Appraisal Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| They're trying to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| So we didn't want to put all of our eggs in one basket in terms of the acquisitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| because these funds have to be obligated within 18 months and spent within four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7633)|
| 2:07:20| So we're trying to address that very strategically with Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| The other issue, of course, is when you acquire property, you have to be able to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| And in this market right now, it's very difficult to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| We have some beautiful brand-new homes on Chestnut Street, energy-efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| LEED Gold, that are still for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| So we want to be careful that whichever partners we're working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| that they have the capacity to sell these homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| or to be able to rent them for the short term until they can be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| With Habitat, they have self-financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| They have owners before they start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| A lot of us participate in supported Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| With Knox Housing Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| they do have experience in managing rental properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| and they are good landlords of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| And they will be in a position, if necessary, the idea is to find homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| but if necessary, to hold that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| And then finally, with KCC, they have funds that they're going to leverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| that will provide down payment assistance to try and get homeowners back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| So all of this, we've tried to be very careful in meeting the goals of the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| and trying to increase our chance of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| I see Councilwoman Roddy, I think, is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| I'm not sure, but why don't you go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| Yeah, I just had a follow-up question for Mr. Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| The first one was, when you went back to the original goals of Menville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| when we set out on this path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| you talked about saving Menville as a historic structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| but I think there was also an ongoing concern about the blight at that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| and alleviating the ongoing concerns that KPD had in terms of calls there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| So I didn't know if you wanted to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Secondly, well, go ahead and address that first, then I'll finish my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| I'm not sure what your question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| Well, I mean, I guess I just wanted to get that on the table, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| that this project was sort of multifaceted in terms of what we were trying to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| We were looking at blight, we were looking at a historic building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| and we were also looking at an opportunity to leverage some tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| from some different spheres towards supporting the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| So I guess I just wanted to get that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| The other thing is that the next item on our agenda has to do with the timeline for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| and I think it would be appropriate in this venue to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| even though we're not on that resolution yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7788)|
| 2:09:50| I've received a number of emails with concerns about the extension of the deadline for completion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7790)|
| 2:09:56| Do you want to address why your team feels that's necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| And I suppose some of the same factors have led to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| but I'm hearing concern in the community about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| I think the extension is asking for two more years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7806)|
| 2:10:11| and the reason we've done that is to be very, very safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| In actuality, if the HUD funding, if you decide tonight to okay this funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7816)|
| 2:10:25| the NSP funding proposal before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| and if we hear from HUD in January or February that those funds will be released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7828)|
| 2:10:35| we can put this transaction together and get it closed in February or March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7835)|
| 2:10:40| Really, the redevelopment timetable from here to the point of completion is an easy year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7840)|
| 2:10:47| potentially nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| So we put in there, as you can see, almost two years to be safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| because the last thing we wanted to do was come back and ask for one more extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7853)|
| 2:10:59| And those were a lot of words to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7859)|
| 2:11:02| we are working like crazy to get all the funding sources put together in the right way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| in order to close the transaction so we can begin construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| The developers stayed in consistent contact with the construction company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| keeping them apprised of where we are so that when we're ready, they're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7876)|
| 2:11:23| Councilman Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| I want to go back to Councilman Woodhull's comments about Mandela| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| and about where these funds are being invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| One thing that jumps out at me is the mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7895)|
| 2:11:39| buying down the first mortgage with the NSP funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7899)|
| 2:11:43| as well as I can understand the markets shifting some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| therefore less of an attractive market for the tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| how those numbers could have changed some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| I can see moving home and house funds around to put those funds in slots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7915)|
| 2:12:03| where in applications where they work better and make more sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7923)|
| 2:12:07| maybe you're less burdensome to this project because it's so difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| obviously, a project already is the time frame that Mr. Lawler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7930)|
| 2:12:16| and Councilman Roddy have addressed indicates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| But the first mortgage, as it stood up to now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| was about 10% of the total cost, construction cost, of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7946)|
| 2:12:32| And that, to me, seems like a very fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| and reasonable number for the organization to have to bear themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| rather than being just handed public dollars on a platter for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7962)|
| 2:12:48| And to reduce that by more than half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| rather than putting the money into other neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7971)|
| 2:12:54| as Councilman Woodhull indicated, that may be even more needy in some ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7974)|
| 2:13:01| and I have a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| And I can understand that you want to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| and that you see it may be beneficial to the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7988)|
| 2:13:11| but I think I agree with Councilman Woodhull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| that the organization has the ability to raise money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| They've certainly done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| And they have the ability to raise money again, and that's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| and we're not talking the $7 million, we're talking 10% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8004)|
| 2:13:29| So in a mortgage that I assume would be a fairly long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| so that they wouldn't have to raise it all at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| they can raise it over some, essentially the life of the mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| whether it's a 30-year note or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| So, I mean, you don't have to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| I'm just saying, I'm making a statement at this point that I have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| You can respond if you want, but I just have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8032)|
| 2:13:56| And I know we have other people that want to speak here tonight too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| so I would like to hear from some of the other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| Could I respond to that, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| You're free to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| Then I would like to hear from, I don't know, the rest of the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| I'd like to hear from some other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| I see other lights on too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| It's a valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| Two things I want to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Number one, people who operate permanent supportive housing always advise the ownership entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| to do everything they can to go into something like this with no debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| The reason is the clients you're serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| and their ability to have a guaranteed payment source is always questionable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| because there's a tension between, in the Housing First model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8073)|
| 2:14:36| getting someone in as fast as possible as long as they're connected at the hip to a case manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8076)|
| 2:14:42| and getting them qualified with KCDC or others such that they have a valid payment source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8082)|
| 2:14:49| So, at times, they may be in there without a payment source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| and so they aren't generating revenue to help you with operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| So the more you can do to create a cushion to serve this clientele, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| What VMC said in the beginning is they were willing to step out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| and you don't remember this probably from the pilot application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| but at a 1.2 debt service coverage ratio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| this $7 million is how much the operating budget would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| They were willing to maximize that and support that much debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| Our goal here is to create a project that is really operationally sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| and so anything we can do to pay that down, including the developer contributing $850,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8127)|
| 2:15:33| a fee that is due to him to this project to pay down the debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8133)|
| 2:15:41| we've worked from every angle to get it as small as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| to guarantee that this can be operationally sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8149)|
| 2:15:50| Councilman Becker, I think, is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| Well, I was actually going to say we should hear from folks in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| but I need to follow up, I guess, on Joe's, Mr. Holquist's concern, because to a degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8156)|
| 2:16:02| I think part of what thinking big picture with the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| we're still trying to do the 10-year plan on the cheap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| but I don't think that's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| There are going to be 40 to 50 locations of permanent supportive housing across this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8171)|
| 2:16:19| That means there are 40 to 50 to even more than that neighborhoods that we're committing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| we're going to do a good job on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| So we have to do a good job on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| We have to make sure that these things, Menville included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| but also the South Knoxville and North Knoxville and West Knoxville ones, that they're going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| So I think we have to bite the bullet and say we're going to do things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8198)|
| 2:16:42| We're going to make these things easier to operate because when a facility opens up in Inskip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8202)|
| 2:16:49| we can build it nicely and it can look like a house and it can fit in really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| but if we don't run it well and we have the kind of problems that people are afraid of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| it's a disaster for that neighborhood, it's going to be a disaster for the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8219)|
| 2:17:03| So we can't do this on the cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| I actually like the idea of paying down the mortgage to say that we're going to free up resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8225)|
| 2:17:10| for the supportive side of the housing to make sure that we can do it right is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8230)|
| 2:17:16| But having said that, I just wanted to say we've got people in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| Let me just respond to that real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| I don't disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| We've got $800,000 in here right now to help us get in a position, as Ms. Rojero said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8243)|
| 2:17:30| where we can help fill that gap so we can buy properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| that aren't in fragile and threatened neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| because that's a huge issue with this program right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| and that's what we're having the city council county commission workshop on on the 11th of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8261)|
| 2:17:46| But I can more easily justify moving some or all of that money that's being used to buy down that mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8266)|
| 2:17:54| on that project into that fund to help these other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| Councilman Pelo, and then we'll go to the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| I'll just quickly say I appreciate, Councilman Becker, the comments you just made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| because I think that's, I agree with that philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8287)|
| 2:18:12| I agree with the position you've taken on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8292)|
| 2:18:15| And I think it's really important to keep that in mind when we look at what we're really trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8295)|
| 2:18:21| And then I'll go back to something Councilman Roddy said early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| that she considered this to be a multifaceted project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8306)|
| 2:18:29| And this is one thing I can't lose sight of because many comments have been made about the fragile area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8309)|
| 2:18:39| We have invested heavily in that corridor, that Broadway corridor, Broadway and Central Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| and I think we've invested wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| And I'm personally very excited about the changes that I've seen in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| This is something which I supported, and you know our involvement over the years with the Voluntary Ministry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8333)|
| 2:19:01| with the homeless programs, and our personal experiences with these people who really need to have some hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8341)|
| 2:19:10| in their lives and some opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| And that's all important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| But I just like the fact that the location of this property is such that it does many things for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8354)|
| 2:19:23| I think it does a great deal for the neighborhoods that are around that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| And while it still seems to continue the concentration in that particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8368)|
| 2:19:34| Voluntary Ministry Center has just made an enormous investment on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8374)|
| 2:19:41| But these are services that are very expensive to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| and they need to be in an area where the concentration of the homeless is great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8385)|
| 2:19:51| so that they can take advantage of those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| Personally, I think they do need that cushion because without the services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8395)|
| 2:20:03| providing the homes and that opportunity is not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| So it's just kind of an all-connected thing in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| But I don't want us to lose sight of what we're trying to do for the Broadway corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8412)|
| 2:20:17| And if I just had some amazing solution for Jackson Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| well then maybe we should just put a permanent island there, Mayor Haslam, with some trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8420)|
| 2:20:27| But anyway, I just wanted to say that because I really think that what this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8427)|
| 2:20:36| the ten-year program to end homelessness, has many opportunities for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| that it's difficult to see because it isn't tomorrow, it isn't now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| It has been stretched over a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| And I guess my frustration is that it has been going on since I've been on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| And this was one of the very first meetings we had as new council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8452)|
| 2:20:57| was to discuss the issue of the homeless and how we were going to approach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| Councilwoman Woodhull, and then I'll go to the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| I completely agree with everything you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8467)|
| 2:21:11| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| I supported the block grant in 2006, and much to the consternation of some of the people in the Fifth and Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8474)|
| 2:21:25| or actually that was before, but some of the people who ended up being in the Fifth and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8485)|
| 2:21:30| And I do get that it's about part of the program is ending blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8490)|
| 2:21:39| But I would not be honoring my position on council if I didn't just tell you what I see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8499)|
| 2:21:46| even though it may be uncomfortable for me to even say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| But the property itself has become more blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| Maybe you can't become more blighted technically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| Maybe that's like being more pregnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| But it has sat there, and I just have to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8520)|
| 2:22:10| There's a lot going on on the east side that we could help out with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8530)|
| 2:22:19| In my work at Tribe One, I see it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8539)|
| 2:22:24| There's a lot of struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| So I just wanted to tell you that I get the blighted piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8546)|
| 2:22:29| and I completely agree with everything you're saying about the program itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| Well, that's one thing that concerns me is the elongated effort here and the disappointment every time I drive by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8554)|
| 2:22:42| And I think I've warned Jenny and John and everyone out with my comments about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8562)|
| 2:22:50| So, you know, better we work at night to get this taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| I know I see Mr. McDaniel and I think Commissioner Harmon both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| I'm assuming both want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8579)|
| 2:23:00| So either one wants to come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8580)|
| 2:23:01| You'll give us your name and address and try to keep it fairly brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| Doug McDaniel, 125 East Glenwood Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| Thank you all for this very substantive conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| and I appreciate Madeline's effort at summarizing the NPS, NSP money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8593)|
| 2:23:20| What we have to really look at here, y'all have, and I'm not criticizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| have jumped ahead to talk about Minvilla, which I think is the next item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| But the larger issue here is this NSP money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| And it goes back to Councilman Woodhull's comment about allocation of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| And I'm sorry, but this council, and as well as the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| with the block grant money that they gave to purchase the rescue mission building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| we're focusing a whole bunch of block grant money on one organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| and two facilities on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| If you count that $450,000, along with the $460,000 to purchase Minvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8635)|
| 2:24:00| along with the, I think, well, $1.3 million additional coming from council for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8640)|
| 2:24:07| we're putting a whole lot of money into housing 57 homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8647)|
| 2:24:11| And I applaud the effort of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| When I walked through Minvilla a year ago with Jenny and with Rob and a couple of other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8655)|
| 2:24:19| I asked Jenny, wouldn't it be neat to have a small-scale facility out perhaps by East Town Mall or Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8659)|
| 2:24:27| where there was a local loop bus and there would be access for these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8667)|
| 2:24:33| to encourage their independence and not their dependence on the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| to get entry-level jobs at Sam's Club or Walmart or McDonald's where these businesses exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8678)|
| 2:24:44| There are no businesses like that on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| Unfortunately, I don't think Graining Paint can handle that many applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8687)|
| 2:24:54| We really have a failure of imagination here because we're focusing on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8694)|
| 2:24:59| as I said in an email to each of the council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| and I appreciate the responses that I received from you, a failure of imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| Right now, in looking at the MLS the other day, there are 66 apartment buildings for sale right now in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8706)|
| 2:25:13| And I am sure that sooner than December 31st of 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8713)|
| 2:25:19| we might make use of some less expensive existing facilities in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| to actually kick-start the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| and not wait until five years through a 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| That doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| It's an issue of accountability, and it's an issue of disproportionate focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| and concentration of block grant money on a single organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| that is doing an admirable job of trying to put this together, but it's too complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| In my opinion, purely mine, but I've gotten a lot of agreement and consensus from others in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8747)|
| 2:25:53| for my opinion, that it was admirable to try and do a historic rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8753)|
| 2:25:58| and a homeless housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| It didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8761)|
| 2:26:02| We're two and a half years into it, and as several have pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8762)|
| 2:26:06| the building looks worse than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| I was here in 2006 at the council meeting where you approved the money for purchasing Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8768)|
| 2:26:14| Lauren Ryder was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| Steven was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| And we kind of warned you, and we were promised that the building would be stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8777)|
| 2:26:24| That promise is now broken, and we hold our council, we hold our mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| we hold our administration accountable for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| We're not trying to score points with anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| but we hold you accountable for the resources that our city has given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| whether they are federal resources or they are local resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8799)|
| 2:26:43| You're accountable for how they're spent and how they're used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| and we're very disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8808)|
| 2:26:49| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8809)|
| 2:26:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| I'm Mark Harmon, 1714 North Hills Boulevard and county commissioner for the 2nd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8815)|
| 2:27:01| along with my colleague Amy Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| Let me lay out some things that I think are relevant for both Issue L and Issue M on your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8824)|
| 2:27:10| and I hope that these points come across and guide you in whatever action you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8830)|
| 2:27:16| First, I want to congratulate my colleague Amy Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| She's done some admirable work looking at the 10-year plan for chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| and its own internal advisory board rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8843)|
| 2:27:27| and finding that it has not yet involved neighborhood associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8847)|
| 2:27:31| and neighborhood business groups the way it said it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| That's a deficiency that has yet to be addressed, and it's very regrettable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8854)|
| 2:27:39| and it's a precursor of some of the other problems I'm going to address here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8859)|
| 2:27:43| So I thank her for drawing our attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| The other point I want to address is just simply a matter of the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8865)|
| 2:27:48| There is going to be a joint workshop of city and county on December 11th at 5 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8868)|
| 2:27:55| an important point for all of us to get together and maybe come to some common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8875)|
| 2:28:01| Another point related to recent history is that at our last meeting of county commission last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8881)|
| 2:28:09| we agreed to postpone our action on $250,000 until our December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8889)|
| 2:28:17| I should stress, by the way, that that $250,000 is not, as some have claimed, pass-through money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8897)|
| 2:28:23| That is HUD money that is, in effect, a reallocation from some things that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8903)|
| 2:28:30| It is not pass-through money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| For pass-through money to be specifically devoted to a specific project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| this money theoretically could be used for other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8915)|
| 2:28:41| A fourth point I want to mention is that I am very pleased that the county law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8921)|
| 2:28:44| and he stated so last night, is willing to work specifically with me and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8924)|
| 2:28:50| to achieve language that will achieve the legislative intent of something county commission tried to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8930)|
| 2:28:58| which you might remember was the two-mile radius amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| We had some controversy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| We had some arguments floated, some of which I vehemently disagreed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8943)|
| 2:29:07| and I believe showed had some flaws in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| But regardless, he's agreed to work with me on it, and I'm pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| I wasn't disturbed, however, at last night's meeting that some very bad information got out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8955)|
| 2:29:21| and I want to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| You heard about a famous case, well, it's going to get famous, called Tracy P. down in Sarasota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8963)|
| 2:29:28| The law director quoted it, and he talked about an out-of-court settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8968)|
| 2:29:34| that cost the community involved hundreds of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| And it left the false impression that this community that had sort of a radius or perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| or spacing arrangement regarding permanent supportive housing for the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8982)|
| 2:29:47| that that was the issue, and that was what caused the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| It wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8990)|
| 2:29:52| I went back and I looked at that case, and I found out that neither side in that case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8992)|
| 2:29:57| disputed the legitimacy of the spacing requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| No one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| We have a federal judge on record saying there's nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9003)|
| 2:30:06| What we have instead was a series of rules about the drug dependency of the applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9006)|
| 2:30:13| and that led to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| And so there was a serious misquote that created a lot of fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| and if you just read the coverage or watch the tape, you'll get a misimpression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| I don't want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| What I do want for you to happen, what I do want you to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| is the serious concentration of services problem we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| No one benefits by taking a mission district and making more of a mission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9032)|
| 2:30:38| And so we struggle with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| We really do struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| Of course we support permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| Of course we support a housing first model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9044)|
| 2:30:46| Of course we support historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| All of these are things that are uncontroversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9048)|
| 2:30:53| And this isn't really a NIMBY issue, not in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| This is a NIMBY issue, not everything in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9056)|
| 2:31:00| And that's what a number of people are worried about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| It seems to me that there are two options here that I think are defensible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9063)|
| 2:31:08| and one that is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| The two defensible options are to follow the path that Doug has outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9070)|
| 2:31:14| and just say, no, it's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| Use it elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9077)|
| 2:31:18| Do it more efficiently elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9078)|
| 2:31:20| And that's a legitimate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| Perhaps $7 million over four years to house 57 homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| no matter how creatively designed, just hasn't worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9086)|
| 2:31:30| The other path that I think is legitimate to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| is to have a no-concentration rule of some kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9093)|
| 2:31:36| like the county law director has been willing to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9096)|
| 2:31:40| A perimeter arrangement, a spacing arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| This is possible under the law, under the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9102)|
| 2:31:45| What is not acceptable is to go forward only with verbal assurances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9105)|
| 2:31:53| We cannot rush into this with just verbal assurances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| Our communities have been burnt too often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| Even if there was good intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| the ability to go back on a verbal assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| or to redefine a verbal assurance is simply too great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| We can't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| And that's what I ask you really to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| If it were your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| would you be upset that the completion deadline could be extended two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9138)|
| 2:32:25| but the opportunity to comment upon it can't be extended two months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| If it were your community, would you be upset that you're approached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9151)|
| 2:32:35| after the deal is arranged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| your neighborhood association is talked to instead of listened to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9158)|
| 2:32:42| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9162)|
| 2:32:44| If it were your community where it was going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| wouldn't you ask about the legitimacy, as Doug has suggested, of spacing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9166)|
| 2:32:51| That maybe putting people into the very neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| that has the very problems they're trying to solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| and get out of their personal lives doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| And that community-based spacing all around works better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9179)|
| 2:33:04| If it were your community, and it is your community, Rob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| and it's very close to your community, Bob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| and if it were anyone else's community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| wouldn't you ask these questions and demand better answers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9192)|
| 2:33:15| Councilman Woodhull talked about his discomfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| with the fact that here we have this comment period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| that extends past the point we act on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9201)|
| 2:33:24| Our communities are feeling that way all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| as if they're being presented with a fait accompli| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9206)|
| 2:33:29| rather than saying here's the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| what's your input, not can we persuade you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081118?start=9213)|
