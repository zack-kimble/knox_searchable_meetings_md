| 0:01:53| Mr. Law Director, will you swear in the individuals who plan to testify today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| If you're here today to appear and testify before this, the Knox County Beer Board, will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| you please stand at this time and raise your right hand and be sworn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony you shall give in these matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=131)|

| 0:02:19| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=141)|

| 0:02:23| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Before we get into the business of today's meeting, I would like to take a moment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| say at our last work session of regular full commission that I appreciate the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| given to us by the Sheriff's Office, and in particular Captain Mays, as it relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=159)|
| 0:02:47| the operation of the sale and licensing of sale of beer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=167)|
| 0:02:55| As a part of that, we were given several handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| I may admit to you that this is larger than the driver's license that someone may come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=179)|
| 0:03:05| to an establishment to purchase beer, but it reveals the fact that under age there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=185)|
| 0:03:15| a definite delineator saying that it is improper to sell to the bearer of that particular piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=195)|
| 0:03:22| of identification beer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| So, again, thank you, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| You're a friend of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Wolfie, I wanted to thank you, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| I also wanted to ask you, I saw on the news whether the state's thinking about going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| the sideways license for underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| Have you seen that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| As of right now, the people that have ID only, or DUI with them, have anything but an ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| there's a side like that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| Did anybody else see this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Becky Massey is the sponsor of the Senate bill, and that's passed already one committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| and we were going to discuss it during the regular commission meeting when we go over some legislative issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| Sorry, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| Madam Clerk, would you read the first item for consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| Consideration of suspension revocation of the beer permit for the following establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=267)|

| 0:05:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| Mr. Patel, the procedure we go through tonight, the officer, the charging officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| will come and place the allegations before this board and testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| You will have an opportunity after that to affirm or deny the allegations placed against you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| and you'll have an opportunity to give your side of the story to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Do you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| At this time, we'll call Mr. Wolfie May, Captain Wolfie May, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| and let him testify, and you listen closely to what he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=341)|
| 0:05:50| Captain Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=350)|
| 0:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| On February 6, 2017, my underage person bought a six-pack can of Coors Light at AM, PM, Market, 2800 John Spear Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=354)|
| 0:06:10| Mr. Patel, you heard the allegations stated against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| Do you deny or affirm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| This is an opportunity for you to tell this board your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| If you have anything you would like to say, now is the time for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| Seeing no discussion at the moment, accepting the charges and the acceptance of the charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| I would move that the establishment be fined $1,000 or suspended for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=402)|
| 0:06:52| Would that be 60 days instead of 30, or is that your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| That was my motion, but I can amend my motion if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| Yeah, the second offense would amend 60 days instead of 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| I'll second the motion if it's 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Let me restate my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| I make a motion that the establishment be fined $1,000 or suspended for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=432)|
| 0:07:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| No, it would be a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Could the fine have actually been increased over the $1,000 limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| Since this is a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| It could have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| Because on a first offense, right now we're doing $1,000 in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| And I was looking at the guidelines that we have established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| and if we wish to have a different motion, we can move to a different motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=474)|
| 0:08:05| Mr. Chairman, what are our specific guidelines on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| First offense is 530 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| Second offense, 1,060 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=491)|
| 0:08:20| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| We have been consistent in the past to do $1,000 on the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| Recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Recently, but looking at what we have before us as our practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| if we wish to change the practice, maybe we need to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=519)|
| 0:08:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Did Captain Mays say when this occurred, I was reading my notes, it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=530)|
| 0:08:59| And the first time that they was in 2015?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| 16, January 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| So basically a year and a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| Right on a three-year rolling window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| Captain Mays, did you all check them any time in between those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| No, just those two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| So both times you went, they failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| You know, we had established, I think, 1,500 on the second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| what we've been handing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| And how many places did you check this time, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| 24, and we have one offender?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| It seems to be taking ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Why don't we move backwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| I think the highest we can go, according to the law director, is 15, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| 25, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| I thought we'd make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Did you say 60 days and a $1,000 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| Either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| One or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| That's what I needed to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| I'd like to correct my answer to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| 1,500 for beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| The maximum for any civil is up to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| But in your normal table per session under the responsible vendor, how we used to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=630)|
| 0:10:38| the maximum for that was 1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| So there is no max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| There is a $2,500 max, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| But I wanted to clarify, because you said 1,500 and you were right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| But that's under the Responsible Vendor Act, which they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| I'd like to withdraw my second to make it 1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| But that's up to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| As the maker of the motion, I will amend the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| I will change the motion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| $1,500 fine or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=667)|
| 0:11:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Captain May, if you don't mind, in your notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| did it say whether or not they even looked at an ID or they just sold it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Didn't even bother checking ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=697)|
| 0:11:44| The gentleman that owns the place, I don't know if he's the one that sold it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| but there was no explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| I haven't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| I haven't corrected anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| So whatever we've done in the past, it's maximum, I think we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=712)|
| 0:12:15| We are basically at the third offense level currently, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| So that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| That is the maximum dollar amount we could assess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| As stated just a moment ago, it's $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| But that is the third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| No, that's $2,500 for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| It's not third, second, first or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Would the maker of the motion consider raising the fine to $2,000 or 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=758)|
| 0:12:46| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=766)|
| 0:12:59| The question now before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| The question to the maker of the motion, would they consider a $2,000 fee fine and 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=781)|
| 0:13:11| Further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Let me clear the lights and then we'll go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| I think it's a valid question as to see what remediation the business has taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| and the steps in place to address some of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| The question being, what actions have you taken since being stung?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=809)|
| 0:13:44| Your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Let the young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| Did you not stand to be sworn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Yeah, we just stand behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| Okay, back to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Yes, I already checked the ID, but my mind is like 97.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| I already checked the ID that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| Let me back up for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Who made this sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| Mr. Chairman, I can't understand what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| I don't know if you all do, but I'm having trouble hearing the English here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| So either we need to get an interpreter or delay this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| because we're just going around in circles right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| I think he said he was bad at math because he said it was 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| And as we look at the handouts that we have, math is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| Now, true, you may have to be able to check colors, but math is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=897)|
| 0:15:08| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| the question has been asked about the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=910)|
| 0:15:24| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| I'm going to redo my motion first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| and that the motion that is before us to be a $2,500 fine or a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=931)|
| 0:15:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| I jumped in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Since I wasn't here a year ago when this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| who was the seller back in January of 2016?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| Do we know who was charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| It's a different person, not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=971)|
| 0:16:23| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| I just really want to make a statement to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| Sir, you're showing zero remorse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| and zero accountability that it's not going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| And if your store or if you or your store is hit again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| you will lose your license and the ability to hold a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| and that establishment will lose their ability to hold a license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| because it will revoke the establishment, the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| That's a ten-year revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| So if you want to continue to work in Knox County selling goods and beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| I would suggest you take it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| Otherwise, you won't be in business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Seeing no further discussion, let me restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| The motion is for a $2,500 fine or a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1029)|
| 0:17:19| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1042)|

| 0:17:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| Mr. Patel, it's the decision of this body that you would either pay a $2,500 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| or have a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| That's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| 2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| 2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| You must see the clerk within seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1071)|

| 0:18:01| I don't think you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| Seeing no further discussion, we're finished with your item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1088)|

| 0:26:15| The e-cards, of course, if I could, I could ask the folks from SunTrust to come on down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| and our county folks that worked on this too, or county folks, follow down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| Of course, you know, the e-cards are a way to save money, not only through the rebate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| but also by reducing back office costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| The 2016 rebate amount totals, believe it or not, $784,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| And that's thanks to the work of Janice Orr and Melissa Vanover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| I want to thank the folks from SunTrust for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1608)|

| 0:26:59| I also want to introduce the folks from SunTrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| We're going to take that down to Vol Market and cash that, and they'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| They said they'd trade it in for chili dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| That'll be a lot of chili dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| But if I could introduce these folks here to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| Eric Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Justin, how do you say that name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| Martarama?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| All right, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Blake Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Harry Gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| I thought it was Cross, but I couldn't read the writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| And J.D. Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| I want to thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| If one of them would like to come up and say a few words, we'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| While you're doing that, we'll have someone run off and get this check cash before it burns a hole in somebody's pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| Thank you, everyone, for the opportunity to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| On behalf of SunTrust Bank, our entire team, and everyone that manages the relationship that we have in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| we're just pleased to be a part of this relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| We're thankful for the opportunity to help the county fulfill its mission of serving the taxpayers in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| and we're looking forward to seeing what plans you all have for the rebate check this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| So thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1685)|
| 0:28:23| Thank you, members of the commission and Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Next, T. Allen Clow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1708)|
| 0:28:37| Is there someone here to speak on infrastructure and the three boxes of liberty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1717)|
| 0:28:49| Moving on, Teresa Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| Ma'am, could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| I am Teresa Lawson with the manor at Northgate, 4301 Whittlesprings Road, number 209, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1740)|
| 0:29:10| I am here to talk to you a little bit about a very little-known program that's been around for almost 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| and that is the manor at Northgate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| We are an independent living with supportive services, and we are for seniors who are 60 and older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| We are the only program like it in the state of Tennessee that we are aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| We are for seniors who they need the help, but they can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| They cannot afford assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| They cannot afford private care through other agencies, and they can no longer be on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| KCDC had looked at this program and developed it many years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| when they realized that they had seniors in their public housing that was no longer able to maintain their independence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| but could do so with just a little bit of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| We provide two meals a day, housekeeping once a week, a load of laundry once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| If they provide a landline phone, then they also get an emergency pendant, and we check on them twice a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| A lot of our seniors come to us through different agencies, including homeless shelters of CARM and Samaritan Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1810)|
| 0:30:18| We've even received referrals for seniors who have lived in assisted living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| and have outlived their income and still need the supportive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| We have received referrals from Adult Protective Services when they find seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| who can no longer maintain their independence safely where they're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| either because they have been taken advantage of, have been abused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| or have been neglected by those who were supposed to care for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| And in many cases, we even have seniors who they have outlived everyone in their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| and all they need is some support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Our program is the cheapest thing around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| Our residents pay for their rent, which is based on the HUD guidelines of 30% of their adjusted income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| and then they pay for the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| Our services cost us around $610 to $620 a month, but most of our residents cannot even afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1862)|
| 0:31:10| So we only charge them $515 a month, and we have to make up that difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| to make sure that we are around for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| A little bit about our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| We have seniors who they have worked hard their whole lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| I've had doctors, I've had nurses, farmers, soldiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| I have had cashiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| They have put their money into the system, and they're not asking for handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| All they really want is for their basic needs to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| And right now we are the affordable program here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| And we're very proud of the fact that we're here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| I wouldn't mind the competition elsewhere because I think the need is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| I want to tell you about one of our little ladies that we used to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Adult Protective Services brought her to us because she didn't have enough food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| Her so-called caregiver gave her a little bit of money at the first of each month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| left her a little bit of money for food, and then she ended up buying a pizza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| and hoped that that lasted her until the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| She moved in on Friday, and on Saturday she was crying and asking the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| are you really going to come and see me every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Are you really going to bring me food every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| My staff met me at my office Monday morning, and they were crying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| because they couldn't believe how grateful someone could be to get some basic needs met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| We have 10,000 people turning 65 every year, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| And they're going to need us, and they're going to need something they can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| because a lot of our seniors simply do not have the income for other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| And we simply want to make sure that all of you are aware of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| and are aware of the fact that we're here not because it's just another program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| but because we are actually needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| We have so many seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| We have over 800 seniors who meet our guidelines in public housing alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| and that doesn't even include everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| So don't forget about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| We are the manor at Northgate, and we are for seniors who need us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| and that's all we want is to meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| And I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| Thank you, Ms. Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| If you would wait just a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Oh, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Yes, can I say just a few things, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Teresa Lawson is here today because we have been talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| The manor is in District 2, right behind where the old Kmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| and where the old WNOX building used to be, right across the street from Whittles Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| I'm very active in the North Knoxville Business and Professional Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| and we have been helping out the manor, I know, at least the past two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| maybe with just laundry detergent and just things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| soap and all that their residents could use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| I would like to invite any of our county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| if you all would like to go over one day and take a tour and see more of the manor with Teresa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2063)|
| 0:34:30| This is also a part of KCDC, and please let me know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| and we'll arrange it where we can go and meet some of the residents there and see the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| This is a very much needed place in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| and I'm very proud to say that it's in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| I think Teresa brought some brochures I'll come down and get and hand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| Of course, anybody in the audience, all you've got to do is call the manor and ask for Teresa Lawson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| and she'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| She would love to have volunteers or, you know, your churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| or anyone that would like to take on a mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| This is a very much needed opportunity and for a good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| Thank you, Teresa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Ms. Lawson, I just wanted to thank you for taking on one of the things I see in the future as a real problem for this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| and that is the aging of our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| I really appreciate you all stepping up and making efforts to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| Seeing no further discussion, moving to the next public forum speaker, I call on Amber Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| This is Amber Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| This is an introduction being given by Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I'd like to introduce our new director for the IMES Nature Center located in beautiful South Knoxville, our urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2163)|
| 0:36:11| So she's going to send us a report here in the next few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| but I invited her to introduce herself since if you ask her any hard questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| she'll tell you that she'll get you the answer because she's only been here a week and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| So Ms. Amber Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| I'm really thrilled to be asked to come and just introduce myself and say hey to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| I know that there's been a lot of interest and a lot of waiting going on for the new director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| and it's, to say a little bit intimidating, that's a good thing because I should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| IMES is probably one of the most beloved nature centers I've ever seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| and I actually work on an international board of directors for the Association of Nature Center Administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| and so I see a lot of nature centers around our country and in a lot of places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| and understanding just how beloved IMES is was one of the reasons why I was interested in coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| because I see this community stepping around this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| I see the urban wilderness coming around and really building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| and I see some real potential for growth and really for IMES to become one of the most innovative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| and well-known nature centers in our country, and so that's kind of one of my goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| I'm a North Carolina girl originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| I went to NC State University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Go Wolfpack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| I always have to do that because I love the reaction that I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| I'm learning to love orange a whole lot, I promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| and I used to actually work in the Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| I was at Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont for many years as their education director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| so I lived and worked in this community for about seven years before I left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| and went to the eastern shore of Virginia where I ran a large environmental learning center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| and field station, which was a residential facility with about 400 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| We had 11 member universities and school children that came from 13 different states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| and adults and families that came from all over the country actually to learn on the eastern shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| So I went from being a mountain girl to an ocean girl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| but obviously these beautiful mountains and East Tennessee called me back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| and I will say that since I've been here I have never heard myself called honey and darling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| and lady and sweetheart so much, and I've soaked it all in because I've missed it for a really long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| So I'm really thrilled to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| I'm really thrilled to be here to help Iams grow to reach its potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| It is a beautiful facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| It has great bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| It's doing really good work now, but I know that there's something there that we're going to do together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| to really make Iams stand out and really be special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| So thank you so much for having me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| and I will say every one of you are going to receive our annual report in the mail very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| I had absolutely nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| I will not take credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| It's a lovely report, but I will hopefully be able to take credit for the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2346)|

| 0:44:29| If I can, I'd like to read a letter written by one of his former students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| You know, Dad taught for 40 years here in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| and a few years ago as we were talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| he kind of reflected one day that he thought he had probably taught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| a little over 20,000 children during the course of those 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| And about a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| he received a Christmas card and a letter from a former student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| that I would like to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| It says, Dear Mr. Graham, I know you probably don't remember who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| I know this card may seem quite strange to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| but I just had to let you know that you've impacted my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| just being a small child's friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| a child that had a lot of sadness in her world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| She also had many happy times as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| As a small child of eight, I could never understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| why some people set out to hurt each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| I walked into your gym one day with my eyes filled with tears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| stating nobody in the world loves me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| I am older now, and I realize that this wasn't true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| I am thankful that I had someone to tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| that someone would always love me, no matter if I knew it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| and you told me that God loves me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| You took time out of your busy day several times for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| over the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| Even though I was the slowest and the shortest in my class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| you always had faith in me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| You encouraged me to do my best, and I gave you my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| Till this very day, I still have hard times in my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| but I will always remember that someone 18 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| took time enough to care about a small child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| I want you to know that you made a difference in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| When I thought that there was no hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| you showed me that there's always someone who cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| I don't think my life today would be the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| if I hadn't walked across that small gym so many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| I wanted to tell you thanks for being such an understanding person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| I wish that I could enter you in the Best Teacher of the Century contest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| because you deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| It is nice to know that there are people in this world who can love a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| I will always remember the things that you said to me so many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| that someone will always love me no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| and that my best, even though not quite up to par,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| is still good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| You told me that it is not what everybody else thinks of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| but it is what I think of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| If I said that thank you a billion times, it would not be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| May you find lots of blessings this Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| Once again, thank you so much for taking time to honor someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| who was just a very kind, humble, and good man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2831)|

| 0:47:33| What Kendall didn't mention was that he had an effect on adults, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| and I had written some things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| But he had an effect on my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| I want to read a letter from one of his first principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| It says, I am writing to express some feelings that I have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| which I have communicated to you and others in various ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| Our victory Saturday to clinch the league championship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| brought these feelings once again to the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| In addition, I feel the need to write this letter to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| so I can be certain that you know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| Year after year, you take boys of average ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| and mold them into a better and average team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| You coach, your coaching ability is great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| and I know of no one who does a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| in teaching the boys the fundamentals of basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| While the above is fairly significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| it is not your main asset as a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| Neither is the fact that you do a better than average job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| teaching the classroom and are very cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| In my opinion, your value is the greatest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| in the positive influence that you exert on the children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| especially the boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| Your example as a clean-cut, clean-living Christian young man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| cannot be valued too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| I enjoy working with you so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| and hope your years of continued association with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| And this was written by his principal, Fred E. West, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| and the carbon copy was sent to Dr. Dole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2967)|

| 0:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| I have to state my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I said do I have to state my name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| I'm Kimberly Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| I'm the daughter of Larry Graham and Carolyn Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| So on behalf of our family, I want to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| to everyone for being here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| and taking the time to honor my dad, Larry Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| To Charlie Bussler, thank you for taking the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| and putting forth the effort to make today come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Thank you for thinking enough of him to honor him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| and remember him for the man he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| and for the many ways he helped the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| in which he lived, worked, and served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| You've walked beside our family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| and supported us through the past year and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| and for that we are forever grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| To the members of the Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| and the commissioners, thank you for realizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| he lived a life worth recognizing and honoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| He showed us that one man can make a difference in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| and that kindness truly does matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| In his 40 years of teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| not only did he touch the lives of the children he taught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| and coached, but the parents of those children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| and his fellow teachers and other school associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| He was a coach, teacher, mentor, and educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| but most of all, he was a contributor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| to the educational well-being of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| To the church family of Sharon Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| thank you for your continued love, support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| encouragement, and all of your prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| We could not have walked this journey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| without each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| To the Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| thank you for loving and supporting our family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| and especially for loving our dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| He gave to this community as a teacher, umpire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| and referee for over 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| and touched the lives of thousands of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| In return, you have given back to our family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| through your love, encouragement, support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| and recognition of him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| through the Larry Graham Physical Education Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| The school and community of Gibbs are like no other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| when it comes to supporting those in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| To our extended family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| thank you for being here today to love and support us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3094)|

| 0:51:39| Thank you for taking the time to travel here and celebrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| but know that he truly loved each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| Larry Graham lived his life as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| for others to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| and he's left a legacy for us to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| He was not boastful, proud, or selfish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| He was humble, kind, and generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Today, we know he's smiling down on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| and he would love the fact that he is being honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| Once again, thank you to everyone for honoring and remembering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| the teacher, coach, and educator that touched so many lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| But most of all, thank you for honoring the man that lived his life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| of a true Christian man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| and was an example for others to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3142)|
| 0:52:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3157)|
| 0:52:46| If there be no objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Resolution 17-2-102 is deferred to the next monthly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3168)|
| 0:52:59| Continuing with Honorary Resolutions R-17-2-103,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3179)|
| 0:53:07| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| honoring Jack Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| I move that it be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Madam Clerk, I ask that you read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| We'll pause for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3211)|
| 0:53:54| Commissioner Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3234)|
| 0:54:14| Mr. Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3254)|
| 0:54:24| Whereas Jack Huddleston served as a Knox County Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| representing the 8th Commission District from January 31, 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| through October 5, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| and whereas while serving on the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Mr. Huddleston was instrumental in securing funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| through the Knox County cost-sharing program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| and the process of having a traffic signal placed at the intersection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| Emory Road and Tazewell Pike in the Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| and whereas in recent months the traffic signal has been installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| making Gibbs community a safer place for its residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| and all who may pass through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| The Knox County Commission hereby honors and expresses its gratitude to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| Jack Huddleston for his efforts in securing the funding for placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| of the new traffic signal in the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Mr. Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| and after its passage as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| There are only three sentences there that make a big difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| and I believe that as a campaign sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| Jack could be elected mayor of Luttrell hands down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| because what has happened in the Gibbs community is that where traffic waits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| used to be 25 and 30 minutes at a time from like 4.30 to 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| those traffic waits have disappeared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| and I thought it appropriate that this occurred while Commissioner Jack Huddleston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| was a member of Knox County Commission, and he needed a pat on the back for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| Here, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| I don't know what for, but I'm just glad to be at the right place at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| Mr. Ragsdale agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| We were the first shared road in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| With the help of Ragsdale, we added up $400,000 to get it off the ground in 07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| and it took 10 years to get the job done, so thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3412)|
| 0:57:14| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| Continuing on, the next item, excuse me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| If you don't mind, Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to add one thing about Mr. Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| I'm getting a note, Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| You know, as you go around Knox County, there are not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| but there are some people that you just, they care about Knox County so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| and they love it, and they want to see it done right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| and Jack is a great example of that, of what he does in the Gibbs, Coryton, that area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| He cares and loves that area so much that he wants it done right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| and I just think that's honorable, and we need a lot more people like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| So, Jack, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3482)|

| 0:58:32| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| This evening's devotional, we will have a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| Please stand, followed by the pledge led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| by Commissioner Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3524)|
| 0:59:03| If you would, face the flag with a proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3543)|
| 0:59:11| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3557)|
| 0:59:31| We are now down to the amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| I know of nothing to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Are there items to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| Items to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Item 203 is deferred to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| Mr. VandeVate, did you have an add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| A deferral when you're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Deferral of item number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| 414.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Resolution 414.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| This is a new contract for auto parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| The law director's office and the vendor are in the final stages of tweaking the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| so we don't have it before you today, but we will have it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| Thank you, Mr. VandeVate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| That's item 414.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| Are there other deferrals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| The two deferrals are 203 and 414.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| If not, excuse me, Mr. VandeVate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| Better eyes than mine, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| I mentioned auto parts because I'm sitting with your fleet manager, Philip May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| That agreement is ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| It's the agreement with Vulcan Materials for the realignment of Buttermilk Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| It is 414.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| I did have that right, but it is the realignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Mr. Sanders in Mr. Armstrong's office has been tweaking the agreement, and it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| a couple odds and ends that we need to square away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| So the auto parts store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| Buttermilk Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| The materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| She brought this to us just today, Vulcan Materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| Is it good, or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| She just dropped it off to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| It may have, if it has come in, it's come in through the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| There was an issue, Mr. Armstrong, of indemnification, and it came down to the 11th hour, so it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| very well have come in in between the last time that Jim and I had contact with Vulcan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| Materials and this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| The one that you all have before you right now has the changes that we approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| I mean, this was just finished just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3702)|
| 1:01:49| You want to review it a lot before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| Yeah, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| If we can leave it on the agenda, as long as it's got Vulcan Materials' issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| indemnification resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| There was a name issue and an indemnification issue, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| And I think those have been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| If they've both been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Indemnification was still being sorted out this morning, but if it's been corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| we are good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Give me a minute to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| If we could leave it on the agenda, Mr. Chairman, then we may be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| Daniel's back in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| Daniel, would you come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3736)|
| 1:02:32| Mr. Sanders advises we are ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| The ink is still wet, but we are ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| The item is on consent and it has no substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| It will remain on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| Are there items to be withdrawn from the consent calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| If not, do I hear a motion that the agenda be set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| No, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| Commissioner Busler, did you want to add a discussion item on pending state legislative issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| Do I need to name what the bill is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| It's a discussion of items pending in the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| It will be a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| Now then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| I'd move that the consent agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| It is proper before us to say that the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| The agenda is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Consideration of the closure of a portion of Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| The closure will affect the last approximately 1,300 feet of Lovelace Road where it terminates into Melton Hill Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| I'd like to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| The motion before us is to deny the closure of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| Seeing no further, and is properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| I just want to add a little caveat in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| I think it should not be closed with TVA's ruling that they own half of the roadway and the other issue of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3866)|
| 1:04:34| And so I might change my mind if there's a park down there in the future with the partnership of TVA and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| But as of right now, I don't think it would be a wise idea to close that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3882)|
| 1:04:49| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| On that same note, I actually visited the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| And the issue I have with it is I'd almost be looking for a permission slip from TVA to make the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| because it is my understanding that they own almost up to the middle of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| And while the neighbors do have some very legitimate concerns, for me to get over this, it's a TVA right-of-way issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3904)|
| 1:05:14| Commissioner Nystrom has made the most interesting point, which is also I'm in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| The paperwork that we have before us, information concerning the request of the closure of the dead-end portion of Loveless Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3921)|
| 1:05:30| has no reference to TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| TVA is an adjacent property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| And without their agreement in this, I would also agree that the request be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3936)|
| 1:05:44| Seeing no further discussion, the motion that is before us is to deny the closure of 1,300 feet of the end of Loveless Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3944)|
| 1:05:57| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Madam Clerk, I need to back up one line to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Motion to approve the minutes is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| Madam Clerk, the line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| Do we have line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Do I hear a motion to approve the line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Motion to approve line item transfers is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=3998)|

| 1:26:13| I think one good consideration of what was just read for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5173)|

| 1:26:53| of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| the act of our legislators in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Charlie Bussler, I believe you, Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| you may have brought that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| but we will have open floor here from everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| Charlie Bussler, Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| there are two bills that came up that I kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| run across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| one was House Bill number 1020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| and what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| it's bothersome in a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| the state legislature is wanting to have control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| over bed and breakfasts throughout the US| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| or throughout the state here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| what it all brought about was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| in Nashville, Metro Nashville, Davidson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| decided that they didn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| bed and breakfasts, small part-time rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| in their town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| they wanted to make it so where they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| tax it, which now you can't tax it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| which makes it sound like it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| a little bit more expensive for our state legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| and have room and board down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| than what they're using right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| so the state is acting to make the state say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| no, Davidson County, you cannot do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| which will affect all other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| and that's what it appears on the surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| and I've had one of the research people down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| look into it and basically that's what they're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| bed and breakfasts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| and I think it should be on the local end of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| so we just need to call down there and voice our opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| that we want control over our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| in our own counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| and there's an additional bill, 496, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| that also has to do with taxing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| I'm not opposed to that bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| but I just would rather have the zoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| control our own boarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| in our own counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| if you understood that, I'm sorry I was rambling on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| I was thinking about other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| but anyway, I think it's an important thing that we check into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| Any further discussion of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| of bed and breakfast bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| I'd like to update a couple of the same type legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| that's going through Nashville right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| I've got one question that is pertaining to the bed and breakfast issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| Bed and breakfast question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| To get some additional clarification, is this related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5378)|

| 1:29:47| business model, which is almost like Uber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| for people renting out second rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| What I understand from the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| that was doing the investigation on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| it includes both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| It will affect both of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| What bothers me is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| one municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| is going to affect every other county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| in Tennessee because of what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| and it has to do right around the state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| I think we should have that kind of legislation go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| Okay, now back to Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| Commissioner Smith had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| the Senate Bill 48| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| that Senator Massey is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| where right now our driver's license works like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| with the red bar that shows the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| and Senator Massey's bill would make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| so the printing would go vertical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| Hopefully that will go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| It's gone through the first step in committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| and that would be a great improvement for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| beer board meetings, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| Hopefully that will cut down on some of the violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| Another thing that's interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| Is that a phase-in as we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| so that there's no cost to reissue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| I think so, it's still in the preliminary stages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| but usually what they'll probably do is start it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| July 1 of 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| is typically what they do, but I don't know that as a fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| So they'll wait for it to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| People don't have to get a new ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| Right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| Some of you may remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| on March 1, 2016, which was the election day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| and how much difficulty it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| to get through the ballot because of having to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| spin the wheel to go through the delegates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| if you were in the Republican primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| and what happened because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| backlog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| the outpouring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| from voters about how this ridiculous it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| to take that much time in voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| Jason Zachary, the representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| and Becky Duncan Massey filed Senate Bill 47| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| which stipulates that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| in a presidential primary, you would be able to select| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| your presidential candidate first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| then it would go to the state constitutional officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| the law director, school board, county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| and at the end of the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| then you would have the delegates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| so if people just wanted to vote for their elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| they could do that and then they don't want to vote for the delegates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| they don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| so that should speed up the voting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| Another bill that's coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| which will help all of the counties out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| is Senate Bill 678| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| and what it does is it changes the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| for housing state prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| to start collecting the state rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| on the date of conviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| so the Tennessee County Commissioners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| is in favor of that to help out all the counties there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| Another bill that's local just for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| is Senate Bill 123| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| sponsored by Senator Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| smoking on playgrounds in Knox County and Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| you cannot do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| and the stipulation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| the playground does have to be operated by a local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| so it will be interesting to see if that gets to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| because that's specifically saying just Knoxville and Knox County only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| and then something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| senior commissioners are aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| is the benefits of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| County Technical Assistance Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| which is known as CTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| and they provide the monthly training programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| for not only commissioners but the Register of Deeds office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| the trustees office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| and anybody else that wants to attend those classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| A bill has been introduced at Senate Bill 1326| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| to have that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| operated by the University of Tennessee to sunset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| on June 30th of 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| and the state only puts in about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| 4.4 million dollars to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| so it's not a tremendous expense on the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| but for those of you who have taken advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| their training programs, they're just phenomenal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| in what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| there's one that you could encourage your legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| to vote against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| having it sunshined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker, let me make comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| to that. I believe that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| CTAS training rises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| to the level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| we need more than just individual voices going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| if there be no objection from my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| could you get with the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| and pin a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| to the bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| and you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| the commission office has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| my authority to stamp my name on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| and any other commissioner that would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| avail themselves to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| and we do not want CTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| done away with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| you see where I'm headed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| Could you take care of that please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| Joe Lee can notify each one of the commissioners individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| if they would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| stamp on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| all you have to do is look at what they've done over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| they've been phenomenal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| not only just in commissioners across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| but all public officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| the level of education that they've provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| and then the last bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| is something that maybe Dwight Vandervee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| could fill us in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| it's House Bill 496| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| which is about the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| that the county would have to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| Thank you Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| we are aware of the bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| and as soon as we became aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| we alerted Tennessee County Services Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| because we do think it potentially has cost implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| for us if somebody is able to replant property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| significantly add to the inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| of residential development in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| but we're forced to acquire all the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| to support that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| it would be concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| I understand from David Connor at County Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| that TASER will do a fiscal note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| and try to extrapolate from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| what the potential cost might be to local units of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| but as far as I know that data is not available yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| That's the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| I have a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| Commissioner Daley did you wish to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| to anything out of Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| Do you want to think about it while I give my thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| On| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| House Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| 919| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| Senate Bill 844| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| I believe that's being handled like a private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| This is Representative Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| and Senator Richard Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| I believe we commission need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| in support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| those two pieces of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| and let me read something that I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| post to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| I want to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| we are expressing support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| and protecting the survivors of domestic abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| This bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| that I just gave the reference numbers on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| creates a domestic abuse magistrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| This magistrate will better enable our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| judicial system to promptly respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| to incidents of alleged domestic abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| with appropriate orders of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| It is understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| that the magistrate will be appointed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| the judge of the 4th Circuit Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| and that any new or additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| shall be set by Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| You may not like that last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| few sentences but the 4th Circuit Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| does not have a magistrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| that can issue off-hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| domestic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| abuse orders of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| There's a difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| the different courtrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| in that some are criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| and some are civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| I believe this local private bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| bridges that gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| and allows for the prompt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| execution of orders of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| that we're not currently properly doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| I was looking toward Nystrom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| but let me go to Commissioner Anders first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| I think that's in response to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| there's a new law in the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| that states that law enforcement can sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| There was a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| the Sessions judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| that doesn't fall under Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| so the magistrates fall under Sessions Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| I think this is similar to the magistrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| in Sessions Court but it's for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| the 4th Circuit side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| It gives the ability for Judge McMillan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| and his colleagues to have somebody else on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| It's the same courts that Mr. Hammond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| had brought a couple of million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| over the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| I think that the funding is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| because he always has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| efficiency dividends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| It's always in excess of the fees for the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| It is in response to a new law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| that TCA has placed on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| So let me help me restate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| What's happening is a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| can do it but he's not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| You'd have to wake up Judge McMillan a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| So you see the proposition that we're up against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| Thank you Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| I would say Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| I'd also echo Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| comments on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| I've worked a lot with the Family Justice Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| A lot of the domestic violence team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| overlap in their responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| This would be a really good efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| to make the process easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| to get these orders of protection filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| That's one of the reasons why we're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| One of the true functions of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| is to provide protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| Does this cover elder abuse or just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| domestic violence charges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| Is this just one category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| This is in Fourth Circuit Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| This is the order of protection side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| of domestic violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Theoretically you could get an order of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| On the senior advocacy side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| Those are not as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| in need of the haste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| of action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| The immediate need is not there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| That's handled on the criminal side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| That's generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| purely domestic orders of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| I was just going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| This is going to be introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| by our newest representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| Rick Staples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| and then of course in the Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| by Senator Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| Continuing this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| if it is the will of Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| I will also get this into the Commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| If you wish to sign on to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| I will contact the Director of the Commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| Are there other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| actions being considered by the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| that you'd like to discuss at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| Thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| One or two things that Mr. Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| did mention is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| I think there's a vote Wednesday for the fuel tax, gas tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| or whatever we want to call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| I think it's important to know that Knox County knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| the citizens that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| We can get an extra $538,765| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| in gas tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| Diesel fuel is $1,441,690| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| Almost $2 million extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| coming to the county if this passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| But one of the most important parts about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| Everyone I've talked to raising $0.07| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| We're not really going to notice $0.07| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| $0.07 will go up tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| You know a barrel of oil goes up $5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| it goes up $0.07 so we really don't notice that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| And there is also indexing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| I've talked to my state reps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| and they're going to control the indexing part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| Mr. VandeVeit is here and I think one of the most important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| is that there's a bill there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| that the state will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| if it passes we will only have to match 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| of a building a bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| The state would supply 98% of that bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| I believe it's over so many feet long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| The bridge grant program has actually been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| and this would extend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| We have taken advantage of it in the years past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| There's at least some discussion of making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| the same proportion permanent for state aid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| It's been 80%, 20% for state aid for resurfacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| and that has been 98.2% for the last 2 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| It expires or sunsets this year in 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| I think there's some discussion of extending that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| We would benefit substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| from a resurfacing standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| The bridge grant program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| We've taken pretty good advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| Our inventory of bridges is in pretty good shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| We have everything at this point rated fair or above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| TDOT inspects annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| But it's still an awfully good program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| I know we approved it out on consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| Gap Creek bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| That's funded that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| That saved Knox County taxpayers almost a half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| While we have you, Mr. VandeVe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| Help me with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| How much do we spend on roads in Knox County in a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| Currently we're getting about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| $3.5 million from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| Mr. Caldwell in the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| put $1 million in local money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| Then there's a variable figure that comes out of an account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| called construction heavy maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| Construction heavy maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| Supports a variety of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| Including winter weather operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| So Jim Snowden and Steve Elliott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| Who's our paving inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| Will basically meter their paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| In the summer and fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| Pave as much as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| Leaving what they anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| Then when we come out of winter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| We'll have additional funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| To spend out of construction heavy maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| That is a variable figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| But we'll have about $3.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| Plus in the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| $1 million in local money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| $4.5 million plus a little bit of swing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| Out of the construction heavy maintenance account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| But the $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| Additional from the IMPROVE Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| It's a substantial boost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| If you think we're at 3 to 3.5 million in state money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| And you add another 2, it's considerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| And so the number one road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| In Knox County on the study a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| Was in deficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| Is Canton Hollow Road in West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| At this point it's $6.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| But by the time we get it started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| It'll be about $6.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| Cindy went to market a couple years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| And I think most of you have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| Actually I apologize for some of the new commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| You may not have this and we will send you a copy of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| Cindy went to market a couple years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| And had a consulting firm develop what we call an STP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| Transportation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| And it identified needed improvements within our existing system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| Based on crash data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| Crash data capacity and some other variables of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| And that's what we work off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| The number one road listed on the STP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| Is in Commissioner Schoonmaker's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| That's Canton Hollow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| Can I just make one other comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| On this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| I was thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| That the expense there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| Was $21 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| No, you're right, $6.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| On one road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| And the entire list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| The grand total of the top 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| Is $146 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| We need to be looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| And that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| Correct me if I'm wrong, Dwight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| That's just to bring some roads up to standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| That's not even remotely close to the deficiencies we have in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| Would that be a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| Without you getting in trouble by your boss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| The priority list was the top 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| They did a larger inventory than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| If you recall in the fold out section of the STP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| There was a top 25 set of locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| That needed to be improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| It is a little bit of a moving target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| As you make improvements on one section of a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| It may create improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| On another section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| So that section will come down or off that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| As capacity issues are addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| The STP is our benchmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| That's what we work off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| And if any of you don't have it, I do want to make sure we get you a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| Are you staying with roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| Yes, I wanted to follow up on what Commissioner Daley said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| On House Bill 534| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| Or as Dwight knows it, the IMPROVE Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| The other key thing is not only is $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| Coming in from both the fuel and diesel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| This plan has got $5.1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| To go directly to bridge improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| For Knox County only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| So that's a sizable sum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| So did you hear what Commissioner Smith just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| He said what we ought to do is just take that $5.1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| And make Canton Hollow a bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| And then one last comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| I'll make another comment on roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| In looking at the significant amount of paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| That's being rolled out right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| On road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| Some folks are saying we're trading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| Sales tax for food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| For| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| 7 cents a gallon on gasoline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| And I would offer to you that everyone here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| Buys food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| But 45% of the fuel purchased in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| Is purchased by non-residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| Of the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| That's on gasoline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| 45% is purchased by people out of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| And in diesel fuel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| It's an even higher percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| Half the diesel fuel purchased in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| Is purchased by people outside the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| So as we speak about road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| I believe we need to dig into the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| About where is the money coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| And how it will assist us here in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| Anyone else wishing to speak to road improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| If not, are there other items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| Within the purview of the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| That anyone would want to comment on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| There being no further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| We will reassemble at 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| For zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| This is called the order of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| Zoning meeting for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| February 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| Madam Clerk, would you call the roll please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6771)|

| 1:53:13| Commissioner Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| Commissioner Brantley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| 10 members present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| Madam Clerk, the first item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| Name and address for the record, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6811)|

| 1:53:37| 4911 Gann Trail, Raleigh, NC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| Mr. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| Members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| The Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| Recommended by a vote of 14-0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| That the property be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| For a density of up to 2.5 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| In the planned residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| This is a smaller density than requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| By the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| But is compatible with the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| Of the Ridge Top Protection Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| That plan stipulates that the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| By the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| Would result in that number of units on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| The Planning Commission did receive one comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Email from a neighboring property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| Expressing concern about the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| On Daybreak Road and Ball Camp School Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| The applicant has stated that he would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| With the County Engineering Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| In making improvements to that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| Mr. Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| Yes, sir, I'll make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| So we can discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| Mr. Green, were there any stipulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| In the zoning or is it a handshake agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| It's a handshake agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| In what the planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| The applicant would have to provide plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| For review by staff prior to the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| We could work with the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| To ensure that the road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| Are made as requested by the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| And by the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| So you're understanding that you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| Bring the road up to code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| Yes, it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| That we are going to widen the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| By two feet on each side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| Seeing no further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| Motion is properly before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| To approve per MPC recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| And the handshake agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| All in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| Opposed, no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| Motion carries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| Mr. Griffin, good luck in your endeavors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| Let me pause for just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| I sort of looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| And he giggled at me for saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| Per the handshake agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| But I know that there have been a couple of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| When I have gone back to the tape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| To make sure that certain agreements were referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| In conversation that are now incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| The agreement will be upheld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| In these rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| Lost a little right of way, didn't we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| Madam Clerk, next item please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| I have a question, Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| Is it typical that it is not in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| And it's a verbal agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| It's in the development plan per MPC now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| And so this, previously on a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| That we had, we were going to gain some access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| With the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| Since we didn't stipulate that in the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| The owner came back and said I never promised you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| And so we lost the right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| It's stipulated in the zoning plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| He can't get it without the road being up to snuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| And it does not need to be in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| Because some of it is not in writing yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| It will be in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| Continuing on, Madam Clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| Is there sufficient right of way on both sides of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| I believe Dwight and Jim and those guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| Looked at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| They're of the understanding that there's a right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| There's not many houses on that ball camp school road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| It's mainly used for the school to get to the back of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| But the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| Is not contention upon the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| The development plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7082)|
| 1:58:10| Okay, Madam Clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| 1-H-17-SP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| Is a request of R2R Studio LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| Jesslyn Frisk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| For a South County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| To Art Type 1 to Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| The property is located on the south side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| Valgro Road, east of Sevierville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| In the 9th Commission District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| Is the applicant present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| Yes, Mr. Chairman, Arthur Seymour Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| 550 West Main Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| Here on behalf of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| Along with Mr. Harabi and his architect, Mr. Osborne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| The Metropolitan Planning Commission approved on consent vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| The amendment to the South County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| To Agricultural for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| 5.39 acre property and recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| That the Knox County Commission also adopt the Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| The property was previously designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| As Agriculture until a rezoning Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| Approved in 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| The proposed Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| Would be an extension of the designation from the south and the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| There is a use on the property currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7165)|
| 1:59:28| That is not permitted in the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| Employment Center zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| The new Sector Plan designation and the rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| Which will follow would enable that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| To come into compliance with the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| And I'm remiss for not asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| Seeing none, I recognize Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| I'd like to make a motion to approve so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| By MPC's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| Did you say that there was an east portion to the Sector Plan that needed to be amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| The Sector Plan does need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| The first step is the Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| I think it's the south sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| Should have said south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| Actually, I'm not sure what I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| But the printed word says south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| Commissioner Daley, do you make any other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| I would like Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| To go ahead and give a little history on this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| And then I'll make a comment after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| Thank you, Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| This property is the site of the old camel manufacturing company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| And it is sort of invisible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| It's off Chapman Highway near the county line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| Going towards Sevier County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| The property, for some reason, has been zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| And I suspect whenever Knox County mapped that part of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| For the zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| Camel manufacturing has moved their main facility from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| The property is now used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| Essentially for manufacturing purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| There's a cargated box manufacturing company back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| There's a boat repair facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| Any number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| Really industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| This field here is going to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| For airsoft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| The Knox County building codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| Has construed that airsoft is like paintball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| Airsoft is not mentioned in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| But paintball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| Facilities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| So we're having to comply with paintball facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| Which require that it be in an agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| We will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| MPC is looking at this whole issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| And part of the facility that's been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| For the airsoft field is indoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| And there's no provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| For allowing an indoor airsoft building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| In an agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| It gets very confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| But this is the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| We've got to obtain variances for this use also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| And we went to the Board of Zoning Appeals last Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| So we're going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| In 30 days for those variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| And then depending on what MPC comes up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| We'll go forward with a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| For this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| It's a pretty big operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| Mr. Arabe has explained airsoft to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| I knew nothing about it until he came by my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| But he brings tournaments in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| For this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| It's essentially a commercial operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| But it has to be in an agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| Have I made myself clear as mud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| It's a confusing situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| That's why we're starting with rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| Correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| I met with the South Door Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| They're good with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| We're doing pretty good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| Commissioner Nystrom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| Just a quick comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| I want to let you know that my son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| If he knew that a new airsoft place was coming to town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| And I voted against it, he would walk out of our house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| Seeing no further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170227?start=7421)|
