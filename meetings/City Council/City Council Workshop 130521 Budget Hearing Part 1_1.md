| 1:30:24| That's the role we're playing at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| All right, Donald gives just a real quick update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| on South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| It is, hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| About the Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:35| So how much is actually in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| for the Magnolia corridor plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| What do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| There was $200,000 last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| and there's $300,000 this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| so now we're up to half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| in the Magnolia corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| if this year's budget is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| And with that, we hope to get design services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| for the two projects you just discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| and hopefully get some implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| of the Old City project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| So the consultant that you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| has someone already been hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| or you're looking to hire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| You will see him in front of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| here in the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| There has been the interview process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| and the selection process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| but we don't have them under contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| but they should come to you very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| So like I was saying, South Waterfront, Don,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| if you could give just the two minute update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| on South Waterfront which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| it's a challenging thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| As far as South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| I can update you on two of the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| that we did receive a budget request from last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| which was to move forward with funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| already in the South Waterfront pot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| for construction of Sutry Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| And right now that park is in a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| that looks at the full build out of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| There's a public facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| that's gonna be managed by Parks and Rec| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| called Lincoln Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| and also part of the streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| that's part of the roadway network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| that's associated with the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| We're moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| the consultant is moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| in the constructability review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| We're hoping to get all that input back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| with value engineering and some direction on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| before we move into the final design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| So that's coming down the pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| but we're hoping to have construction on the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| begin by the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| Secondly, the second item from last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| was the Fort Dickerson Realignment Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| and maybe engineering may talk to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| a little bit more about that later on in the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| but that was the realignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| of the Fort Dickerson Park entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| to line up with the Woodlawn Pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| which includes street improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| and pedestrian connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| and intersection improvements there with crosswalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| And that's also probably about 80% complete right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| Both of these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| Sutry Landing Park and Fort Dickerson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| will probably be going back to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| once the constructability review is done with the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| and also when the design plans are final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| with Fort Dickerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| So we'll be going back out to the public with both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| And let me add too, if I may, Mr. Wetzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| that there's been a working group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| we've been meeting for I guess over a year now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| for the programming of what we vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| what Fort Dickerson will be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| once all this work starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| I mean, it's important that we have a vision there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| and we're about ready to bring it to the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| for their blessing and approval to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| So I think it's gonna be a real jewel for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| I just wanna, Bob, what's the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| on the pedestrian bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| Is it dead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| How alive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| It was on the bill yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| No, no, it's alive in the sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| that we have the roughly $600,000 design contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| We are currently in the geotechnical phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Is that correct, Don, where we're trying to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| whether or not the supports planned on the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| and the south bank of the river will work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| Is the soil good enough support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| You know, the geotech work needs to be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| If in fact that proves that it can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| we finish up, we'll continue to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| on the environmental phase at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| And then we're gonna have to come to a decision time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| probably within the next year or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| as to whether we're gonna commit more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| to this project or whether we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| But we're gonna have a lot more information on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| by the time we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| We'll know whether it's a doable project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| both environmentally and geotechnical-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| by the end of, by the spring of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| What's the proposed budget for that bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| The estimated budget from the first work that was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| if you take it from bank to bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| it was $11 million to $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| And then $5 million to take it down on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| depending upon how you did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| So it could bump up to 20 quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| There's still talk with partnering with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| We still discuss that with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| They still realize that's on the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| They, like everybody, is kind of waiting to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| How does the geotech come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| And then are we gonna, where's the lead for the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| gonna come for this if it's to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| Oh, I'm sorry, Councilman Wong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| I wondered if there's any update on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| what's known as Baptist Hospital site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| and what you're hearing about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| We're in conversation, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| there was an announcement here several months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| that Blanchard-Galhoun was in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| looked at it, took an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| We're still in conversation with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| They're still in conversation with the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| That's a live project at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Still live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| Thank you, that just reminded me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| What kind of conversations are you having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| with Tenova over the old St. Mary's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| Is there, is the city involved in this with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| and trying to work out what's gonna happen there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| in St. Mary's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| We have not been, I have not been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| I don't think we've really been in touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| with the Tenova people much on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| We've just, they haven't taken the official lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| and I have not taken the lead on that one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| They've worked their way through the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| I guess, their transitions, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| There's 2,000 Center City jobs there, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| Absolutely, no, there's a lot of jobs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| We all understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| It's a very serious situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| They're very complicated to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| as you all well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| Expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| Okay, I think that's good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| With that, I'd like for Anne just to give you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| I think you all are fairly updated on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| because we've been coming back to Council a lot with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| but Anne, if you wanna try to give a little bit of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| Good morning, Vice Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| Really excited to see that the Cumberland Avenue project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| We anticipate getting to a point where we can bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| phase one of the project late this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| which would mean that we could have a construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| start time of late this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| Again, phase one would run nominally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| from Alcoa Highway to 22nd Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| and would not include the road diet portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| of the project, but would include all of the utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| the underground work, all of the necessary infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| to set the stage for the future road diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| It would also include a right turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| on the northbound Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| and some signal upgrades at Metrom Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| which would really improve the traffic flow in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| We felt like that was a real benefit to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| and get this project, or this portion of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| underway prior to the road diet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| so that folks leaving the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| from either the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| or the Fort Sanders neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| including the hospitals, will have direct access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| to the major points west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| So that's coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| Our budget request included this year is $25,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| and that's a request to ask KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| to study a redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| for the Cumberland Avenue District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| And the purpose behind that is to really look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| at one of the key items that was originally addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| in the Cumberland Avenue Corridor Study, which is parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| We know that there is a lot of surface parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| in the area, but it's predominantly controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| by private landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| And so we're gonna be looking at the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| to focus that money towards creating a redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| to support public parking for the district in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| So we're excited to be moving forward with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| I guess when I ride down Cumberland right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| aside from the big hotels that are going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| and the University Commons thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| I see a lot of empty storefronts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| and I wonder whether we are freaking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| small entrepreneurs or whether that's just part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| of the normal activity, but what's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Because I see a lot of empty buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| and I'm a little surprised with all the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| and stuff that we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| There is a fair amount of turnover that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| One of the unique challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| of the Cumberland Avenue District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| is that it very much supports the student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| And from what we hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| from the Merchants Association every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| they've got about nine months out of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| to make their quota for sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| which is a very different market than we experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| in the rest of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| In addition to that, we'll be real honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| the generation that's in college now is a little fickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| And their likes and their dislikes are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| It's a very changing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| You can actually address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| with the McDonald's Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| They've seen a change in their menu selection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| because of the generational change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| with regards to fast food eating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| So we're having some turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| but it's not significantly greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| than what we've seen in the last five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| that we've been working on building this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| We are excited to see that there's a lot of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| in the Cumberland Avenue District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| In fact, we've got a plan on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| for 2010 Cumberland that would be moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| with a mixed use retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| and residential proposal coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| sometime later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| So we're excited to see that there is change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| but it looks like overall we're moving towards growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| Let me go to Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| Well, two things in regards to what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| Turnover among the merchants down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| has been like this forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| I worked down there back in the 70s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| and it was exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| A lot of people had really good ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| but they just couldn't manage it financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| so they turned over with some frequency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| In regard to the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| has there ever been any conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| about something akin to the CBID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| to help fund these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| Yeah, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| In fact, we commissioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| the Metropolitan Planning Commission in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| to do a study pertaining to parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| not just along the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| but also out into the Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| and the district around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| We found that there are a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| of onsite parking resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| The management of those resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| both the public and private, is very diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| Getting a strategy to fund both management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| but also creation of public parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| where it's consistent and the rates are consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| the hours are consistent, is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| That's where originally the study looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| at the proposal of a bid district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| a business improvement district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| but recognizing that we're setting the stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| for a lot of incremental taxes to be coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| with new development in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| the city felt like there's a reasonable chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| that a TIF increment financing district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| would really support the development of public parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| much quicker than a bid district would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| And so that's the option that we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| to pursue with KCDC, see if it makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| see if it works, do the due diligence on that end first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| Let me touch base on two things here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| to follow up on what Anne said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| The TIF district, this coming Tuesday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| there'll be a request in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| to ask KCDC to begin looking at making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| the Cumberland Avenue TIF redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| So I know that's coming your direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| and that is moving to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| We think we're heading in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| Secondly, she mentioned 2010 on down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| Once again, you'll see that next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| There's a pilot request there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| for five years on that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| so we can get our first roughly $15 to $20 million project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| moving on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| So both those things are moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| You just addressed it, the 2210, that's the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| 2010, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| 2010, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| They're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| For the financing to tighten up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| they're gonna need to get through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| They also still have one process with the cellar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| but it's looking very promising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| And you folks are aware that I was very much concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| about the parking requirements for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| And I think it's something that we need to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| on each development that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| I think there's a certain amount that the city does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| but I think on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| I think we have to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| with the developers coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| how much leeway we give those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:11| We really reduce the parking on that particular structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| And I'm not so sure that it should be a city burden totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| in the future that we provide parking, public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| I appreciate your concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| And that's one reason we're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| We think the right idea is to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| towards the TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| Our consultant was here from out of town, Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| It was while we talked a lot about decoupling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| as pretty much a national trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| We're not requiring all the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| to be at every development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| that you try to get some sort of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| to serve the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| And that's where we think we need to head on Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| much like the Market Square Mall garage has done downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| Excuse my voice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| And that's exactly what I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| is that just like Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| your public parking is what's driven your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| And so when I look back at this $30 million bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| and I see nothing like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| And I'm going to bring this back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| when Rick gets up here and talks about downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| Parking is your biggest problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| And it's also your biggest revenue in business generator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| It's probably the biggest thing that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| And you've done it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| and it's proven out to be the generator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| to develop property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| And I think when you're looking at a capital funding project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| like we're doing with this bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| I think we'd be remiss not to look at more parking garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| in Cumberland Avenue and certainly downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| I think we're remiss to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| maybe y'all already have and have looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| but I think that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| we really, really need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| Otherwise, you're going to miss the boat on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| I think we're right there with you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| It's just, this is not seeming to be the right year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| to get to Cumberland parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| and try to get that in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Because we think we can get a dedicated funding source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| if we move to the 10th district to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| But it's been eight years since we did a bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| or borrowed money, as I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| And you're not doing it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| So I just, I think you're, and downtown too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| I'm going to bring it up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| I think it's something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| it's the one single thing that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| and that people look for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| to address parking issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| And that's the one thing that drives business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| And point taken, point taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| Thanks again for all of your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| And we do have several items that will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| to come forward to Council for your vote and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| And we really appreciate the continued support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| that you've given us on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| We recognize, Councilman Stager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| I was disappointed to see this morning in the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| that UT was buying those historic homes in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| Looks like they're probably going to tear them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| Is that, is the city taking a position on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| Or is that something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| No, I think we've taken a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| We've certainly been in conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:50| We've been aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| Obviously, the state has power of eminent domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| We can't regulate the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| That's where we are at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| We have, as Bob says, we've been in conversation with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| And I guess we've expressed concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| about those houses to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| But they have their own building plans and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| that need, that they express from their perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| But we certainly have had conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| to express concern about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| Mr. Ramond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| Thanks, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| Downtown is moving along well, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| And thanks to the investment the city's put into downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| This year, we're just asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| for the Downtown Improvement Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| and a little bit extra there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Most of it's not spent on real sexy things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| It's garbage screening and trying to reduce street clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| with newspaper condos and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| I've got a list here of some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| that we've spent money on in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| Street lighting, tree grades, planters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| things like multi-meters on the 100 block of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| Those were new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| They're about 30 grand for two of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| We've spent on special event boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| And I know with Rossini Festival talking about moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| we're probably gonna get requested there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| Those things are 10 grand apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| So the money we get there is well spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| And we appreciate everything we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| In the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:15| I'd kinda like to spend some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| on some additional fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| We haven't talked about this very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| but the South Central Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| along the State Street Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| It's kind of a neat area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| I've spent a lot of time, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| down the State Street Garage lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| and particularly down there on Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| And you've got a chain link fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| with barbed wire all along that stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| And it looks like a prison camp, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| And we'd like to move that thing somehow or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| and put a nicer fence up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| About 25 bucks a foot or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| for a nice fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| We've engaged Sarah Hedstrom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| to do some investigation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| It's TDOT-controlled property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| so we have to get TDOT's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| But, you know, in the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| I'd like to create like a linear park through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| extend the dog park on down to the underpass at Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| So some of this money would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| to some of those sorts of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| if we get this approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| Certainly street lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| those kinds of things come up quite often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:09| upgrades to lighting, upgrades to utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| As we have our projects downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| you know, any time we have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| to upgrade a service in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| we spend some of the downtown improvement money on that, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| I'd just like to get a brief update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| on we had a meeting, what, six weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| on bringing broadband, more broadband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Is anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| The CBID has got a questionnaire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| that we've sent out to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| and I've been asking all the folks I know downtown as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| Our hope there at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| is to have a map of downtown to show broadband service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| you know, who's got certain speeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| who's, you know, who feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| that they need more capacity down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| And then I think at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| what we'd like to do is maybe create some broadband fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| if you want to call it that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| of all the providers to provide that map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| so they can see where their potential customers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| I've also sat down with Comcast recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| thank goodness I haven't been able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| but thankfully, because of that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| I got the Comcast engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:14| they just came to my office about a week or two ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| to say what can we do to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| to help provide service downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| And certainly we have our pre-construction meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| anytime we have a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| and that's the time for those folks to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| lay some conduit in the ground to prepare for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| So, and AT&T's been pretty good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| They've been attending Comcast not so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| and that's our two major providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| And I've also made a couple of calls outside the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| for some other providers, some wireless providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| to see if they're interested in coming in this market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| and looking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| And they are, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:47| It's, you know, it's all customer-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| And, you know, we're not in the broadband business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| and don't really intend to get in the broadband business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| nor does KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| So the best we can do is try to get the providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| with their customers and figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| how we can make that work best for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| So that's the track we're on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| And Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:04| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| Rick, you may or may not be the right person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| but you mentioned the Rossini.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| And there's been some conversation in the press recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| about moving off of Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| and cease having, cease closing Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| for the fares and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| But in my mind, they bring such incredible energy downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| and they're so much fun for the participants like myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| Last weekend is a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| Now, Gay Street was not closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| but Market Street by and large was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| and some of the streets leading into Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| Has there been conversation that instead of moving to Henley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| which to me doesn't make a whole lot of sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| to moving to Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| to changing some of those large fares| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| that attract an incredible number of people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| I wasn't as involved in that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| about moving Rossini,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| although I have had knowledge that Rossini,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| that we did want to move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| We've been trying to promote Depot Street, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| as our venue for those kinds of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| We put special event boxes up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| near the old Southern Railway Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| That whole corridor there is just primed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| I mean, good wide streets, trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| everything you need for that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| Market Street is just not big enough for Rossini.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| I think they've looked at that before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| and I know Judith has probably worked closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| with them on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| and I'm not quite sure how they came to Henley Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| how that, I wasn't involved in that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| how they got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| But I do know Henley Street doesn't have any power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| and that's why I suggested special event boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| So we're going to have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| if that becomes a venue for events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| we're going to have to do some work down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| Well, I'm going to go back to downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| and again, I think that there ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| consideration given to parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| We took out, what, two and a half million last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| out of our reserves to find a parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| for the KUB building or TVA building over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| And you've got new projects coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| We approved a pilot for the old KUB building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| You've got, certainly the medical arts building's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| coming on, they have a parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| but you've got JCPenney, you've got Arby's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| and White Lily, all this stuff's coming on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| all residential units coming downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| and I think we're short-sighted not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| you're doing a bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| you're short-sighted not to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| more parking garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| That's what's driving, people want the free parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| on a long-term basis, so I'll throw that back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| The State Street Garage, we're adding the one level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| It's going to cost us $7 million to do this one level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| It's about $3 million a level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| and the State Street Garage can support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| two additional levels based on our parking studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| So, in that one place there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| we could create another 500 spaces in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| if we so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| The TVA Garage, it's supposed to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| 800 to 1,000 spaces if that comes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| and I think it's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:04| It's in an environmental phase right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| as I understand it, which will greatly help downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| The Old City, folks have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| parking garages down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| but we have the free parking already under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| James White Parkway and at Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| that's very underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| What we need there is a better trolley system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| transit system, to get our folks from parking there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| to where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| I think that's one of the challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| plus the Jack Stamney Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| that Don Michelle talked about a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| So, certainly parking is a huge thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| I'm fearful that as soon as we build the parking level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| that we're going to be full again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| which, and it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| We've got all the development downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| So, but we're constantly thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| And I also know the Coliseum, the Civic Auditorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| 3,000 parking spaces over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| very underutilized in the other area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| that we need to figure out some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| to get folks more interested in getting back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| I mean, parking garages are great, but we've got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| We're just not getting the folks that park there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| easily into town, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| Yeah, but some of that's changing habits of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6843)|
| 1:54:05| and that's easier to put a parking spot in their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| and then as opposed to trying to change their habits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Well, a lot of the parking downtown is employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| we're finding out, and business owners and residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| and they only park there, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| They're there, and they're there for days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| And if we could get those folks to maybe park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| somewhere else at the auditorium or in the free parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| a lot of cities have done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| Chattanooga, Lexington, some of those places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| have a really good transit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| with an encouragement of those folks to park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| which then frees up the spaces for customers downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| so we've got to figure out how to get that mix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| better, you know, better going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| That answers part of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| I guess on two sort of updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| with the TVA garage, will there be a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| where the public will be able to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| on the design of that garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| I believe they promised that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| but I'm not as familiar with that as maybe Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| Yeah, I think they will take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| I believe where we are now is that would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| through the downtown design review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| It's not binding on them, but that would be a public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| you know, a chance for a public response on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| That's my understanding right now of what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| And what is the timeline on that garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| Do we have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| Well, they're in the cultural resources review right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| and I don't know what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| how long that's going to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| and there hadn't been any contracts let or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| but I mean, it's something that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| should happen sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| That is, you know, it's moving now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| but it's all these processes are very slow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| because you have to go through the entire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| because they're using federal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| to do that entire cultural resources review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| which takes quite a while, and which just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| actually the fence just went up for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| so that's underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| And not only that, they found something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| so they're going to have to excavate and study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| the house that was found close to the garage structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| So there's going to be some extra work being done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| Got a house with an Indian in it, underground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6959)|
| 1:56:00| No, later generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| No, but it was a pushover at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| as opposed to clear it out when they knocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| So they found something, which slows it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| Right, and then my other question was an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| on the wayfinding project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| Anne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Sure, very pleased to let you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| that we have received our environmental clearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| for the downtown wayfinding project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| and we have actually submitted our request to TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| for right-of-way approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| Of course, those signs will be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| within the existing right-of-way of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| so we anticipate a fairly quick and speedy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| by TDOT for that right-of-way process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| We are still on track to be able to bid that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| by the end of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| and see construction going next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| We still have good support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| The sign package is largely intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| Obviously, when you move from city funds to TDOT funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| there's a change in some of the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| that you have to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| but we've been able to address most all of those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| pretty quickly with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| so we're looking forward to get under construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| first of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:09| I just a question, sort of a motion to amend the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7029)|
| 1:57:14| We have a schedule from 8.30 to noon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| without a short break somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| Some of us are older, and I hope that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| That's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| A camel made this schedule or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| Well, I mean, do you want, we want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| Whenever is appropriate, but I just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| I was going to do it after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| Okay, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| Vice Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| Bob, this isn't the focus of this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| but I'd be remiss if I didn't encourage some attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| towards the north of downtown north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| You know, that doesn't stop at Woodland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| and we've got a lot of opportunity there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| people concerned with, you know, crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| and blighted properties along that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7072)|
| 1:57:54| and hopefully next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| we'll see something in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| I'm glad you mentioned north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| Let me real quickly, because it's not on the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Our Gay Street project is being bid right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| between the Magnolia and Fifth Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| We're hopefully to get that done this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| The North Central Street project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| is still in the middle of its cultural reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| environmental phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| because there's three historic districts out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| on Central Avenue you've got to work your way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| And then the 275 Road project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| the environmental document has been submitted for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| So there is progress on all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| of those public improvement projects in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7104)|

| 1:58:32| through Oakwood Lincoln Park is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| it's a challenging area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| It is a, it's a conference one's going to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| these gray fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| You know, it's a gray field out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| There's a lot of businesses come and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| a lot of service stations, the heat and air people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| and there's a lot of issues out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| Well, I mean, certainly there are good businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| Rankin Restaurant and, you know, Keith Window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| There's people that want to hang on in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| but they don't see a lot coming that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| And of course, with interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| with Helen Ross McNabb expansion, possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| and, you know, crime interest in Oakwood Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| people are putting money there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| but we want to see some improvement, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| I understand your concern, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| Susanna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| Ms. Rice, do you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| you're patiently sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| I didn't want to overlook you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| I'm here to take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7176)|
| 1:59:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| Move on to the next motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| You got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| For her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Oh, you want a break now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| We'll correct your question for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| For Ms. Rice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7194)|
| 1:59:55| Yeah, before she leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| Ms. Rice, if you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7197)|
| 2:00:06| Thanks for coming here and enduring with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| Go ahead, Nate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| You may have been here and heard the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| We were talking mostly about the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:20| going out towards the Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| There was the issue of how does this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| work better with all of the merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| that are out in the area by East Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| There's literally dozens of businesses out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| They generate $2.6 million in property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| and at least a million and a half to $2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| in city tax, and they're struggling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| some of the visibility from the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| and the other issues that go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| And the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| Is there anything the Chamber can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| to work with those group of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| to get them, what, on a better footing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| Because it's an important commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| It's obviously beyond the community development groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| or policy groups' focus right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| but is there something the Chamber can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| in partnering with these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| to help make that a healthier economic climate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| I think, I mean, certainly we'll work with the groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| as they request and need to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| We've been working, Simon Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| the person who's in charge of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| we spend a lot of time working with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| and talking about that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7287)|
| 2:01:28| and some of the things that might be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| to help for marketing to get more potential visitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| But Councilwoman, I mean, it's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| you know, it's kind of spread out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| and there's not one central group focusing on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| you've got the mall and then you've got Harvest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| excuse me, Harvest Park and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| So, you know, perhaps if they could come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| and kind of think about some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| that they might do as a broad group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| But we'd be certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| we'd be happy to work with them in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| Would you be willing to sponsor a get-together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| of the major businesses there at the Chamber or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| So they could contact you or who would they contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| to maybe have a sort of a brainstorming meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| or something and get those business leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| together in one room kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| and work with the Chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| You know, let me start with the Simon Properties contacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| and see if they might have other contacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| with some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7340)|
| 2:02:21| Tim Graham, for example, has all those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| on the west side of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| I know he's interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| I've talked to John Ferris who has the McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| There's a Tommy Van who has that Van Land thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| down by Love's Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| But we ought to get all those people in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| the Walmart people, and see if they can together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| collectively, tell you their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| and figure out how to solve some of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| We'd be happy to host that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| I didn't know if you could be a good host for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| We'd be glad to host that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| Okay, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| Will they contact you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7367)|
| 2:02:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| Let's take a, it's 10.30 by my watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| let's take about a 10 minute break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| and resume at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| I bless you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7378)|
| 2:02:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart1?start=7379)|
