| 0:20:49| And we do have one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| Mr. Kevin Shea, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| Mr. Schweitzer, would you like to go first or would you like any opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| I'd like to let the opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| Is Kevin Shea available to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1272)|
| 0:21:12| If you could turn up your volume just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| I'll get closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Each individual has five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Continue, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1286)|
| 0:21:26| My name is Kevin Shea, and I live at 5930 Gray Gables Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1286)|
| 0:21:34| Commissioners, thank you for the opportunity to speak on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| I'm speaking here today to state my firm objections regarding two cases for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| 9A20RZ and supplemental one, multi-family residential 11F20UR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| which has been postponed to December on the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| There's a purchase pending on the outcome of this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| which includes plans to establish a boarding house on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| And I attended a meeting with Angelic Ministries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| hosted by them on November 2nd, to listen to their plans for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| Based on Angelic Ministries' own description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| this boarding house is essentially an amateur rehabilitation facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| It was described by Angelic Ministries as a place where detoxed addicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| who can pass a drug test would be housed, among others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| when they are not ready to enter society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| After listening to what Angelic Ministries had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| I concluded that this facility is a danger to my community and to my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| This facility, as proposed, sounds to me like a soft jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| Angelic Ministries stated that the residents would not be allowed to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| The plans included alarms on the facility to alert staff of entries and exits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| But the difference between this facility and a real jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| is that the staff has less ability and admittedly no intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| to restrain or physically stop a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| if that resident became irate and wanted to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| This is a very likely scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| considering that they are planning to house recovering addicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| In fact, Angelic Ministries stated that their residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| would be free to leave if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| They stated that the residents would be offered a ride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| to wherever they wanted to go if they wanted to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| But in reality, if this resident became agitated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| Angelic Ministries wouldn't and couldn't stop them from walking off the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| This makes the described alarms that Angelic Ministries proposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| meaningless to a concerned neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Angelic Ministries stated that no sex offenders or violent offenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| would be located at this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| But if this rezoning occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| there's nothing stopping them from changing their own internal policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| So as a concerned parent, I have to assume that they might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| This leads me to another concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| There's no medical standards being followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| regarding this rehabilitation facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| Admittedly, this would be Angelic Ministries' first attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| at the facility exactly like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| They are making up their own rules for how it would run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| which allows them to use staff who, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| are unqualified and untrained to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| an escalating dangerous situation near my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| To add to my concern, they stated that their staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| were in fact former recovering addicts themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| On the location, the proximity of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| to many residential subdivisions and homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| you can see a couple of them in the screenshot on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| along Ball Road is troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| My home is in a 62-home subdivision built around 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| My subdivision is a home to dozens of young children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| who regularly play outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| These homes are typically in the $200,000 to $300,000 range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| and newer subdivisions continue to be rezoned and built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| along and near Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| While helping those in need is indeed admirable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| this rehabilitation facility would be an anomaly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| in this largely residential area of Karnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| and it would negatively affect the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| of this community as a family-oriented area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| If I were in the housing market today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| I would never knowingly buy a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| near such a rehabilitation facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| and I believe any honest person raising a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| would say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| If this rezoning were allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| I believe it would lower the property value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| of the hundreds of residential homes in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| negatively affecting the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| and the county's property tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| I believe it would deter future investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| in this area along Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| This is a tremendous cost to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| for the sale of this single $200,000 property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| Angelic Ministries attempted to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| for this type of facility in the Halls area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| and that community rejected it for these same reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| I agree with Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| This facility simply did not belong in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| That is why rezoning is required in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| and the fact that Angelic Ministries' purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| of this property is pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| on your rezoning of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| shows me that Angelic Ministries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| doesn't think it belongs there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| In conclusion, the residents in my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| invested a large part of their savings in these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| When I did, I saw this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| as a growing family-oriented community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| I now have a family with three small children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| My subdivision is packed with dozens of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| who play outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| as are the other subdivisions in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| I see this rehabilitation facility as a safety risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| within a quarter of a mile of my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| and a detriment to my investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| in this area of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| An unsecured rehabilitation center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| should not be located this close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| to so many residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| and I ask the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| to deny this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| I see a very short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| I just had a couple of notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| that I wanted to make on complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| as far as how much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| and how we were allowed to know about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| I found out two weeks ago about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| and it had already been postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| and I ask that future dealings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| with this property rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| be posted on the corner of Zion Lane and Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| And I see my time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Thank you, Mr. Shea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Mr. Schweitzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1606)|

| 0:26:56| Angelic Ministries is rezoning this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| for a boarding house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| where the staff will live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| We will not house any violent or sex offenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| and Angelic Ministries has over 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| of doing this type of thing in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| We're asking that this be rezoned to a boarding house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| I know that there's been a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| about is it a rehabilitation center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Is it, you know, what does this fall under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| We met with county codes and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| for quite a while to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| that what we were going to be doing there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| is a boarding house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| and that's what it characterized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| and that the proper path to go down for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| was a rezoning from the PR to the agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| and then with the subsequent use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| We met with the community to try to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| after postponing this from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| We have provided the use-on-review package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| the site plan, the design of the space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| to try to be as open with folks as we can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| So what we're asking now is for just the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| to agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| and then we will come back very shortly next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| as it's scheduled for a boarding house that will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| I'm going to stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| and if the commission has any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| I'll be more than happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you, Mr. Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Just a reminder to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| this is strictly a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| and not having to do specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| with what the actual use will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Chair recognizes Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| I'd like to make a few comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| and I realize there's several hands raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| but I'd also like to make a motion after my comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| but I can hold that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| until the other people speak also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| I'd like to say Angelic Ministry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| has always done a great service to the Nassau community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| I've always tried to support them in every way possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| but sometimes in our zealous to do a good service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| we lose sight of the people that we may hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| This is a well-established family-oriented community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| with lots of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| and being in a rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| these children mostly play outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| Having a drug rehab facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| where the participants are free to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| anytime during treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| whenever they're angry or upset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| and be released into an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| that has no public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| and lots of school children living and playing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| on the surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| makes no common sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| I'm all about helping the needy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| but I'm also about protecting the rights of the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| and seeing that they have a safe environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| to grow up in and play in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| And for those reasons, I can't support this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| This is just not the right location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| for this type of facility and treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| I'd like to reserve some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| or I can go ahead and make a motion now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| if you'd like, Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Commissioner, that is your choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| if you'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Yeah, I would like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| to deny the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1831)|
| 0:30:31| This is Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| I guess what I was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| I guess this is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| And when I look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| you know, we're not supposed to really consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| the boarding house use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| It's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| It's just a rezoning to agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| And I can't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| If you look at what surrounds this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| it's all agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| I don't see how we could deny an agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| based on what we think someone might do at the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| And that kind of leads to my next question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| is a boarding house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| I mean, I really don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| why a boarding house is a use on review in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| That doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| But technically what we're supposed to look at here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| is in the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| I don't see how we could deny a request for agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| Maybe somebody could shed some light on exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| Does it specifically say boarding house in the ag zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| or is it an interpretation of the daycare and group home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| I'd open that up to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| Liz Albertson is the staff person on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| Ms. Albertson, would you like to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| to Commissioner Smith's comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1926)|
| 0:32:06| And I actually would like to defer to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| I believe if we have Steve Elliott on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| I think this came down to a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| of an interpretation by county codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1937)|
| 0:32:35| Hey, Liz, this is Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I thought Steve was in here, but maybe he's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| But I'll be certainly glad to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I'm looking at the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| now, Commissioner Smith, and it does specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| call out under subsection I, lodging and boarding houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| are a use permitted on review in the ag zone, the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| Commissioner Smith, does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| Lodging and boarding houses, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| guess we're making that to be a chemical or a drug rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| falls into those, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| I don't see how I can vote against rezoning it to ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| but I sympathize with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| that this application under this zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Commissioner Smith, can you hear me now, Steve Elliott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| The summary that the applicant provided to the CODE's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| didn't mention anything about rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| It only talked about boarding people who had maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| been chronically homeless and were trying to rehabilitate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| for reentering society, teaching them basic house cleaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| skills, cooking skills, financial training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| and some sort of job skills training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| It never mentioned drug rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| or any type of rehabilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| That is why the CODE's office interpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| it to be a boarding home rather than a rehabilitation home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2061)|
| 0:34:21| I would just, if we rezone this, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| I don't see how we could not, will there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| be a process prior to this type of use going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| into this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| And then that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Yes, my interpretation would be if it's rezoned to agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| it would still have to come back for a use-owned review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| for the boarding home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2083)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| I was going to say just about exactly what Scott Spitz says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| is that this is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| I can't see any reason why we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| rezone it to agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| But I would certainly vote against the drug rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| going in there on the use-owned review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| So that's what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| I was going to ask that, Mr. Elliott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| now that you know that it has a rehabilitation angle to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| does that change the interpretation of boarding house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| I would certainly think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| I don't have my zoning ordinance in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| But a boarding house would not provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| any type of medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| And a rehabilitation center would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| which I don't think rehabilitation center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| would fit in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Commissioners, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| And my second question, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| My second question was, I agree with Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| that this is just the zoning that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| I'm remembering we had another situation in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| where it was the request to rezone to agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| in order to have permitted event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| Does that hold true for the Knox County zoning as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2173)|
| 0:36:25| Dave, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| I'm not for sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Is an event center permitted in the agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| in for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| I don't have my zoning ordinance in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Liz, can you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| I'm not 100% sure if that's allowed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| I'm happy to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Yes, it is a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| It's considered a rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| So if you go into the agricultural zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| and you look under uses permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| you'll see rural retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| The minimum lot size for a rural retreat is 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| If people are going to stay overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| I believe it's 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| And again, that has to come through a use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| so that we can look at parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| potential buffers, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| This property is 4.27 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| So it could not be an event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| My final comment is I would encourage people to remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| we're just looking at the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| And I do think until we have the actual hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| on the use on review, should it come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| I'm not going to prejudge my position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| until we actually address it in a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| I've got a question, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| When was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Because I agree with the previous comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| about this being a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| And it makes sense to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| most everything around this is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| So when was it rezoned or zoned plan residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| I have this in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| It's noted on the first page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| If you look under...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| Sorry, hang on just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| History of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| So in May 12, 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| it went from agriculture to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| up to four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Now, I'm sorry, I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| This kind of makes more sense to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| that agricultural makes more sense here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| than plan residential does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| There's no other plan residential anywhere around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| that I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| And again, I don't necessarily think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| this is a great place for a drug rehab center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| but we're not talking about that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| And I don't see how we could not rezone it to agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| The chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| I think Mr. Bartholomew was trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| add some comments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| But one, if it's okay with Chairman Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| it'd be nice to let him speak again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| but before he does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| I agree with the other commissioners on the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| and whether we should or we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| I think it's helpful for the applicant to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| I guess, the sentiments of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| because he may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| given the fact of some of the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| he may want to postpone or withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| So I think agriculture is very appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| as to whether the applicant wants to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| I think Mr. Bartholomew was trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| give us some explanation a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Yeah, Commissioner Hill, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| I will recognize Mr. Bartholomew in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| but we've got one more commissioner we'd like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| and that's Commissioner Crowder has his hand up also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| I'm sorry, I didn't have a mic on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Thanks, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| I'm looking at the application that was withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| since item number 37| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| and on the back of the application which was submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| it says home occupation for boarding house use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| support for people trying to get back onto their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| You know, there's nothing mentioned here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| about what we've discussed as a drug rehab center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| and I understand where the other feelings are coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| This is just a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| but it's the first slippery slope to allow this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| It can't happen in a PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| and even though they're requesting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| they don't own the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| but I understand all the opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| I'm just definitely in an advice of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2489)|
| 0:41:37| this doesn't need to happen in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| Thank you, Commissioner Crowder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| We'll recognize Mr. Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| One of the things I wanted to just point on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| is that this is not a rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| There's a definition of rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| There's a definition of drug rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| and that is not what happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| People that will come here are not addicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| In order to even get in the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| they have to be able to pass a drug test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Do they have a history of things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| Many of them do, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| but this is not a rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| I think it's one of the reasons why it took a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| for county codes and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| to determine what the appropriate path to get to this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| This is a continuation of what Angelic has done for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| They're not a rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| They've never had a rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| They've never had rehab houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| Just to be quite frank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| this is something that people try to say about us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| in order to stir up fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| and get people to not be willing to support this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| I will also say that if it's not able to go in a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| like this, I don't know where it could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| If we don't want it around agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| we don't want it around housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| People that are dealing with these type of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| are dealing with them in every community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| We started this conversation about the use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| and talking about a boarding house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| because we don't wanna rezone this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| if we don't think that at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| we're gonna be able to get to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| We haven't closed on the property for this exact reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| and that is we're not gonna allocate funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| that are so difficult to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| and have the community, many communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| churches, organizations support Angelic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| The last thing we need to do is purchase a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| that then no one says, we want you in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| We welcome the conversation on what this will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| That's one reason why we're being very open about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| And so I just wanna make it really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| It's not a rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| We have no intention of making a rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| And for 20 years, Angelic has done this type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| We're not here trying to pull the wool over anybody's eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| It's the exact opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| We're trying to tell you exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| what we're trying to do there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| and see if there's support to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| See if there's support to do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| And this is a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| that is in every single community everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| And sooner or later, we're gonna have to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| places that we can put these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| And this facility was built as a children's home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| It is out away from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| It's away from where somebody comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| and on the corner, there's stuff going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| There's temptation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| This is exactly what's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| or the type of area that's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| to help these men change their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| So we welcome the conversation about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| We respect if people don't want it there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| or they don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| But I'll say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| the problem that we're dealing with in this society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| is not getting less, it's getting greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| And if we're gonna treat these type of people like lepers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| it's gonna be very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| to actually get them back on their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| Thank you, Mr. Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| You had your hand up and it's back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| Would you like to speak again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| I just wanted to say, I think that as planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| we would be well-served to look at this as a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| and forget the different potential things that could come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| This is a multi-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| And we're right now just looking at an agriculture zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| And if it comes back to be some kind of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| we'll see it again and we can ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| and put conditions and evaluate that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| So that's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| I agree with that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| I think it's really important for us to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Justice Scott, Commissioner Smith said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| that this is we're looking at the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| And currently we're not looking at the use at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Seeing no further comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| we do have a motion by Commissioner Crowder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=2785)|

| 0:50:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| I'm here representing the Knox County Planning Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| We've looked at this one and this is a small parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| There's a long history of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| associated with this parcel and some attempted rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| But importantly, this parcel is a lot 19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| of the Choteau Mill Lane subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| which is a residential subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| done about almost 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| And this lot was cut off kind of as a remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| It was left as zoned as agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| And there wasn't a defined purpose for the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| It was my understanding at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| But it's stuck around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| There's been the shops at Choteau have Choteau markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| as developed on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| And my understanding is that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| when that was rezoned to neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| it was rezoned with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| that would be the commercial node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| that would serve this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| The construction of the roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| has further complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| It's already a small lot, only about one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| And that complicates the entrance and exit off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| So my points that I really want to make are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| there is an identified existing commercial node| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| that's on the northeast corner of the roundabout section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| that serves this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| So it does already have commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| And this one acre part is exceedingly difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| to develop for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| It has a very challenging traffic entrance exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| onto the road due to its proximity to the roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| And I want to point out that it's zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| It could be a great neighborhood pocket park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| serve as a farmer's market or a playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| that's walkable from the commercial nodes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| in the neighborhoods that are right nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| So there's some really fantastic uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| that they could live up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| and it's under its current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| And so you're being asked to rezone this to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| there's been prior commercial attempts to rezone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| prior attempts to rezone it to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| The neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| has got a number of uses associated with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| that could occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| But really we think at KCPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| that one of the challenges is that this is a small lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| and we don't really have a commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| that's really has just limited uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| that restrict the types of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| to like what you would want right next to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| if it was in your neighborhood next to your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Things like a bakery, a small hair salon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| something that's less than a thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| or 2000 square feet in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| So unfortunately, this is an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| we think that the zoning ordinance is kind of lacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| with a tool and an appropriate zone to place on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| that would allow you to rezone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| but really limit the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| to all these close in residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| So we think that if it feels like you're trying to fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| a very large square peg into a small round hole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| that's actually what you're being asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| So we'd encourage you to deny this zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| because neighborhood commercial is a little too intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| for what's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| You've already got existing commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| and there's some really great uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| that think of a pocket park or playground or farmer's market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| that could really give the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| a sense of place and uniqueness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| So we'd encourage the community to consider those instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3265)|

| 0:54:39| I'm speaking today as a homeowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| where in this subject lot is part of our HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| This lot has, as the previous speaker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| has been the source of a lot of controversy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| and rezoning requests over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| And we've spent a considerable amount of HOA funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| for trying to keep this from becoming commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| Our HOA has had several meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| with the potential developer, Brad Pruitt and his partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| And we've had lengthy discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| concerning his business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| And at the last commission hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3317)|
| 0:55:26| there was a request made on our behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| to postpone for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| so that we could continue our talks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| and discussions about his business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| So in our conversation since that time with Mr. Pruitt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| we have offered to him the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| of purchasing the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| and making it a community space or a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| And we were asking for time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| to create some type of a GoFundMe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| or set up a type of a fundraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| so that the community could help us raise the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| to buy the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Mr. Pruitt has been greatly helpful with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| He's even offered up his attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| who specializes in fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| We've spoken with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| He's looking for an avenue for us to raise the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| And it's something that we're committed to trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| He's offered his support in us doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| And we've also spoke with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| We've had someone speak to Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| and they are on board with us donating the property to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| and making a park or a playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| or something that would work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Thank you, Ms. Trentel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| Mr. Ewers, would you like to speak, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| Excuse me, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| I'm Brian Ewers, Dollar and Ewers Architecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| 111 East Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| I have had a recent discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| with the property owner, Danny Overby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| Danny bought the property in 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| with the intention of using it for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| The previous owner, I believe, was the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| I think they had tried a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| and it was not successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Since that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| or anybody approaching him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| for residential use or office, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| The commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| he has tried rezoning the property twice since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| And Danny also shared with me that currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| and he shared that I can share this with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| that he is currently going through divorce proceedings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| and is needing to liquidate or sell the property immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| So right now, I'm also representing the potential buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| who are in their due diligence period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| That's Brad Pruitt and Mark Amrine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| They are wanting to put a market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| a beer market on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| They are currently the owners of the Beardy Beer Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| I think you have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| a operational description from Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| Basically, kind of trying to describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| how the market operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| and what their environment is like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| But I know the owners are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| you know, they're wanting to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| as quickly as possible as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| But the extension, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| of the CM zoning onto this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| from across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| again, it is a busy intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| but that is, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| the reason that it would not be really desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| for a residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| They are wanting to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| put in sidewalks and connect to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| make it a walkable destination as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| The restrictions on CM limit the building footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| to about 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| which is not excessive for the size of this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3571)|
| 0:59:39| And as the previous person mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| that Brad has been in discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| He is offering concessions to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| to help whatever issues they may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| as far as gating and landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| and sidewalks and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| And he is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| also willing to put restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| on the property as far as the sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| if it goes through as a commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| If rezoning does not get approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| then I think the owner, Danny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| is gonna be forced to sell this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| as a ag property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| And then there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| no control or restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| of what the property will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| I'd like, in the remaining time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| I guess I'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| I'm sitting here with Brad Pruitt and Mark Amron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| And I would like Brad to kind of just speak quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| about the discussions he's had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| with the neighborhood and the interactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| Yeah, thank you, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| Bradley Pruitt, 1168 Englewood Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| I've been speaking with Phyllis Trenton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| his wife earlier, the HOA president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| as well as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| everybody in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| all 18 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| And living in a similar demographic myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| you know, I definitely try to look through their lens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| if we want to have happy neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| A lot of times, we're just forced upon them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| In my mind, this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| really the highest investment used for this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| after that roundabout was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| And meeting with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| you know, we agreed to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| put a solid tree line buffer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| There's about six grand in the back HOA dues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| that, you know, we agreed to come out of pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| at closing to kind of make them whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| And in addition, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| just kind of looking through, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| being in multiple other houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| you know, I felt it was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| worthwhile to offer them some deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| And there's certain parts of that scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| that come to zoning that I would feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| would be unacceptable to develop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| And so I kind of came with an olive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| knowing that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| we wanted something that the community could be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| It was a gathering place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| and it was very family oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| but we wanted to make sure we had very happy neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| And then speaking a little bit against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| some of the emails that were sent in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| that I found online, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| I want to make it clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| we are a very family oriented establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| We're not open late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| We don't serve wine and liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| We don't have food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| There isn't a lot of music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| It's a place that if you've been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| that you bring your kids and bring your dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| and it's a place to enjoy your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| and your fellow members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| Mark, do you have anything you want to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| about Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| So just that I'm a member of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| I agree wholeheartedly with Brad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| and again, our interest is very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| to serve the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| and have it be a community centered place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| where again, we're recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| as one of the best places in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| to meet your neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| and meet new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| or have a business meeting, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| And we really think that it'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| a wonderful addition to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Chair recognizes Commissioner Robb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| Thank you, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| You know, as we discussed on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| talking about this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| I think there is a reason to rezone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| allow this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3796)|
| 1:03:16| And again, we're talking about rezoning here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| and we're kind of getting off on the tangent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| of what the use is going to eventually be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| And I think, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| Michelle, if this is rezoned and redone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3808)|
| 1:03:35| there is a use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| that would have to go through next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3821)|
| 1:03:41| Restaurants are allowed as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| And it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| I think like we talked about the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| there has been development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| The intersection has been redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| There's been condos placed down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| So I think there's a lot of potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| I think there's every reason to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| with this sector plan amendment because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| So I'm going to make a motion that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| the Southwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| to Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| One of the challenges that I see with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| is as we talked about on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| the area has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| I agree with Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| and I agree with all the other comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| that it's a peculiar size lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| It is positioned right up next to a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| and there's a need to protect that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| from the kind of negative commercial impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| that could be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| And the real challenge here is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| I see the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| purchaser of this or the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| of the beer to beer market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| That sounds great and very community friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| But what I also heard was the community saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| we'd like a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| We want this to be a community space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| So it seems like throughout this planning period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| it's actually getting to what folks would like it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| The problem is if we rezone this to commercial now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| it is commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| and maybe the beer market isn't there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| Maybe that changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| That's my concern is that if we make this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| that that die is cast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| and we're making it based upon the good provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| that is coming in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| But if that provider goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| it's still commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| And it seems to me like this is a perfect opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| for planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| I mentioned this on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| and it would mean going back to the drawing board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| but a planned development opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| could include a park and a beer market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Those are the kinds of things that can get creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| and make possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| And that way, happy neighbors, happy community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| So I think that's the real challenge here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| is we are making a decision on zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| that will be there for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| And it may not always be the beer market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Thank you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| Ms. Porce, in reference to Commissioner Adams' comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| about the planned development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| would that be permitted in this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| Yeah, there's not a restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| on where the planned development could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| in terms of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| It just allows them to offer public benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| in lieu of following some of the zoning restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| on fiscal things like setbacks and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| and uses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| So they would just have to make the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| that they were providing a public benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| state what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| And there are several criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| that are associated with the planned development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| bars they need to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| And so they would have to demonstrate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| through some sort of summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| in order to apply for the planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| But then they also need to have a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| at least for you all to see as part of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| So chair recognizes Commissioner Scott-Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| I was out there yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| You know, I think the location justifies commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| I just, I guess what my concern is parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| How are you going to manage parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| on this little bitty triangle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| Because when I was over across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| you know, in the middle of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| their parking is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| So this beer market or whatever it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| you're going to have to be really careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| about how we would approve whatever goes there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| to make sure that the parking doesn't overflow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| into this Choteau Mill Lane neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| and line the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| I just, the more I look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| the more I do get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| that the location will handle the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| And I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| But managing your cars on a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| on this little corner is going to be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| And I just, I'm getting a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| It may be a problem for the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| So I don't know if the developer wants to respond or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| but let's, let's first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| let's get through the commission comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Then we'll go back to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| I think Mr. Murphy also has his hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| So Michelle, could you put up the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| where you show all the uses of neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| for us just to refresh our minds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Okay, thank you, Taryn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| I can go on to the Knox County's website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| pull that up real quick and then show my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| And while I'm waiting for this page to load,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| just to point out, in addition to the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| and the actual business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| that there would be buffering requirements as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| because this is abutting a residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| two residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| And so there would also be that 25 foot depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| to consider as well, which shrinks the footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| of what they can put in there even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Michelle, I can share my screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| if you don't have it up, the uses in the CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| I'm almost there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| And I do want to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4177)|
| 1:09:38| this is Amy Brooks with planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| And I apologize for not clarifying this earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| regarding the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| In the county, it is only allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| And it also another caveat is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| it is a minimum of 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| Okay, so here's the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| these are the uses that are allowed by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| I'll just, I don't know if you want me to read them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| grocery stores, household supplies, clothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| lawn supplies, drugstores, plant sales, bakeries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| that sort of thing, smaller businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| Right, so these look like smaller businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| with not a lot of parking going on throughout the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| just in and out kind of things, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| It really just kind of depends on the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| Once you get down into uses on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| it allows a few more restaurants, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| have one of the highest parking requirements, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| And so they would, I'm not exactly sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| what the parking count would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| It would be based on their square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| But typically restaurants see more parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| than your typical insurance office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| And so that's part of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| Probably a beer garden would have a lot of parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| would need a lot of parking, especially evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| I agree with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| What I'm worried about is the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| flowing into that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| because that's just what people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| They have to park on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| The other thing is, I guess they can't do plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| Is that what you're saying, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| The acreage is too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| Yeah, I just couldn't support this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| Yes, I was also taking a look at permitted uses in the CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| And I think that the uses themselves may not be impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| But the lot location and size, one acre for commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| it's very difficult to fit everything on one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| Don't forget we've got stormwater to worry about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| as well as the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| as well as the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| as well as a restriction on the access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| And we have CN, a whole bunch of it across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| For those reasons, I will not be able to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| the CN request for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| Yes, thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| You know, I've heard that this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| does yield itself well to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| but we continually hear worries about the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| I would say even if this one day becomes a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| you're still going to have people driving in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| you know, with their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| So, you know, the gentlemen that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| you know, are making this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| I mean, they run a good business here in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| Can we give them some time or their architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| some time to address, you know, this parking issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| I mean, how they're surely they've thought about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4384)|
| 1:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Director Brooks, you have your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Did you have another point you want to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| Let me take that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Yeah, thanks, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| Yeah, I hear the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| but one of the other things I heard earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| is from one of the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| that they were trying to put together a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| I don't think, I still maintain it's an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| of the see and above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| and I think it makes sense in my motion stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| but I also would like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| that if we do rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| that doesn't change their ability to make an offer on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| In the future, it wouldn't change anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| with their ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| and if we rezoned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| they could always use it for the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| I believe, under this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| It would still, you could still put a parking here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| I just want to put the size in perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| from a developer's viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| One acre is a pretty good size piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| for commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| and just so that you could visualize something like a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| and these aren't good examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| but I know that you all are familiar with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| you know, a buddy's barbecue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| a Naples Italian restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| all those are on one acre or less property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| So you could easily put a 10,000 square foot building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| on a one acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Now, neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| I think limits it to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| So the parking concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| one, it would have to comply with code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| the parking would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| So I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| that would get vetted through permitting and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| but one acre is a pretty good size piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Mr. Mullins, you had your hand up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Would you like to make a comment or you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| Yes, just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| I think Mr. Hill just kind of stole my thunder there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| I mean, if we're limited to 5,000 square feet for a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| then you're going to be looking at over 38,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| for parking and landscaping and buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| And I signed up to speak on this simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| because I've worked with Brad before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| I know their standup organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| standup folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| they say they're going to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| they're going to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| And again, we're at a rezoning stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| I think if it doesn't make sense on a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| you guys still have the authority to dig in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| and make sure that it's designed right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| and any potential impacts would be mitigated at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| And if it can't be done, it can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| And the neighbors can still pursue purchasing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| So I think the points I wanted to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| have already been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| but I just wanted to maybe underscore that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| I'll recognize Mr. Ewers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| and that'll be the last individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| before we go to a vote on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4584)|
| 1:16:31| Yeah, let me, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| speaking with Commissioner Hill's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| if you look across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| you will see very similar size parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| that are approximately an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| Again, we are limited to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| And yet I have done a preliminary layout on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| and we can fit the required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| the zoning required 50 parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| which I think will be more than adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| Again, our desire is to tie into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| and make this property walkable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| riding bikes on the paths and walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| So minimizing the need for any parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| but also the adjacent neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| raised that very concern to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| when we started talking to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| and I guess negotiating with them as it were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| One of the things they requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| was providing a gate to Chavo Mills subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| And that is something, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| that the potential developer is willing to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| and that will keep any parking in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4667)|
| 1:17:54| out of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| but also as the traffic on Chavo Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| is such that parking in the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| would not be possible or feasible at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| So that, I know that's a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| but that is not possible, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| Yeah, just one question before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| Regardless of the outcome of the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| if it is rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| it will come back for use on review no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| or only if it is something other than CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| I just want to confirm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| we would be seeing it again or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| It depends on the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| So if it goes through the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| and this applicant submits for a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| then yes, you would see it as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| If that fell through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| and someone wanted to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| that was allowed by right and CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| then you would not see it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| It would just go to the county for permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4746)|

| 1:22:34| Applicant is Central View, LLC, Joe Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4954)|

| 1:22:45| Applicant is seeking rezoning from office to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| Staff recommendation is approve rezoning to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| This will require one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| Mr. Petrie, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4976)|
| 1:23:02| I don't see him as listed on the attendees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| He was on the call earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| I'm not sure what he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=4990)|

| 1:23:22| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Joe Petrie, Conversion Properties, 520 West Summit Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| Suite 903, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| We're simply trying to do more appropriate zoning than it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| Our intention for the property is to use it as it has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| which is residential apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| And to our knowledge, it's, well, as far back as we can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5026)|
| 1:23:53| it has been residential apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| So I think it was in 1995 renovated as a teen rehab center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| for Child and Family Services, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| through a subsequent merger with Helen Ross McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| They bought, well, they got it through a merger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| used it for a short while for the same use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| and then stopped that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| and were interested in selling the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| I bought it about a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| and our intention is to simply return it to residential apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5067)|
| 1:24:35| that are commercial in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| not a rehab or any use like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| This is just commercial apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| We own, in some partnerships, Tyson Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| which is two blocks away, 30 apartment units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| We do small apartment complexes in commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| So as we looked at the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| we realized that it just seemed to be inappropriately zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| Obviously, we're surrounded by CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| That's what we think it should go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| And the other side is obviously the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| This building is actually called the laboratory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| I believe it was once upon a time a lab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| and then later became part of the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| But it's an old turn-of-the-century building, 1911, I believe it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| And we just want to rehab the property and put it back into service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5126)|
| 1:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Chair recognizes Commissioner Cormillick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| Yes, and I want to thank you for pulling it from the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| as I requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| My one concern was the future of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| I think it's four-story brick building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| It would have just broken my heart to have it torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| I would like to proceed then with a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| to approve the request for the rezone based on the staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| We have a motion by Commissioner Cormillick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5167)|

| 1:26:12| to approve the rezoning to CG2 per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5172)|

| 1:27:19| The motion carries 13 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| Thank you, Miss Edmonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| Before you, let me remind commissioners that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| a pass vote must be recorded as a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| And that is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| This is Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| I just didn't want to vote either way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| just because I did not hear the discussion during all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| So go ahead and record me as a no, just since that's the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| But I didn't want to give it the vote either way at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5269)|

| 1:29:10| Mr. Cook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5350)|
| 1:29:17| Yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| I'd like to yield my time to Jennifer Stenstrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| That's quite appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| Ms. Stenstrom, your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| Hi, Jennifer Stenstrom, 1717 Long Farm Way, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| Can I have a question before my time starts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Yes, continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| Because of the outreach from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| can I, can each of us have five minutes to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| I believe there's two of us left that are going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| That would be 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| And we've got an extremely long agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| We're not even a portion of the way through yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| a portion of the way through yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| But why don't you try to say as much as you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| in the next two or three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| and then give the others an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| And if additional time is warranted, I'll consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| Okay, only because it's the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| and the other rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| So it's really, I feel like it's two cases in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| That's why I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Okay, so good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| My name is Jennifer Stenstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| Again, 1717 Long Farm Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| First, thank you for your service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| And thank you to Hunter Harrison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| for meeting with the surrounding neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| I'm speaking with you today in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| of the low density residential zoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| and potential new development in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| Here are the facts to support your denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| of low density residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| First, road safety on Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| It is the number one complaint from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| Thank you to Mr. Harrison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| for providing the traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| I understand this step is not required at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| This letter states this development alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| would add 1,932 daily trips to Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| Using the county's own figures, adding this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| plus the other two developments already built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| or being built on this narrow two lane road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| would add an additional 3,079 daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| There have been three accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| just in the last two weeks alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| Any solution will take decades to receive funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| This road cannot sustain this traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| The dangerous intersection of Campbell Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| and Yarnell Road must also be solved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| prior to adding this huge increase in traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| Low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| The very definition of LDR states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| that the land use is primarily residential in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| This rural area of Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| does not fit this definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| The Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| This plan states if the parcels have 15 to 25% slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| the density cannot exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| more than two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| Based on just the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| a maximum of 1.93 dwelling units per acre could apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| This would still approve a new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| of over 120 homes on these two rural parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| The Northwest County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| These parcels are designated agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| and should remain this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| Knox County's Growth Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| These parcels and surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| are in the rural area designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| This area was not included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| as part of the planned growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| As such, the agricultural specification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| states less than one dwelling unit per acre be built here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| Again, only one home per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| not 1.93, not two, and certainly not 3.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| Even the current zoning would create a new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| of over 60 new homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| which is still a large development for this rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| Spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5577)|
| 1:32:58| Long Farm Way is a private road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| with eight adjoining parcels on four easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| Due to the specific design of this rural community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| these parcels are not allowed to be subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| Approving the rezoning of the parcel on Long Farm Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| from rural and agricultural to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| would allow incompatible lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| compared to these adjoining parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| This would give this property development rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| that the other adjacent parcels would not be afforded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| Thank you to Commissioner Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| for bringing this important issue to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| Hardin Valley Elementary and Hardin Valley Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| are well over their capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| Between the four other recently approved developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| plus approval of this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| we are looking at an increase of over 400 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| These are just estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| The schools have not even seen their impact yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| Hardin Valley is and continues to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| the fastest growing area in all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| These projected increases could be severely underestimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| Building Northwest Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| was intended to lighten Hardin Valley Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| These five developments alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| could put us right back to where we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| These rural and agricultural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| designated by the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| and the Northwest County sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| are not being protected or preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| What is the point of having these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| if they are not honored, followed and abided by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| There is an option to buy another lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| adjacent to these lots on Long Farm Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| I'd like you to imagine this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| Adding this new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| would create subdivisions touching clear across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| North Campbell Station Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| all the way over to Marietta Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| That is an entire hillside of residential lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| in a rural zoned area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| that is not even in the planned growth boundary area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| This would set an extremely dangerous precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| This is happening because the county is choosing to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| more and more rural and agricultural parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| ignoring the many reports and studies already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| intended to protect these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| I have one last paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| Thank you for the Titan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| You have a real opportunity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| to help Knox County get back on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| and set a precedent for future rezoning cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| If the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| hillside and ridgetop protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| and sector plans are applied as written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| and truly follow to their original intents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| these beautiful parcels should remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| in their current agricultural and rural zoning designations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| to be protected and preserved as planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| Based on these reasons, at the very minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| low density residential is not an option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| for these two specific parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5727)|
| 1:35:27| Thank you, Ms. Stenshaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| Are there other comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| beyond what Ms. Stenshaw had already made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| Mr. Murphy or Ryan Dabbs, Garrett Cook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| Yes, I'd like to make a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| Unless there's opposition from the commission now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| Give another two minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| and we'll try to wrap it up and go to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5754)|
| 1:36:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Okay, this is Ryan Dabbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| I live at 1811 North Campbell Station Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| Clearly, there are many issues here as Jen touched on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| and they should all be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| but I certainly feel the most important issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| is the traffic and road safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| Everybody who drives this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| knows that it already is a dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| That's why it's been on Knox County's radar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| for improvements for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| And last year's traffic mobility plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| included a lot of recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| for improving the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| including widening, shoulders, roundabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| and even the north-south connector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| to try to bypass this area altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| because it was already getting so heavily trafficked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| and it's going to be difficult to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| And so with the other two new developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| on Campbell Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| that are within a quarter mile of this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| there's 75 new homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| that we're still yet to feel the effect of these fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| But as Jen said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| we've seen the three car accidents in the last 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| I think we're at a tipping point as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| There's still no confirmed plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| for the road improvements on North Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| It's unclear, given the steepness of the terrain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| whether these road improvements are even possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| And at best, it's part of the 25-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| And that's only if we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5829)|
| 1:37:09| the regional federal dollars to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| The traffic letter submitted by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| recommended a turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| for traffic going into the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| And the engineer that I spoke with agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| it looks like it's probably not even possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| to put a turn lane at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| So I think allowing another 100 to 200 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| to enter the road at this specific location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| would be irresponsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| and clearly contribute to the endangerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| of all of us that drive the road every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| and that live in the adjoining parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| And we shouldn't wait until there are hundreds of crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| and potential fatalities on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| before we realize that it's too late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| to stop this kind of development along this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| So we hope that you recognize this as a particular location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| just has too many red flags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| and it's not appropriate for a large subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| So this is where we need you to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| this kind of rezoning in this particular location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| with all the things that Jen mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| will affect all of the community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| and that we oppose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| So I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| I urge you to listen to the community opposition to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| and keep the housing density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| around the one dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| which would still allow over 65 new homes on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| which is still a large development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| And this should remain a rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| and agricultural part of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| just as the county growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| and the surrounding land use indicates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| And the lower density zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| is all that the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| truthfully will safely support at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5909)|
| 1:38:29| Thank you, Mr. Crook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| Commissioner, any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5913)|
| 1:38:40| Commissioner, I'd recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5925)|
| 1:38:45| And I do have some comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| but I'd like to hear what the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| or the person who's actually kind of brought this to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| has to say before I address anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| that was just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Mr. Sharp, you've got seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Chris Sharp, Urban Engineering, 11852 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| And I am here with my client, Hunter Harris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| and he would like to address the commission, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Hunter Harrison, 2926 Swofford Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| I have been a resident of Hardin Valley for over 21 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| I have done the majority of my building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| and developing in Hardin Valley since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| I respectfully request the LDR sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| This plan aligns with existing growth in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| There'll be a boulevard entrance over 400 foot from Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| from Campbell Station to the first house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| which will satisfy egress and ingress requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| Property is served by water, sewer, and gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| at Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| Lot sizes will vary from 60 to 75 to 90 foot widths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| once we submit concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| 95.2% of this subdivision or this parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| is less than 25% of slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| 2006, 61 acres of the log farm was approved LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6017)|
| 1:40:25| and approved by NPC of three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| In the last four years, all LDR requests in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| Brandywine and Pepper Ridge directly across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| was approved LDR 517.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| Seal property, Ball Homes was approved LDR 1010-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| Binding Mills was approved LDR 811-16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| Hickory Creek Farms was approved LDR 119-17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| Brook and Hardin Valley approved 424-17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| Houston Homes on Buttermilk approved LDR 419.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| Now, the access from Long Farm Way to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6073)|
| 1:41:18| my contract with the sellers is I will deed that access over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| so I will have no access from Long Farm to Yardell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| On the slope analysis, if we use LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| with the five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| we come up with a density that exceeds what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| We have seen before NPC doing a slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| of three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| That would come up to 185 units or 2.88 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| I will have Chris Sharp discuss road information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| but we have had a 400 foot site distance to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| 500 foot site distance to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| which exceeds the 300 foot site distance requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| per the Knox County policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| Jim Snowden commented in your staff review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| that a safety concern is not at present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| Knox County does not have a safety concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| I am arranging a meeting next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| with the Area 6 County Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6140)|

| 1:42:28| and Public Works to discuss improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| on North Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| I've met with all the adjacent homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| and that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| They don't all agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| I do not blame them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| I live rurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| I know what it's like to have a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| coming in behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| I have told every one of those existing homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| I will meet with them upon concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| to go over how we can provide additional buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| to ensure the less of burden placed upon them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| Yeah, I just wanted to speak a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| to the road concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| As part of this traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| that was specifically mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| that the location, I'll read it verbatim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| says the initial review of the traffic crash data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| adjacent to the proposed site on North Campbell Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| does not indicate any road or safety issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| at the proposed site access location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| It also goes further on to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| I guess, there was a study done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| based on crash data from 2012 to 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| And it's a two-mile stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| And this particular segment ranked very low on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| It was 114 out of 554.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| I guess, furthermore, if zoning's approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| and we go to concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| a more detailed traffic impact study will be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| Saying that, I will happily answer any questions I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| Chair will recognize Commissioner Robb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| Thank you, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| I think I'm looking at the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| I'm looking at page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| No, I am looking at slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| And I think we said a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| that where staff recommendations say 1.93| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| and they're asking for 3.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| Is that correct, what I'm seeing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| You know, one of the things we have to keep in mind there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| is the county has not accepted that as a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| It's just simply a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| And while I agree it's a good guideline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| but I don't think that's the only thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| we should use to determine what density should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| And I'd like to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| but I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| I know there's four other people who want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| So I'll hog off on that for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| I think that what we're looking at right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| as a commission is actually two different concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| One is the impact and appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| of the sector plan and rezone that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| And the other is the overall continued growth of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6346)|
| 1:45:54| and whether or not the road system is adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6354)|
| 1:46:02| I'm afraid that the list of rezones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| that have been approved over the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| only further cements the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| that the road system is not keeping up with the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| I did want to ask staff a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| about the Hardin Valley mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| Specifically the North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| I've looked at it a couple of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| and I've read the traffic report attached to this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| And it's not, two things are not clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| One is whether the traffic report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| included impacts of development that has been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| and is either underway or about to go underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| And two, whether the mobility plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| actually addresses the entire lanes of North Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| And I couldn't figure out when improvements would be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| So I would like to address my first question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| regarding the traffic study to the applicants engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| and then the second to our transportation planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| Mr. Sharp, would you like to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6431)|
| 1:47:18| to Commissioner Korbelik's comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| I'm sorry, what was the question about the traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| In your traffic study, when you're looking at existing levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6444)|
| 1:47:32| did you look, did you include anticipated development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| or development that's currently underway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Did you include all development that's been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| but perhaps not yet fully developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Well, at this stage, it's a traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| which is a less intense study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| So I can't answer that specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| but I do know that those criteria will be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| for a full-blown traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| that would come at concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| Okay, and the second question to the mobility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| Hardin Valley mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| I wasn't clear North Campbell Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| as an entire road is going to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6493)|
| 1:48:20| And I'm not 100% sure with that either, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| I know that's something that Knox County has been developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| so that may be worth asking county staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| I'm sorry, that's what I meant to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| I think this is a road that has some regional significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| And I'm going to defer to Jim Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| if he's still available to talk about the timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| Sure, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| Yeah, Commissioner Corbett, I appreciate your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| We did, as part of the mobility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| did kind of focus in on Campbell Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| from Black Road North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| which was kind of just encapsulating the county portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| However, since that time, much to Amy's comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| about the regional significance of the roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| we know it's not in anyone's best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| to just improve our portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| and then terminate it there at the town limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| So I've worked with Daryl Smith and David Smoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| at the Town of Farragut to try to have a joint application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| for the Transportation Planning Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| to have a project that would actually take Campbell Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| from Hardin Valley all the way to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| And we're putting that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| into the mobility plan now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| and hope to obtain federal funds within the next few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| to start the design of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| So it's still a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| It is, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| Even if the county were to undertake the project itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| like our Chaud Road project, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| that project has took almost 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| So a project of this size and scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| regardless of the funding mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| is unfortunately just a longer process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| than any of us would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| I'd like to suggest then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| that when we're looking at the change in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| I'm pulling down the staff report right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| that there has to be a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| Because substantially changed or changing conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| I would submit for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| that the new wastewater treatment facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6637)|
| 1:50:41| is not an adequate substantial change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| because the infrastructure that's most directly impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| is the road network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| So I'm not sure that that criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| is met in a sector plan request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| I just wanna add that I agree with the staff's assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| and would certainly support their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6670)|
| 1:51:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6675)|
| 1:51:15| And just wanna address a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| I know it was mentioned in the opposition comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| that I did ask about the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| And the reason I asked is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| I don't care which sector of our county that you look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| they are all growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| whether it be East, North, West, or South,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| the entire county is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| And anyone trying to stand in that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| is like trying to stop a freight train with your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| Growth is coming to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| So that comment was more just wanting to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| that what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| is getting back to our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| getting back to the county officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| because it is gonna require some significant improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| However, how they get the money to do those improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| are through property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Property taxes, a facility like this will provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| They also receive sales tax revenue from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| of 70 cents of every dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| So everything that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| whether it be in the county or city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| indirectly helps the school system with more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| So I just wanna make sure that that was clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| because when I asked that question in agenda the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| it's just making sure that we're having the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| as part of our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| looking at the holistic view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| of how the county is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| And if you look at the ECD report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| as I mentioned a couple of meetings ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| our area is projected to grow in the next 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| by almost a quarter of a million people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| That is a tremendous amount of growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| coming to the East Tennessee region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| And it's gonna strain our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| And I know Jim Snowden and his team are working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| So I wanted to put that into a bigger context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| than just that one comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| that was made the other day in the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| because we've got to start looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| at a holistic approach to everything in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| And it's gonna strain a lot of things for us to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| But as people move into the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| they're paying more in gas taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Those gas taxes pay for the roads to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| So everything builds on itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| so that we can get more of our infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| up to where it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| and trying to get people to move to another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| It only hurts Knox County in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6795)|
| 1:53:16| So I'm gonna defer now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| I think to Commissioner Roth who's got a motion to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| So I just wanted to make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| to kind of frame my comments the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| that just make sure they're not taken out of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| Chair will recognize Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| And Eddie, thank you for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| I think that makes perfect sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| And people are moving to this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| and actually moving in this Heartland Valley area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| And I'll submit to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| I don't think there's anywhere in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| where you could put a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| where somebody didn't have a problem with the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| And I think we've heard from traffic engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| that this development wouldn't cause an undue hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| on the roads that are there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| And I think it's necessary that we listen to those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| If they said, yeah, it did cause a problem for the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| and traffic problem for the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| then we would have to consider that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| But I think we have to consider those professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| more talking about traffic impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| And based on all that, I'm gonna make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| We approve the Northwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| the revision of the sector plan per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| And Eddie Smith, I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| Chair recognizes Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| Yes, I'd like to enter into discussion on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| I'll share with the commissioners and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| that I would personally feel a lot happier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| with the rate of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| and the struggle of our infrastructure to keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| if we could indeed have a current general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| and a current review of our growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| But at a minimum, an update of the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| which is, I don't know, 15, 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| Because then we actually can tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| where the phasing for improvement should occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| and match that with a demand for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| and make the community understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| that we are sympathetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| and that we have a logical plan that we're following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| I did wanna take an opportunity to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| on the next vote that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| Just to say that if we do approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| I do agree with the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| Even though the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| is just voluntary in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| I do think that it is very useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| And I think the recommendation of 1.9 free dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| in this per acre is appropriate when we get to that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6971)|
| 1:56:11| And I just wanna echo Commissioner Korbelix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| I think it's time that we take a serious look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| at the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| It is severely out of date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| So I don't know if that's us having a letter sent to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| and that's a topic for another discussion off of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| But if it's a letter we send to both the city, county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| as well as County of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| I think that plan is in desperate need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| Based on the growth we're seeing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| how fast it's going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| that that entire plan gets updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| so that we've got something modern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| that's not almost as old as I am at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7004)|

| 2:00:42| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7246)|
| 2:00:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| I see no one else signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| So Mr. Mullins, you may continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| We agree with staff's recommendation and would urge the approval for the Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| and for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| We were before the TTCDA on Monday and obtained our Certificate of Appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7267)|
| 2:01:14| There was one comment, I believe, from Mr. Kevin Murphy on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7274)|
| 2:01:21| with concerns about potentially losing a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| And I want to be clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| There was some questions at the TTCDA about the park as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| The northern half of that property is where the county's ball fields are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7289)|
| 2:01:37| There's no intent to change the use of the northern part of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7297)|
| 2:01:43| It is still under lease with Knox County and shall continue to be under lease indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7303)|
| 2:01:50| We're looking at marketing and potentially selling the southern half of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7310)|
| 2:01:56| and believe that the OB zoning provides us more flexibility right now to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7316)|
| 2:02:05| do something with that property and potentially sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| So we're not trying to do anything with the park and the ball fields to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| And I understand that may be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| So I want to be very clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| Other than that, we appreciate staff's analysis on this and we would ask that you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7338)|
| 2:02:24| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7344)|

| 2:05:52| The next item is number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7552)|
| 2:05:57| The applicant is BWI ETN LLC doing business as Blue Water Industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7557)|
| 2:06:04| Properties located along Asbury Road and Bond Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| Applicant is seeking the East County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| from Mining, Light, Industrial, and General Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| and Hillside Protection to Light, Industrial, and Hillside Protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| Rezoning from Agricultural and General Business to Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| Staff recommendation is to amend the East County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| to Light, Industrial, and Hillside Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| and approve rezoning of the property to Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| Is Mr. Hill, Hillison, Walt Hillis, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| Actually, Chair Phillips, it's me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| I'm going to be representing the applicant on this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7609)|
| 2:06:49| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| Would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| Would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| I know there was a comment on the website in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| and I wanted to maybe clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| The opposition, at least in the public comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| seemed to be seeking a desire to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| the existing Light, Industrial zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| The zoning designations that we're seeking to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| are the General Commercial and the Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| and change the sector plan to Light, Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| and then to Industrial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| which is consistent with the existing zoning in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| There's not really any Light, Industrial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| anywhere in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| All of it is Industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| There is the more intensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7660)|
| 2:07:45| Heavy Industrial Mining sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| that covers a good portion of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| and in addition to the General Commercial sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| and that is all getting changed to Light, Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7675)|
| 2:08:00| The applicant only requested that the commercial portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| of the sector plan be changed to Light, Industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| but the staff's recommendation is to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| all of the sector plan to the Light, Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| Much of that covers the HIM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| and we don't really have an objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| Right now, there's no specific plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| to expand the operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7707)|
| 2:08:28| or to present a plan of operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| for expanding the existing mining and quarrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| This is really just buffer property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| to the existing operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| At some point that may or may not change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| but the sector plan allows for the Industrial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| whether it's Light, Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| or the Heavy Industrial Mining designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| which would allow the ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| there to be a plan of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| So, I'll listen to what the opposition may say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| and be glad to answer any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| but we agree with staff's analysis on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| and would request the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| and the rezoning for staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| You have roughly two minutes and 50 seconds left for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| Staff will, I mean, I'll recognize Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| On this one, I listened to a lot of discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| in the county about business parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| the need for industrial land and such like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| So, primary concern and interest that we had here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| is looking at this is to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| is thinking about if this did turn to Heavy Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| and then into property that would be turned into quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| that is a use that then permanently consumes that land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| and makes it unusable for future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| So, it's a consideration for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| I know that there is a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| for some quarry and mining in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| There's also, I hear it all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7807)|
| 2:10:10| that we need more and more land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| for light industrial and for business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7811)|
| 2:10:15| So, before improving Heavy Industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| which would likely end up eventually becoming a mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| and a quarry consuming the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| then I'd encourage you to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| that's permanent versus light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| and distribution office, manufacturing, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| allows that land to be used in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| So, that's a general land use planning question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| that we just add as you balance the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| and the desires and future needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| of the county going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7846)|
| 2:10:50| The other consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| I think there's one other speaker signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7851)|
| 2:10:54| Ashley Helton, who she just texted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| She did get on the Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| Yeah, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7858)|
| 2:10:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| I wanna tee up one thing too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7860)|
| 2:11:03| There's also, it's not mentioned anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| but I'm a former president of the Board of Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| And I think it's important that if there's a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| that's on the National Register of Historic Places nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| that it be identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| Asbury United Methodist Church was built in 1898.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7879)|
| 2:11:24| And in 1996, Ann Bennett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| who is a former staff person and NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| Ann actually did the nomination to list Asbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| on the National Register of Historic Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| So, I think that's important to consider potential impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| of a historic resource as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7901)|
| 2:11:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| I'll recognize Ms. Helton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7906)|
| 2:11:47| This is Ashley Helton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| I am the pastor at Asbury United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| And as Kevin said, he was teamed me up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| But our concern, we really want it to be on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| for just expressing our concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| and really wanting to pour our energy into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| if this goes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| making sure that we are setting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| whatever is going to happen at the quarry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| to make sure that it doesn't negatively affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7928)|
| 2:12:11| the space of our church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7931)|
| 2:12:12| which as Kevin mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| is on the National Historic Registry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| We already deal with a lot being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| in the industrial complex area and the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| as more and more industry has moved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| more houses and residents have moved out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| The church building continues to just take hits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| time after time from new industry coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| We saw it last year with the asphalt company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| and they still haven't followed through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| with all of the things that they're supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| like erecting trees and planning barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-201112?start=7960)|
