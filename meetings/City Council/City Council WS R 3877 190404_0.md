| 0:00:30| Thank you all for your patience. I will now call this meeting to order and ask Councilwoman Stephanie Welsh to lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=30)|
| 0:00:40| Please face the flag and prepare to pledge. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=40)|
| 0:01:00| Thank you. Mr. Johnson, if you would call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| Councilman Kampen? Here. Councilwoman McKenzie? Here. Councilman Ryder? Here. Councilman Roberto? Here. Vice Mayor Saunders? Here. Councilwoman Singh-Perez? Here. Councilman Starr? Here. Councilman Wallace? Here. Councilwoman Welch? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=65)|
| 0:01:18| Okay, thank you. We do have a quorum, although that is not necessary for this meeting. I will say that Ms. Singh-Perez has had a death in the family and there's a fair chance that she will not be able to make it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=78)|
| 0:01:33| Okay, so here we are in the third workshop since we received this fourth draft from MPC, and the fifth workshop total that the City Council has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=93)|
| 0:01:46| So I will now call on Gerald Green to begin whatever presentation and introduce the guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| Thank you, Vice Mayor Saunders, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| First, I'd like to thank all the partners we've had throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| One of the outstanding results of this effort has been creating partnerships with others in the community, from the Knoxville area Urban League, Central Hispano, and SEED,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=120)|
| 0:02:13| who helped us with the outreach to usually underrepresented parties in the community, to the Office of Neighborhoods, who helped us with overall community outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=133)|
| 0:02:23| to the Knoxville area Chamber of Commerce, who helped with outreach and meetings, the Knoxville area Association of Realtors, who assisted with outreach and community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=143)|
| 0:02:34| to the Plans Review and Inspections Department, Peter Ahrens, and the City Law Department, Christina Magrins, who have been a key part of this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=154)|
| 0:02:45| to members of my own staff, primarily Amy Brooks, who has helped shoulder the load throughout this, and most importantly, the community of Knoxville, who received a lot of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=165)|
| 0:02:58| Those comments reflect the diversity of the community, the challenge in finding standards that address everyone's vision for the community, and that work for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=178)|
| 0:03:09| There is no small challenge in trying to meet everyone's expectations when everyone has a different expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| I think that the draft ordinance that you are reviewing, with the changes that are being made now, will address the overall vision for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=197)|
| 0:03:27| and put the city in a good position to be part of the dynamic growth that is occurring in urban areas in the 21st century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| With that, I'll just give an overview of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| Mr. Green, let me make a comment before you get started here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| Tonight, I think it's important that my colleagues, that we pay, obviously, you always pay attention, but as we deal with the various issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=222)|
| 0:03:50| we may have to take some straw votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| Obviously, we cannot vote on anything, but we need to give Mr. Green as much guidance as we possibly can for this final draft that will then go into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=233)|
| 0:04:02| and we will consider in our May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| Anyhow, be aware of that, and if you feel the need to call for a straw vote, if some issue that we're talking about needs to be voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| don't hesitate to bring it up, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Now, Mr. Green, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| First, I'll give a status update, let you know what has occurred since the last workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Then, former Vice Mayor Duane Greve will provide an overview with some assistance on the design charrette and round table conducted by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=263)|
| 0:04:34| East Tennessee Section of the American Institute of Architects and the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| Then, we'll get into code administration with Peter and Christina playing a key role in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| We'll address some of the policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| I sent you some information on those earlier in the day, and then general discussion and questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| Not a lot of discussion by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| I think this is your turn to, as have been the other workshops, to provide your comments and direction and input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| With regard to the status update, a letter was sent to all owners of property in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| notifying them of the effort to update the city's zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| As a result of that, we've received approximately 350 phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| All those phone calls have been answered and responded to as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| Some of them we had to leave messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| There was no answer when we called, but we left messages with direct phone numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| so those individuals could contact us, and some of those for whom we left messages have contacted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=329)|
| 0:05:38| Most callers only wanted an explanation of what was going on, more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| Some had a few questions about the zoning of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| and wanted to ensure that it preserved their existing development opportunities and rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| In all cases, we tried to accomplish that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| One of the more important results of this was getting a better understanding of the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| With that, I can say again that I think the draft zoning code does reflect the vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| and the desires of most of the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| As I mentioned, the East Tennessee section of the American Institute of Architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| and the East Tennessee Community Design Center held a recode testing workshop and a design roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| We continue to receive a few website comments from the recode website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| The comments are really filtering down and nothing new has come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| except there was for a couple of days several comments stating that mixed-use buildings violated ADA standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| They do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| If they did, downtown would be in violation of ADA standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| We're working on revisions to the draft code to create a final draft now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| We anticipate that final draft being available at the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| We're also continuing to revise the draft zoning map to create a final draft zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| that will be available at the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| With that, I'd like to introduce Vice Mayor Duane Greve, who will speak about the design charrette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=426)|
| 0:07:18| Again, I mentioned earlier the partnerships we've been able to form as a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| The partnership with the East Tennessee Community Design Center is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| the Knoxville-Knox County planning has been undergoing for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| We've had several good projects together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| This is another example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Getting the East Tennessee section of the American Institute of Architects involved in the effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| was a stroke of good fortune for us because they were able to give us a perspective on the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| that we would not have otherwise had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| I appreciate the efforts of those two groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| Council, each one of us has a copy of what I think Mr. Greve is going to review with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=475)|
| 0:08:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| You're on, Mr. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| I just want to say that it's enjoyable being in this seat versus where I was for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| I appreciate being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| I also want to thank, like Mr. Vice Mayor said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=500)|
| 0:08:26| you folks have a copy of a 40-page report that the Design Center and the AIA put together for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=506)|
| 0:08:34| in regards to the charrette as well as the roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| But I do want to start by thanking a number of folks who were involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| both with the design charrette and the standard roundtable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| We want to thank Gerald Green and Amy Brooks from the Knoxville-Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| who participated throughout our endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| Also with AIA East Tennessee, we want to thank Richard Foster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| who's going to be making a presentation here shortly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| Christina Bowler and Eric Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| and from the Community Design Center, myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| but also Leslie Poise, who is our design studio coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| who actually coordinated and put this thing together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| I want to go into a little bit of detail and tell you about how we got to where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| and what the schedule was on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| In the fall of 2018, both the AIA East Tennessee and the East Tennessee Community Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| discussed among themselves the opportunity to test the proposed code that was coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| They then met after deciding that this would be a good situation for both these organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| to be involved in this and to let the community, as well as council in the city, know how the codes worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| They then met with the Knoxville-Knox County Planning on how to best test the recode Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| in the real-world scenario and report back its conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| I want to stress that this was totally a volunteer and public effort led by these three organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| This academic exercise would test the code within six actual locations in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| by using the recode draft number four and the zoning map number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| The public provided two sites to consider for review for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| As far as how we then put it together, as I mentioned to you earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| you have a report that was, I think, given to you yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| Leslie Poise, who is AIA and also our studio design director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=633)|
| 0:10:39| will discuss the results of the charrette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| Following the charrette, a design standards roundtable was convened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| to examine the proposed recode design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| and those were the same folks that worked with the charrette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| Richard Foster, who I mentioned, past president of AIA, will discuss those findings shortly also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| What happened was we met on February 1, 2019, from noon until 7 at the Public Works building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| The attendees were architects, developers, landscape architects, and UT architectural students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| The process was to examine the six predetermined city of Knoxville sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| in order to evaluate and develop designs based on the proposed recode zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| We're going to discuss that and the major conclusions of each one of those in just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| We want to thank the 50 volunteers who donated over 350 hours to participate in this charrette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| We had, as I mentioned, we had the architects, landscape architects, developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| These folks were invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| They all showed up, and as I mentioned, a lot of time and effort was put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| The public was then invited at the end of the charrette| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| to see the results of the six sites that were looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| Then the design center, we spent over 100 hours preparing the full recode report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| and today will be a brief overview of the compiled findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| City Council, as I mentioned, received the full recode report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| and it will be available to the public on the recode in the design center website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| I also want to mention that the design center approves, in theory, the major content of the proposed code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=735)|
| 0:12:23| but we realize that there are areas that need further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| We do recommend that the stakeholders review committee, I think it has been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| that stays in effect for two years in order to really tweak the code once it's put into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| So we would, as the design center, we would recommend that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| Also, then, what I'd like to do now is to go ahead and turn it over to Leslie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| who is going to discuss the six sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| Ms. Fawaz, when you begin your presentation, if you would give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Hi, I'm Leslie Fawaz, studio director at the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| My address is 1608 Botsford Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=784)|
| 0:13:15| I want to emphasize the recode charrette goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| We wanted to test the recode draft four and zoning map three at Knoxville locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| They were north, south, east, west, and downtown edge conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| We wanted to explore how recode shapes future development and assess recode's content, format, and usability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=810)|
| 0:13:40| The first site we looked at, you will see, is Fifth Avenue and Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| It's near where Knoxville Historic High School is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| The findings from the group that met, we had about six participants per group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| We had architects, developers, and the students all spread out with each zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| What their comments were were that downtown edge zone is helpful for restoring density near the city core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| There should be an overlay for potential historic structures and for recommended transit-oriented development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| The developers of the group suggested additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| This zone allowed for on-street parking, but they thought for usable businesses that additional parking would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=853)|
| 0:14:21| The next study area that we looked at was in west, and it was Bearden at Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| New zones were very helpful in transitioning from lower to higher intensity uses and more walkable communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| but parking requirements were difficult to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| The design included street-facing, mixed-use developments of two- and three-stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| and transitioning to four-, six-, and ten-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=883)|
| 0:14:51| The next area we looked at was Park Ridge at First Creek, and this site was given to us by the community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| This is looking at the standard knitting mill site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| They suggested parking reductions should be allowed at preferred sites for large buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| like the standard knitting mill, that have potential to become a transit-oriented development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| Consider shared parking at park-adjacent sites and allowable building heights to be more contextual based on existing structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=911)|
| 0:15:24| The next site was Burlington in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| The site was conducive for allowing lower-to-higher intensity transitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| New developments would be aided by more organized on-street parking in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| which could help mitigate some of the parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| A change from CG to CN zones along small main streets, like Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, seemed more appropriate for this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=941)|
| 0:15:55| We also looked at Chapman Highway at Moody Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| Pushing the new development to the street edge created large areas of asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| which in turn created the need for more green spaces to separate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| Current RN, or Residential Zone 5, is well-placed, but would be better suited as a swath of zones from RN-7 to RN-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=968)|
| 0:16:18| in order to aid in transitions of intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| And then the final site in North was Merchant Drive at Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| This site was developed using traditional town-center approach, with a central green common space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| Due to the size of the site, it could be changed into a walkable and transit-friendly community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| CH-1 zones need to address the number of and distance between entrances and exits of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| This would improve walkability in this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| And that's it for the sites, and then we had general conclusions to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| They were to add transition zones between areas of high-intensity and low-intensity development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| There are parcels that seem out of place with their proposed zoning, and need to be rezoned to create better transitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1023)|
| 0:17:11| Consideration needs to be given to the future development of certain building types when they are zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| such as places of worship, considering that they might be rezoned to different functions in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| The proposed map is inconsistent in some areas with what the code wishes to accomplish in terms of transitions and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| CG-3 commercial zones need to be considered in terms of context and transitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| And the commercial neighborhood zone is one that was considered to be underutilized in the current map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1057)|
| 0:17:46| So following the charrette, the architects determined a need for an in-depth discussion on the recode design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| So there was a roundtable design standards meeting held February 28th, and Richard Foster is now going to talk about those findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1072)|
| 0:18:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Mr. Foster, if you would come to the mic and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Richard Foster, 301 Cheshire Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| As Leslie said, following the initial charrette, a second workshop was held to specifically look at the design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1094)|
| 0:18:23| material restrictions, and design review process as outlined in the current draft of the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| We began the afternoon with a recap from Amy Brooks of the project vision to promote investment in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1110)|
| 0:18:43| while protecting what makes our city great, and to do that with a zoning code that is easier to use and administer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1123)|
| 0:18:51| one that is clear, predictable, and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| Given that vision and goals of the recode process, architects and designers divided into teams to tackle specific districts in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1135)|
| 0:19:05| The general consensus of this effort was overall positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| It promotes a more progressive approach to the growth of the city while trying to protect existing conditions worth protecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| Overall, the usability of the code seems improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| That said, out of the evaluation came a number of recommendations for ways that the proposed code could be further refined and clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1162)|
| 0:19:31| In interest of time, I will not get into the specifics of all the recommendations here, but I want to try to hit some of the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| We found that with material restrictions, this was a challenging topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| because as one of our participants said, any good material can be used badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| Any restricted material could be used well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| So we certainly recommend this is an area worth further study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Where there are material restrictions, we would recommend more specificity to the intent of the restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| perhaps including specific examples of poor usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| We would also recommend more specificity as to material definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| For example, plastic is a fairly broad term that could be used to apply to anything from petroleum-based products to concrete to solid surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1211)|
| 0:20:22| or any other number of polymer-type materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| Design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Elements like the new chart in the code go a long way to improving usability and clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| We recommend coordination of design standard language with other codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| For instance, references to percentage of glazing on façade should be coordinated with, or perhaps just referenced, sections of the energy code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1241)|
| 0:20:51| There are instances where material restrictions can simply be addressed by allowable materials in the IBC fire restriction districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1251)|
| 0:21:01| And height limitations can be governed by the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| Ensuring consistency between codes can go a long way to making the zoning ordinance easier to understand and administer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| Like the material restriction section, there are a number of places where the code can be strengthened with more specific language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| Words like transparency or repetition can sometimes be confusing or have multiple meanings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| We would further recommend overall clarity of intent with regards to many of the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| As we reviewed the document, there were a number of instances that were difficult to evaluate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| such as no blank walls larger than 30 feet, without clear understanding or context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| And I'll come back to this point in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| There are a number of graphic illustrations in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| In many ways, these diagrams do a nice job in clearly illustrating the meaning of the design standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1312)|
| 0:22:00| One area of concern is the degree to which these illustrations might start to dictate a style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| Some cities, like Charleston or Santa Barbara, have very consistent architectural styles throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| But I think we all agree that Knoxville likes diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Quality, but diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| We would recommend adapting the graphics to be less leading towards what may be assumed to be a preferred style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1339)|
| 0:22:29| The next recommendation is a fairly big recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| As I mentioned earlier, there were several instances, as we went through the evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| where the lack of intent made interpretation or evaluation difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| We would recommend adding a section to the code that outlines the code's guiding principles when it comes to design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| Design standards, as they currently exist in the code, outline what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| They do not describe the purpose or intent of the code, the why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| We believe that this section of guiding design principles should be the preface to all of the design standards in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| What I'm illustrating here is an example of such design principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| These were recently developed for the city of New York City, specifically for quality, affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| But these principles, in many ways, are universally agreed upon as good design strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| Design 101, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| I'm going to highlight just a couple of these, because I think they're relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| The first one is materiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| If you look at the bold section, a couple of these points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| consider materials that complement rather than strictly match adjacent buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| Consider using combination of materials to help articulate the facade, enhance massing, and distinguish programs at the interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1422)|
| 0:23:53| Consider materials with low environmental impact that are easily maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| And consider the life expectancy of buildings and how materials selected will change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| In many ways, the design standards aim to kind of talk to some of these principles in a what-to-do sort of fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1445)|
| 0:24:14| We think it would be valuable to specifically put these principles in if these are the underlying goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1454)|
| 0:24:22| This next one is talking about ground floor condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| Consider a welcoming arrival threshold with a space designed for residents to gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| Consider large windows to promote visual connections between the ground floor activity and the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| You get the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| I'm not going to read through all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| But overall, principles that really kind of guide why we are putting this code in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| and kind of govern the types of places that we want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| It's important to remember that design standards and material restrictions, along with the review process, were developed for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| In essence, it's to create a floor for minimally acceptable design standard for important corridors in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1501)|
| 0:25:08| and to create a review process that is manageable, transparent, and consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| All of these are good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| However, what happens oftentimes with a prescriptive design standard is that you not only create a floor for acceptable design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1515)|
| 0:25:24| but you also create a ceiling that could prevent outstanding design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1524)|
| 0:25:33| The big question is, how do you safeguard the design of the city against some agreed-upon idea of bad design without limiting greatness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| And I know we've had a data process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| In fact, I know that given the project vision and goals, promoting greatness is the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| The proposed review process outlined in the draft code would have projects subjected to design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| to be reviewed by the city codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| For the sake of consistency and efficiency, this process would be very prescriptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| It is effectively a series of checkboxes intended to be quantifiable and measurable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| and to establish a minimum level of design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| We recognize the need for this sort of kind of fast-track process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| and with clear standards, there will be many projects for which this will work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| However, we would strongly recommend the option of an alternative design approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| This illustration highlights a dual-path approach with which is referred to as a prescriptive path and a performance path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1593)|
| 0:26:43| The prescriptive path on top is what is currently outlined in the draft code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| that would run through design standards material restrictions to be administered through the city codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| We would propose an alternative performance path that would give project teams the option of avoiding design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| and instead design to meet the design principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| Those projects would be reviewed by the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| We believe that with qualified staff that the planning department could review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| and approve most projects within the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| For projects that may require further review, we would propose that they may be reviewed by a design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1637)|
| 0:27:25| When the downtown design review board was established, downtown was in a more delicate state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| I think most of us would agree that having the board in place has helped to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| high quality of growth and development that our city center has seen in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| Arguably, we are now at a point in the city's development where it is the major corridors leading into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| that is experiencing a lot of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Simply allowing the existing design review board to expand its purview to include these corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| when projects need more review than the city planning can handle would be one way to accomplish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Thank you very much for the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| I hope the presentation is available on the planning commission's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| It will be on the RECODE website tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Yeah, because of the great comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| As well as a copy of the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| And then, Mr. Grieve, I think what I heard, and counsel, if you have any questions, we can certainly pose them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| that overall, you're in general agreement with the RECODE process as it's progressed so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| The design center is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| With the caveat that we have the two-year where the stakeholders continue to participate and work on the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| Got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Mr. Foster, did I hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| AIA East Tennessee has the same sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Any questions from my colleagues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| So, I'm going to assume that Director Green, you had seen this presentation before we had today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| So, there's kind of a different approach, maybe, to some of the things that were suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| I understand where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| So, my question is, are these things that you guys are reviewing and consider implementing into an additional draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1754)|
| 0:29:22| And from my perspective, this is new information for us and for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| and how that works out timeframe-wise for us to consider and digest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| and think about the consequences, unintended or otherwise, positive, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| And I don't see it as a major change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| The change would be that we provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| The staff recommendation is that we implement the proposed two-path design review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| The prescriptive would remain the design standards we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| The process is outlined in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| There would be the option of the performance review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| And this has been discussed by the planning committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| The options for doing this have been discussed from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| How do we improve design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Is it prescriptive or performance-based?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| We went initially with the prescriptive because it was that checklist that was considered to be faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| With plans review and inspections, reviewing the projects, we felt that the prescriptive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| here are the standards, you either meet them or don't, was the better approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| The performance review, having some guiding principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| and the Knoxville-Knox County planning staff reviewing those with the option of the design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| It's something that could be implemented with that significant additional work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| I think it's fairly easy to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| Given the discussions I've had with Mr. Foster and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| we feel maybe 10% of the projects that come through the city would go through that performance-based review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1856)|
| 0:31:04| 90% would likely take the prescriptive and the faster route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| This would provide an option as opposed to requesting a variance from the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Are there any other questions or comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you all very much for the efforts you put into getting this charrette together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| and walking through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I think this has been very valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| And all of my colleagues have a copy of this, so I think we can peruse that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| But thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Mr. Green, we'll move on to codes administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1900)|
| 0:31:51| It's showing on my computer, but it's not showing on your screen, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1911)|
| 0:32:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| I apologize for me seeing something different than you're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| But I'm going to try to close out the PowerPoint presentation and reopen mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1934)|
| 0:32:30| Here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Okay, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| And I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| With the code administration, as I stated earlier, plans review and inspections of the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1957)|
| 0:32:46| has delegated the authority for administration of the zoning code and the enforcement of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| Those provisions for enforcement and administration are largely found in Articles 14 and 18 of the proposed code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1972)|
| 0:33:01| A lot of the processes are the same as we have in the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1981)|
| 0:33:09| We're working to make that section of the code consistent with each provision having the same format| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| so that it's easier to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| That will be in the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Nothing in the process changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| The organization of the description of those processes changes somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| The city law department is also heavily involved in the administration of the code, providing input throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| I'll let Mr. Ahrens provide additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| As the code administrator, he's the one who will be charged with the day-to-day operation of the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2016)|
| 0:33:48| Mr. Ahrens, I think that means he wants you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| And I gave him warning the day before yesterday, or Monday, that this would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| So let's look a surprise on his face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| We've become very close friends through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2039)|
| 0:34:07| We've been reviewing it to make sure that we can enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| Basically, we think that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| Would you like to answer any questions that you have about enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| Well, counsel, it may be best if Mr. Green completes his total presentation, and then we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2062)|
| 0:34:30| I'm sure there are questions here, and I think I know where some of them may come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2070)|
| 0:34:46| Let me try this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2086)|
| 0:34:56| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Oh, okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Am I interrupting your train of thought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| So you just clarified something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| So Mr. Ahrens, who is the chief building inspector, is that your title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| So he's the zoning administrator that's referred to in Article 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| So just one point of note is that in the current zoning code, it's the building official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| And so are we defining or clarifying that change in the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2129)|
| 0:35:40| I think it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| If I look at Article 15, Section 642 refers to the Department of Plans, Review, and Inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| officials and charges the building official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| So I think that's one of the points of confusion with some stuff is trying to go back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2157)|
| 0:36:05| where we have used a certain lingo and a certain set of vocabulary and verbiage since 1963,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2165)|
| 0:36:15| and we're changing and trying to make sure all the definitions get changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2175)|
| 0:36:24| And one concern that I have, maybe not about that precisely, but about multiple things throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| is when we change definitions, we change the words that define something, is that our building community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| and community and we've litigated with certain words, certain definitions and organization since 1963.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2198)|
| 0:36:49| And so we'll start with this one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| So we're changing building official to zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| For the purposes of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Mr. Ahrens, what is your title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| My title is the Director of Plans, Review, and Building Inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| and I serve the function of zoning administrator and building official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| That's in your job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| But not necessarily in our charter that describes it differently and refers to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| I'll pull up the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| I am in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| I'm the Director of Plans, Review, and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| But now you're also the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| I've been the zoning administrator since I was hired on in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| I think some of our challenges, and we do need to define those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| but we're calling different things what they are now, not what they may have been in 1963.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| It's how they were referred to in 2019 and likely in 2020 and 2021 and 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| And bringing those definitions up to date is certainly something we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| But because something was termed something in 1963 and it's no longer called that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| to be honest, I didn't know what a chief building official was when I came to work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| I knew Peter quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| I knew him as the Director of Plans, Review, and Inspections and the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| I think our challenge is, as you said, to bring those definitions up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| and make sure that we cross-reference them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| I can read you what our charter says, Section 2-341.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2313)|
| 0:38:40| Actually, 342, the functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| The Department of Plans, Review, and Inspections shall be responsible for facilitating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| and issuing all permits for construction required by the provisions of the electrical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| mechanical, gas, plumbing, building, and zoning codes of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| and for inspecting all work performed pursuant to the issuance of such permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| Okay, that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Tell me again the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Section 2-342.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| And what article?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Article 2, Departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| Kind of piggybacking on that, there is an area or there's a committee that has a lot of responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2361)|
| 0:39:32| and that's the Administrative Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| You can find that on page 14-3 and on 14-16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| And when I reviewed this, I wanted you to maybe make a comment on how this Administrative Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2384)|
| 0:39:53| and its powers might be different than what we have currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| But then also, I was a little concerned when looking through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| and seeing that it didn't look like there were regular meetings or public meetings with a public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| And I just wanted us to have a chance to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Right now, there's an Administrative Review Committee that's regulating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| that manages the zoning enforcement for the South Waterfront District and the Cumberland District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| And so it is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| And, no, they're not public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| They're as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| When somebody makes an application, we do our very best to work with our customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| and get review comments back to them quickly so that they can proceed with their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| So it's only for those two districts now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| It wouldn't be citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| And that's how it's spelled out in section 14.8 on page 14-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| And we'll get into some specifics here going through the evening, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| But there's a lot of pretty critical things that we'll, I think, review tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| that the Administrative Review Committee does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| And giving some thought to whether or not we should have public notice and public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| I think, is something we should look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Just to clarify, the Administrative Review Committee currently and as proposed in this draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| will only apply to the two form-based districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Or is their authority expanding beyond that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| It will apply to those two districts for the zoning compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| And if there is an alternative landscape proposal, they will review that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| And that's where currently we would rely heavily on our urban forester to provide input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| as well as the planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| But the intention under RECODE is not to expand their role for zoning oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| outside of those two districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| And so just to make sure that I understand, in those two districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| that process will remain intact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| We anticipate that process to remain exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| For, we're not planning on changing anything in those two districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| Not ever, but not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| As part of RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Not right now, as part of RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Not ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Not ever, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| So, I just want to be very clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| Because those two districts have their own documents currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| Those documents in total will be incorporated into the next draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| including the administrative section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| It's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| So, the administrative section will also, not just the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| but the administration of the code will be included in total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| At this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| I mean, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| And I think everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| we've already talked about looking at updating that at a different time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| not as part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| So, I guess that confuses me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| because there are items that I had seen where the administrative review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| committee was increasing the time frames for things that were outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| those two districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| That may have been in a previous version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Do you have an example I can take a look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| Let's look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2626)|
| 0:43:57| On.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2637)|
| 0:44:12| On page 1012, temporary sales and display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| Doesn't it say the administrative review committee may increase the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| frames?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| 10-12, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| Which item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| It would be under U, outdoor sales and display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2679)|
| 0:44:53| I know I saw that somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| This is all related to the Cumberland Avenue district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| So, I think the Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| So, these items are only in those districts, not citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| The administrative review committee, or ARC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| has those responsibilities in the forum districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| but not in the remainder of the zoning districts in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2718)|
| 0:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| Is everybody ready to move on to policy issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| We have a draft here that Mr. Green provided us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| I guess could you just sum up the administrative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| the differences between the current code and the new code in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| For the administrative review committee or in total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| In total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| In total, there's fewer planned districts that would be going straight to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2756)|
| 0:46:04| planning department for review and developing a development plan or master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| That's being replaced by design standards in the CG and in various zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2772)|
| 0:46:21| Administratively, there is a planned development option for any zone where if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| somebody has a more creative idea, they can go directly to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| and I think it's very similar to what Mr. Green was proposing with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| second path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| But that's planned development is a new administrative option for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| creative development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| Peter is correct that in trying to achieve one of the goals set out early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| in this process in making the development process clearer and more consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| and more transparent, we've gone from more, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| more open-ended, subjective with the planned districts to more prescriptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| for the standard to set forth a faster review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| less involvement by the planning commission and the planning staff in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| review and approval of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| That's the biggest change in terms of day-to-day administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| Very little has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| What about the rezoning process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| The rezoning process remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| The basic process is set forth in state legislation and the code mirrors that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| For rezoning, the initial request is heard by the planning commission with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| the recommendations provided by the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| Then the recommendation of the planning commission comes to the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| for final action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| And for special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Those that are special uses would go before the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| similar to the use on review process currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| So no major changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| The biggest change is there are fewer special uses than there are proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| than there are currently used on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| Before we move forward, I think Mr. Frost would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| This is about a follow-up on Councilmember Roberto's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| I remembered what he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| If you turn to page 9-33, under both G4C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2916)|
| 0:48:46| temporary outdoor entertainment, which actually begins on the previous page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| G4C says the administrative review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| upon review of the temporary use permit, may increase these time frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| And then you have similar language under H, temporary outdoor sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| which can be found under Part 4C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| And there's a chance it might be on the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| Under L10, Part 4, references the administrative review committee as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| There might be some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| And keep in mind that the draft you're reading now came out in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| and we've heard these comments from this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| We've made those, proposed those revisions and directed the consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| In fact, they have sent a preliminary draft that has changed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| and delegated those duties to the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| That's one of the challenges in trying to hold this draft until we get all your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| and have a final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| The comments that you've made and direction that you provided previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| has not been incorporated into a printed draft yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| We heard those comments loud and clear, and those revisions will be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| Some of those comments you will find on the thing you got this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| the email you got this afternoon, comments from Rob Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| So some of that may have already been cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| Is that this policy issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| No, that is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| That is the email to you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| You may not have printed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Well, let's move on, and we do have Councilwoman Welsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| General, this is just maybe a general question or observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| I'm trying to make sure I understand the difference between zoning administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| and zoning interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| And so when I hear those terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| administration seems like a more clear-cut sort of checklist, you know, follow the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3055)|
| 0:51:03| Interpretation would seem to imply a level of expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| or skill that might go beyond administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| It does seem like there has been some transfer of responsibility from the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3073)|
| 0:51:22| from planning to zoning administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| and I'd like to just hear the rationale behind that and sort of what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| The process was not clear in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| Some interpretations were handled by the planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| some by the zoning administrative plans review and inspections department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| resulting in some inconsistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| Peter and I met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Peter met with other staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| Because the current city charter identifies the plans review and inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| and the chief is the zoning administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| that responsibility was turned over to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3123)|
| 0:52:11| I may be kicked for this later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| but this is the only place I'm familiar with that has planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| where the planning staff is not charged with the interpretation of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| Interpretation relies upon the knowledge of the foundation of that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| That foundation is provided by being involved in the planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| the planning policies, the planning documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| which then result in ordinances and amendments to ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| The interpretations are questions about how that ordinance is implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| or how it affects the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| It's interesting that it's the first place I've seen that that responsibility is delegated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| to those who deal more with building than with planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| I think that reflects our cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| I'm not sure why in 1963 the zoning administrator was identified as the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3181)|
| 0:53:09| who at that time was the chief building official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| I'm not sure what the state law is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| but that's consistent throughout Tennessee, which is new to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| Looking at state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| state law is likely so old that most communities didn't have a planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3202)|
| 0:53:30| The states I'm familiar with, their old state law stated that the building official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| was the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| When I took my first job in North Carolina in 1983,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3219)|
| 0:53:47| the state legislation at that time stated that the zoning administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| was the chief building official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| I don't think state legislation does not always keep up with current actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| and activities as does not our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| I think to answer your question, because I'm charged with enforcing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| I think the intent was if I have to enforce it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| I should be able to interpret what I'm enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| And so that's why where it was ambiguous in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| we've made it clear in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| So the pathways that were proposed by AIA that included sort of one path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| that was more administrative in nature and the other that was more interpretive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| in nature, would that – I mean, I'm just – that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| Maybe I misread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| I think that was one, and you read it correctly, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| There was one path that was prescriptive, more clear-cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| and that went to – would go to plans review and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| The other one, which was performance and less clear-cut, came to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| But it was about design standards, not uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| Not use. Okay. Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| All right. Thank you, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Okay. So the – anytime we see administrative review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| it's going to be removed unless it's dealing with Cumberland and South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| All right. So let's go back to that example on page 9-33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| If we substitute replacing zoning administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| that letter C under number 4 would say the zoning administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| upon review of the temporary use permit, may increase these timeframes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| So is there an intent for there to be some kind of public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| or public meeting in which you would make these decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| I'm going to look to see what the current code says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Because I know scattered throughout the current code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| there's a lot of that language that says the zoning –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| or the chief building official zoning administrator can modify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| Okay. Well, while you're looking that up –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| If I could –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Peter, Christina, Amy and I met earlier this week, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| And agreed that there needs to be a blanket statement on temporary use permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| that only one extension for one time period can be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| So that that limits the number of extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| That may address some of the concerns about those time limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| because currently it seems like you have a temporary sales for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| You get a 30-day extension and a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| The amendment we proposed would limit all temporary uses to one extension for one time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| Would all those time periods be the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| No. And if you look at the temporary uses now, they all have different time periods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| because, for example, a farmer's market is a temporary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| Do we want to require them to have a 30-day time limit or a 15-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| and they have one extension so the farmer's market can only operate for one month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| Each temporary use is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| And what we've tried to do is assign a time frame or time period for each use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| that is related to that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Okay. And we can get into this a little bit more later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| but some of the things that I think we'll discuss in certain points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| could be perceived as pretty disruptive to a neighborhood and not having any kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| You and I discussed that earlier, and that's where the zoning administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| does not have to grant a temporary use permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| If in his or her, in the future, review of that request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| the zoning administrator finds that there are impacts that are adverse to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| to the neighborhood, or to the location, there's not adequate infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| not adequate parking, then the temporary use permit can be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| The request can be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| We can't eliminate a temporary use from an area or eliminate a temporary use outright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3494)|
| 0:58:22| because we think it may be disruptive to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| There are times when those temporary uses are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| You and I talked about rummage sales at a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| We eliminate temporary sales in residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| and the church can't have a rummage sale on Saturday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| to raise funds for the missionary efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| That is where we allow the discretion of the zoning administrator to be implemented for the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| If the zoning administrator doesn't do a good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| then that person is offered the opportunity to find another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| Right now, the way the code is set up currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| it basically gives me a blank slate, and anything that is compatible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| they can have a temporary use for a year and renew it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| That's three years of a temporary use that basically just goes through me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| That is a lot of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| We've got one that they're on their second year of a temporary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| but I reached out to not only planning but redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| I reached out to the various departments within the city, engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| to make sure it is compatible with the area and that there was the infrastructure to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| The temporary use in the situation I'm describing gave a new business model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| an opportunity to put their toe in the water to see if it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| They knew right on the front end it's not permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| You've got upwards to three years to make it work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| and then you either make it permanent or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| Conversely, I have no problem and have denied temporary uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| where people come in and they think they've got a great idea and we discuss it and we're like, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| It's not like a temporary use is a blank slate to do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3614)|
| 1:00:22| Maybe after I'm gone, somebody else will make it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| What you're suggesting is with the changes that we're probably going to see in the final draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| there might be more limitations on those extensions than there are currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| Yeah, right now it's pretty wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Okay, so I feel like I'm a little in the murky waters here because I'm like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| I'm not sure if what I'm looking at is what I'm actually talking about because we're in between drafts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| and I'm looking at basically old stuff, so let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| I just want to put out there, and we can discuss it later when we get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| but I just want to say I would hope that a neighborhood's only grievance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| if there's an ongoing nonstop outdoor thing that's disruptive to a neighborhood in the middle of a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| it is fine for a church to have a rummage sale or for someone to have a rummage sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| but we all know of examples where there's perma yard sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| I would hate for a neighborhood's only grievance is to, there needs to be a process to be able to appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| whether it's complain to the codes administrator or whatever and some process of appeal versus having somebody fired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3691)|
| 1:01:39| because the neighborhoods have had to do that before, and that's not a pretty process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| and I see people in the audience that know what I'm talking about, and that's not where people want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| and it's not about, we need to write a code that works for no matter who has the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| This isn't about the individuals and whether we believe you have good judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| If I could, with regard to residential districts, the temporary outdoor sales, there's a restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3719)|
| 1:02:07| Temporary outdoor sales in the residential districts is restricted to those events associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| and conducted by a place of worship or educational facility, so that's the only place that yard sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| I'm not sure how yard sales are because I'm not involved in that, are regulated now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| I think if, and I'm going to be somewhat imaginative here because I'm not, don't regulate, don't administer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3745)|
| 1:02:37| but they, you have a yard sale, and if it becomes a permanent thing, you call 311, make a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| and Peter's office and neighborhood codes goes out and shuts them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| I guess the proposed code makes it more clear that outdoor sales are not something that can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| you can obtain a temporary permit for and operate in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| They are restricted in residential districts to places of worship and educational facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| so I think we've gone a step beyond or two or three steps beyond where we are in restricting those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3786)|
| 1:03:14| Councilwoman Welsh, before I call on you, let me ask our attorney to make a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| On the temporary outdoor entertainment that begins on 9-32, I've heard it from a couple of people on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| In regards to, I mean, yes, rummage sales, one thing, but the way it's presently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3807)|
| 1:03:34| unless it's changed in the draft that hasn't been released yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| it looks like a neighborhood could host a carnival or a circus as a temporary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| Even the temporary outdoor entertainment is restricted to those events associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| and conducted by a place of worship or an educational facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| so what we're thinking about is maybe it is a small carnival that's at a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| but it's only at either a place of worship or an educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| I recall when my daughter was in elementary school, they'd have a Saturday fundraising event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3842)|
| 1:04:10| This would be that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| A neighborhood could likely host it, but they'd have to do it in conjunction with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| and have it conducted by a place of worship or an educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| Again, I think with this code, we're narrowing the opportunities for things like that beyond where we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3860)|
| 1:04:28| I think there's a lot of fear that we're opening the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| We're actually, in many cases, closing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| We've heard from the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| We've heard their concerns, and we've done our best to address them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| without overly restricting the opportunity for some places like places of worship and schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| to generate funds for their operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| Gerald, you sent us some policy issues earlier today, and they're in front of us right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| and I'm going to assume that these are in front of us because they need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| in order for you to be able to move forward with the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| I know that there are probably other issues that we need to talk about, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| but since it sounds like these are the things that are a limiting factor for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| I'm wondering if we should look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| Are you going to walk us through these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| He's going to walk us through that, but are there issues, before we go on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| are there issues that have already come up that we need to have a straw vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| to figure out if we are giving Mr. Green proper guidance for this final draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3932)|
| 1:05:42| You're asking about what we just talked about with the zoning administrator making those kinds of decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3942)|
| 1:05:53| and whether or not there would be an opportunity for some type of review of those decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| I would kind of piggyback on what Councilwoman Ryder said about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| having some mechanism for the neighborhoods to have some type of review of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| I'm actually kind of surprised we don't have that now, so I could see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| But, you know, there's a lot more to the temporary outdoor entertainment than what we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| It's firework shows, horse shows, carnivals, circuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| All those are in the definition on page 216.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| You know, I talked with Chief Sharp, and he was concerned about the firework shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| and whether or not that would, you know, potentially be allowed anyway in all residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| And the point that you were making, Gerald, was that this is only in –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| it's only for, you know, like a religious group or an educational group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| but it's allowed in all residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| So could I rent my house to the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| and then my neighbors are living next to like a circus for five days in a row?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| Where do you live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4026)|
| 1:07:14| I'm actually trying to come back to reality after that comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| because I think that is grasping so far out into what could be that it's no longer realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| And I'm sorry to say that, but that is just ridiculous that that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| And I think we have – what we're trying to do is to allow what –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| you know, we have firework shows in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| that are permitted through the proper process with input by the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| This is an additional step to address those to make sure that there's an additional review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| We have circuses that are permitted on several levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| This is an additional step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| The restriction on those uses in residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| only is that they have to be conducted and on the church place of worship or an educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4080)|
| 1:08:10| I'm not sure that – this is where maybe I'm glad I'm not interpreting the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| but I would not consider a house that's rented by a church to be a place of worship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| unless they actually conduct services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| And then that's where the discretion of the zoning administrator comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| that you can't operate a circus on a residential lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| because of the parking requirements and other infrastructure requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| And I think that's where we have to rely upon the skills and abilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| and knowledge of the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| What it says is the temporary outdoor entertainment in the residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| is restricted to those events associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| and conducted by a place of worship or an educational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| So maybe there's some changing in that language that would make it so that we wouldn't have –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| and I agree with you, I don't know that we're going to see this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| I would hope that Peter would not do this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| but do we want to have that kind of language and be open to that kind of a thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| I'll say this. It's more than just the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Even outside of the residential districts, when people come in around the holidays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| and they want to have their haunted house, they come to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4161)|
| 1:09:29| Or there's a bunch of different temporary uses that come around starting in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| And they'll come into even commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| And it's not just me saying, hey, that sounds good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| but I'm getting with Mr. Hagerman and his team saying, how is this going to function?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| And we require a detailed site plan saying, okay, where are your rides going to be located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| Where is the parking going to be located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| How are the people going to get from the parking to the rides without crossing traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| And it's complicated in the commercial setting where we're not even talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| whether the use is appropriate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| I think what Director Green is talking about and his frustration is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| in a residential district, I don't know how you would have an event like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| and be able to meet all the other requirements for it to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| Because it's not just me, it's the city has to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| with the infrastructure and the functionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| Do you want to take a straw poll on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| Because I'd say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| I mean, this has got to be left up to administrative guidelines and oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| This can't all be spelled out in council votes and council rulings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| I mean, you've got to trust administration for these kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| You do now, we don't have an outbreak of it now, and you want to stick with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| And so you've got to trust these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| That's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| And we've given them the tools to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| And until that breaks, that's what you've got to go with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| And it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| It's working now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| You're not adding any other opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| I mean, you're taking it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| You've talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| You're narrowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| We're not opening it wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| So, I mean, I think you've got to look at it in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| We're never going to get to what your comments are on ADUs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| and the other things, the big things we want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| Unless there are other comments in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| we are going to move on to the policy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| Are you comfortable with that, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| I'll go anywhere you want to, except circuses and animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| Although with two cats and two dogs in my house, sometimes there's a circus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| I'll tell your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| They know they're animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| They're comfortable with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| First, our policy issue is ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| And as stated in the brief summary report I provided to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| we've discussed ADUs quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| There are proponents for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| and there are people who are concerned about their impact on residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| The standards currently for ADUs include limits on the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4340)|
| 1:12:26| You can only have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| It's proportionate not only to the principal dwelling but also to the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| There are some basic design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| The owner has to occupy the property either in the principal dwelling or in the ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| Based on direction provided at an earlier workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| the code will be amended to require one off-street parking place per ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| There has been a question of whether ADUs should be of special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| in the EN, RN-1, and RN-2 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| They're currently permitted in those districts if they're special review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| Special use would require review and approval by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| The research we've been able to conduct on similar cities does not show a proliferation of ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| There are some cities where housing is in critical supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| where there's actually an effort by the city to develop ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| and there are more in those cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| But cities that have growth similar to Knoxville, ADUs are not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| I support it as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| I mean, you've made great compromise from the original introduction to ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| ADUs are very prevalent in our city today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| and in many of our neighborhoods all across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| I think your compromise in making it, providing parking and providing owner-occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| and design standards is a great compromise and great protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| and I support it as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| I would second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| Are we comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| Is that your straw poll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| That's my straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Why are you looking at me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| You guys are, like, looking for opposition over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| Yeah, I would say that, you know, we could look at it as a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| considering that there may be some, you know, infrastructural issues that we talked about in previous workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4473)|
| 1:14:41| that might make it more difficult to have something like this in certain places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| So as a special use, it might make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| So I'll put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| I just was going to make a comment based on recent comments I heard at a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| You know, I live in one of the neighborhoods that does have ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| I have neighbors down the street, and it's a sister that lives in their ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| and I could go up and down the street, and it's well-vetted folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| People don't typically put bad guys in their carriage house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| My sister lived in one in the historic area near Augusta College in Augusta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| The family lived there with their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| I realize some folks are not going to agree with me on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| but the problems, if you ask my neighbors, the problems that we've had with crime in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| a lot of them were long-term families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| It was owner-occupied properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| It was not – I can't in my mind think of any time where it was one of the carriage houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| where we had somebody that was a crime outbreak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| and I know folks are going to disagree with me, but I live it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| I live it every day, so I'm fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| I think it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| These are fair compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| I think this off-street parking was a point of contention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| and I think this addresses parking crowding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| and I think that the owner-occupied part of it also addresses that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| So I'm happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| Are we ready to move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| The next one is the size limit in the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| Currently, structures are limited to 10,000 square feet unless they meet certain design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| Those design standards are, in my mind, pretty minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| They are that the development maintains privacy of adjacent residential lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| through techniques such as decreased height, additional landscape and screening measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| building massing and design to mitigate adverse impacts of noise and lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| and increased setbacks above those required from adjacent residential lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| Building design elements incorporate pedestrian-scale facilities such as awnings and storefront windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| And finally, the design of the site circulation system provides adequate and safe access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| for both motor vehicles and alternate modes of transportation, including pedestrians and bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| There have been concerns that that size limit will make it, with design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| if you want to go more than 10,000 square feet, that the cost of those design elements makes it infeasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| The purpose of the office district is, in many cases, to serve as a transition from residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| to more densely developed, intensely developed commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| The size limit was put in to thinking that that would help achieve that goal of transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| from the intense commercial areas to residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| I'm sensitive to the concern of some developers that that size limit may cost them too much to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4662)|
| 1:17:52| The staff recommendation, in lieu of going back to our current standard of 30% of lots area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4672)|
| 1:18:00| which means that on a less than two-acre parcel, you could have a 30,000-square-foot building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| which could be next to your 1,200-square-foot home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| is that we limit that size limit to those office districts that are but a residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4690)|
| 1:18:17| a single-family residential district to maintain that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| So if you have an office district, let's say, on Parkside Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4700)|
| 1:18:27| and between two commercial areas or between a commercial area and a high-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| or multifamily residential neighborhood, the size limit would not be applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4713)|
| 1:18:40| And that may be a compromise that preserves the use of that district as a transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| but also allows those developers who have office-owned properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| that are not adjacent to a single-family residentially-zoned property to build larger structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Well, this is something we've been talking about since the first draft, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| And I think I've said before, I think I said the first time that 10,000 is just too big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| even for that transition zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| The homes that are budding up against it are usually much smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| But there's still a lot of these areas left that were front coming off of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4757)|
| 1:19:24| or Dean Hill Drive, Paper Mill Drive, that do back up to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| and a 10,000-square-foot building as a minimum is just too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| So I think it's appropriate to either not have that standard or for it to be greatly reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4772)|
| 1:19:41| So I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| I think that's a good move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| That's my strong poll number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| Yeah, I think in our previous discussion we talked about the 10,000 number being pretty arbitrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| and trying to come up with what would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| So I'm certainly in favor of going back to the current standard at the 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| So I'd support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| Here with the current standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| Isn't the current standard 30%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| And I think, and I'd state again, the challenge there is you get a lot of less than two acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4812)|
| 1:20:21| and you can put a 30,000-square-foot building on it next to your single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| I'm just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4830)|
| 1:20:34| That's what you're asking, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| And this is deleting it from 10,000 and going back to the current standard at 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| No, the staff recommendation was that we keep that 10,000-square-foot, and maybe it is too large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| and I'm open on that, but only have the design standards apply when it's adjacent to a single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4847)|
| 1:20:54| residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| Delete size limit unless minimal standards are deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| Well, that was the question, and that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| But the staff recommendation is not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| That's the issue, delete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| The staff recommendation is to maintain that size limit and design standards only when the office district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4870)|
| 1:21:18| abuts a single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Can I clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| You're saying the feedback you got was to delete the size limit, and you're asking us whether we're on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| with that, and you're not saying you're on board with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| I'm not saying I'm not on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| I'm on board with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| I'm on board with delete the 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| It's too large, it's too random, and it's unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| That's my thought on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Is it the size limit that triggers the design center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| The size limit, you can build up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Let's just start from scratch again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| What's the building of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Are we talking about the size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| Because I think that's where this is just not clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Maybe I'm just failing the IQ test here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| I'm starting from two years of living, breathing, and dreaming this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| I need to start at ground zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| We weren't dreaming with you, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| Currently, as proposed in the draft, if you have an office zone anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4929)|
| 1:22:16| you can build a 9,999-square-foot building that has no design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4936)|
| 1:22:26| I think there's a requirement that a sidewalk be provided from the parking lot to the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| Very no design standards, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| If it goes over 10,000 square feet, it has to meet these design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4955)|
| 1:22:43| No special use, it's just review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| Deleting that, just to be clear, deleting the size limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| George, I think what you're suggesting would actually potentially create even larger buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| Deleting this provision would allow larger buildings with no design standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4983)|
| 1:23:11| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| What staff recommends is keep the standard as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| If you're over 10,000 square feet and you're in an office district adjacent to a single-family residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| you have to meet certain size standards or design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| You can go up to 9,999 square feet and have no design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| but once you go over 10,000, you have to have these minimal design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| And that's what you're recommending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| That's what I'm recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| And I'd like to hear more from Councilman Wallace, who said that 10,000 may be too large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| I'll give more background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| Well, the design standard now is it has to be all brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| I mean, today, currently, in our current zone, it has to be a masonry product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5035)|
| 1:24:03| That's the way I remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| No? Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| Currently, there's no design standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| There are no design standards in the office districts today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| The maximum lot coverage is 35% as it stands today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| And there's no maximum building size in the current?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| 35% of the lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| There's not a square foot maximum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| No square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| And so you're proposing 30% lot coverage from 35%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5073)|
| 1:24:40| and design standards only on those buildings greater than 10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| No, no lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| And no lot coverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| No lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| If you're over 10,000 square feet, you have those minimal design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| And we started the threshold with 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| There was some concern about that being too limiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| so it was increased in a previous draft to 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| Thank you, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| I'll try to start at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| I'll start at the beginning, the first draft, and then the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| If your building exceeded 5,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| then anywhere your office district was located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| you had to meet these design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| If it exceeded 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| I'm okay with design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| I'm okay with design standards in residential property and on commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| I think that's, you know, I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| So that's, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| So it sounds like what you've done is come up with a compromise solution to say design standards for 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5147)|
| 1:25:54| and above only if it's adjacent to single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| I think that sounds like a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| Picking up maybe on Councilman Wallace's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| I'd even be willing to amend that to say if it's over 5,000 square feet because 5,000 is a big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| If you're in a 1,500-square-foot house and you have a 4,999-square-foot blank wall staring at you, that's a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5167)|
| 1:26:16| I think design standards are reasonable and acceptable in offices that have got residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5176)|
| 1:26:27| They're acceptable anywhere, in my opinion, and they're acceptable in residential, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| Not that that's before us at this point, but that's my straw poll opinion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| So are we suggesting that it be 5,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| That's what staff recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| I think staff's smarter than we are on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| So I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| I mean, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| So this is different than looking at the maximum gross floor area of an office on page 5-4 in chart 9-1 or 5-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5214)|
| 1:27:05| This is exactly what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| So this is what we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| That's what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| And the proposed rule here is that the maximum gross floor area is 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5232)|
| 1:27:20| and the current version of office is 30 percent of the 35 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| And then the maximum building height, you've still got it at 45?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| 45, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| So are we okay with 5,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| I'd go back to what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Does that mean 5,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| It means 35 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| I think I've got the straw poll that we go to 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| Here's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| 5,000 square feet, design standards kick in when you're adjacent to a single-family residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| I'm okay with the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| I'm talking about the gross floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| I think what I heard from the council was 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| The majority said 5,000 square feet in design standards adjacent to the residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| You already have the height standards, so that's going to limit it to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5305)|
| 1:28:32| Just to be clear, and there's no opportunity for an increase outside of a variance if there's a hardship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| And there, again, minimal design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| Just like now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Adjacent to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Councilman Roberto, do you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| The next issue is with regard to lot sizes in the RN-2 and RN-3 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| The planning commission recommended that they had gone back and forth in various drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5337)|
| 1:29:04| In this draft, the planning commission recommended that they be decreased from 10,000 square feet to 7,500 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5344)|
| 1:29:12| in the RN-2 and 7,000 square feet in the RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| There are concerns from some neighborhoods that that standard will enable existing single-family homes to be divided into duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| The staff, just throwing out an option here, would be to increase the lot size for duplexes to 8,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5365)|
| 1:29:33| in both those districts for duplexes and require duplexes to go through a special-use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5373)|
| 1:29:41| Currently, they would be subject to special-use review in the RN-2 but not in the RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| So that would provide an opportunity for public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| It would prevent their standard 7,500-square-foot homes on those lots from being divided into duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5390)|
| 1:29:58| which was a fear in some of the older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| But it would be a special use in both RNs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| That's the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| So that's what you're recommending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| Special use in both RN-2 and RN-3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| That's one we've gotten a lot of e-mail about, and you're responding to that, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| That's what we're, in RN-2 and RN-3, raising the minimum lot size to 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| To 8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| No, it's 8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| And that's just, I'm willing to listen to direction from council because you have the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5426)|
| 1:30:34| It's been asked at 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| I don't know what the difference would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| I don't know why you picked 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| You just picked a compromise, 5 over 8 and 10, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| I'd say stick with 10 and be happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| I mean, is the 8 arbitrary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| Somewhat, but the concern was that in some of our traditional neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| the standard lot is 75 by 100, 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| 75? Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| No, I mean 50 by 150, 50 by 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| And sorry, got my numbers wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| But 7,500 square feet, so 8,000 square feet would prevent those traditional lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| homes on those traditional lots, from being subdivided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| We've also heard that duplexes provide opportunities for homeownership for younger people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5479)|
| 1:31:27| because they can live in one side and rent the other, that they provide additional housing opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5487)|
| 1:31:34| And that 10,000 square foot lot size made it more challenging to build a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| So I'm trying to be sensitive to both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| come up with something that would address the concern of existing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| on 7,500 square foot lots being divided into duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| but allow a reasonable opportunity for development of new duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| So it wasn't completely arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| It was arbitrary somewhat, 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| I'll stick with 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| That would be my straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| So I just, I think this issue around the square footage is really important in these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| From the conversations I've had in the advisory committee, how many lots are 10,000 square feet in these zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5533)|
| 1:32:23| I mean, there just aren't, basically by setting that 10,000 square foot requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| if I understand correctly from the conversations I've had and looking at the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| that would eliminate the opportunity altogether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| virtually eliminate the opportunity to build duplexes in these zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| It would have a drastic effect, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| So I understand the concerns of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| So what would 8,000 square feet do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| Does it capture a greater, I mean, how many of the lots in these particular zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5573)|
| 1:33:01| and I know you're not going to know the exact numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| but does it capture a greater number of lots so that there at least would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| There would be some opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| There are some lots that do meet the 8,000 square foot minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| It does reduce the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| But it addresses the concern, and that's our challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| Again, as I stated in my introductory remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| we're hearing comments from a diversity of, comments that reflect the diverse thoughts and opinions of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| So I'm trying to find a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| Maybe another compromise, and this is something that I mentioned when this issue came up before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5613)|
| 1:33:39| is making them a special use and leaving it at 7,500 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| because that would require that public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| The special use is reviewed by the planning commission, and they make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| but that decision can be appealed to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| So I know it's an arduous process on either side for that to receive permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5636)|
| 1:34:03| or to combat a proposal for a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5643)|
| 1:34:08| but that does put it in the public review and public realm so that there's more reflection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5648)|
| 1:34:16| and it's not just you have a 7,500 square foot lot or a 10,000 square foot lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| so you can build a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| That would provide an opportunity for review to ensure that it complements the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| compatible with the character of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| and is not detrimental to the overall neighborhood feel and prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5672)|
| 1:34:44| So I would say for myself, I agree with the special use process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| I wouldn't agree to go back to the 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| I think that's just my thought on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| Can I add a little bit of context?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| A lot of these areas are currently zoned R2, and under RECO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| we're recognizing the built character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| The current R2 district allows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| No, that's not the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| The neighborhoods that have complained and made comments are solid R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| Sorry, I'm a little impassioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| It's my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| Never mind then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| It was my understanding that some of the current R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| because I know there were some other neighborhoods that there was stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| There's some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| R1A does permit duplexes now on lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| 7,515,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| But anyway, if it was R2, you need 9,000 square feet for a duplex by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| That's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| Well, we did get a letter today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| We've gotten a letter previously from Forth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| and we've gotten a letter previously from Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| Our neighborhood is proposed as we're currently R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| Forth and Gill is predominantly R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| We're R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| In the charts, R1A is compared to RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| Old North, if you look at the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| we are a literal patchwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| We are RN7 to RN2, because we are everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| Because we are the neighborhood where they came through with bulldozers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| and tore out 60 to 80 houses in one swath to make, you know, the RN7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| And so the fear is that you take an entire area with houses that maybe aren't in the best condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5790)|
| 1:36:38| and you put them at points as things grow in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| you put them in the balance where the land under them, like what you see in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| the land is more valuable than the house, and so the houses get torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| And I know that one discussion point that got thrown out to someone in my district was that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| oh, well, maybe this could work for the historic and not other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| These houses aren't protected by an overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| We have a lot of out-of-town owners, and when you have out-of-town owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| there's also maintenance issues with the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| but they're not responsive to conversations about recode or H1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5832)|
| 1:37:19| And so they're not protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| And, you know, we are the neighborhoods that give people the opportunity for single-family homeownership near downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5841)|
| 1:37:29| And our corridors in the process of recode is where we wanted to see a lot of the growth and mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| And if you look at the neighborhood and you look at the map, you'll see pockets of R and 5, R and 4, R and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| You see opportunities at Baxter and Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| We've got full city blocks there that people are waiting to build higher-density stuff, and that's fine with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5867)|
| 1:37:55| But we don't want to give up our 20 little houses to multiplexes, what we see in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5875)|
| 1:38:03| so we don't have a single-family neighborhood anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| In short, I think what I'm hearing you say is that you support the 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| I support the 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| I support my neighbors and my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Let's take a quick straw poll on the 10,000 versus 8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| Is that the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| I mean, do we really need a straw poll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| I mean, there's only seven of us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Somebody can make an amendment at the meeting if they feel like it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| Well, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| It gives Mr. Green some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| It gives me some level of confidence in making revisions for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5914)|
| 1:38:39| Let me make one additional comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| Many, many of the lots on Glenwood, Scott, there are several on Luttrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| Old North has tons of 10,000-square-foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| My whole side of the street is about 200 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| We're not 100- and 150-foot-deep lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| So we have an H-1, but they could come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| and hopefully in this day and age do it in a less haphazard way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5941)|
| 1:39:07| You know, we suffered greatly to lots of cutting up with no permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5947)|
| 1:39:13| and there's some unsafe places that people spent a lot of money putting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5953)|
| 1:39:20| keeping them from being demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| You have convinced me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| I support 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| Doesn't the RN-3 already have 10,000 for duplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| The December draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| The Planning Commission recommendation which followed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| was to go what has not been incorporated into a new draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| recommended that for RN-3, 7,000 square feet for duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| and the RN-2, 7,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| That's the Planning Commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Even though I'm looking at a draft that says two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| That's because perhaps we stopped making new copies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| until we got complete direction from the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| or more complete direction from the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| So the draft does state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| The draft does state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| We're dealing with this policy issue in front of you, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| The draft does state that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| but the Planning Commission recommendation as presented to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| has had 7,000 for the RN-3 and 7,500 for the RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| Everybody in favor of the 10,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| increase the lot size for the duplexes in RN-2 and RN-3 to 10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| Both districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| I mean, it's already 10,000 in RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| I mean, I'm comfortable three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Three, four, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| I think we got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| I hope that people aren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Can I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| Gerald, I just want to make sure that it's on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| I think that we need to continue to seek opportunities to find places for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| zones that allow for these small scale, not the huge multifamily that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6060)|
| 1:41:08| you know, when we think about multifamily, I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| Because I hear these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| I have them for my own neighborhood, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| I just want to make sure you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| I'm not trying to tear your houses down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| Because I have the same issues in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| Someone else will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| But I do think that it's important that we find those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6083)|
| 1:41:28| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| And, again, what we're doing with these zones, and this goes to the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| I think AIA representatives left, but, you know, the transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| that we're not transitioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| We have a built fabric in this neighborhood that makes it tough to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| we're high density or high intensity here, medium intensity, low intensity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| high density, medium density, low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| But we have those tools in the proposed zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| So as time goes on, we can find those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| We're looking hard for more opportunities for R and 4 now that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| appropriate that don't adversely impact neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| We're working with neighborhood leaders to identify areas where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| appropriate, where there are opportunities for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| We're working with property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| And we have the tools for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| Well, this is where you're trying to go over the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| And you've got to protect where the investments are in your houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| And I think this is where this overrides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| I'm for, you know, there's other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| But, I mean, I think for the whole city and for where the investments are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| it's for the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| I mean, it's not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| But I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| There are places where it would be very suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| But I think for the, you know, for what we're here to try to protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| I think you've got to protect what your investments are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| As I'm sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| I'm just wondering why are we thinking it should be the same for both R and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| and R and 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| I mean, isn't the whole idea of having different zones is you have different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| standards and, I mean, theoretically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| it should be easier to build a duplex in an R and 3 than an R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Am I missing something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| Yes, because even with the lot size currently in R and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| it's a special use, which requires review and approval by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| Commission looking at compatibility and a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| In R and 3, it's a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| which means that you go to Plans Review and Inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| take your permit, your site plan and building drawings, get a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6206)|
| 1:43:33| and you start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| And that's R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| In R and 2, you submit your plans to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| There's a public hearing with public notification, public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| And so it is tougher, even though the lot size is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| But we can look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| We'll look at the lot sizes in the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| I mean, we've got a lot of residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| I mean, we have eight, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| So, I mean, I think if we're going to have eight, they should be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| I mean, that's just my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| I'm just sitting here going through it on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| And we'll look at that and look at the lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| We've received a couple of comments, R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| But the comments that were received from the Fourth and Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| they are proposed to be designated as R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| and they said that they were comfortable with that if the lot size for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| duplexes were increased to 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| And I think that's what Councilmember Ryder was alluding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| So, again, I think that special use versus permitted use makes a great distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6275)|
| 1:44:41| That is, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| I mean, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| I was just looking at all these charts and numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| And just for the record, currently we have innumerable residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| because we have planned residential, and each one is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| We have probably on the map now 50 different residential districts in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6296)|
| 1:45:04| because every planned residential district is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| Councilmember Berco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| I mean, I think we've touched on something that's very important here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| and I'm basically just echoing a lot of what I've heard from my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| You know, the minimum lot size is something that's very important because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| if we get that wrong, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| you could start seeing some of your housing stock disappear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| like Councilperson Ryder was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| So I think this is definitely an area where we need to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| Council, why don't we take a pause and reconvene at 7.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6334)|
| 1:45:43| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| Mr. Green, if you would like to talk about revised standards for home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6346)|
| 1:45:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| As stated in the information I provided to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| we're trying to address the changing work environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| while also protecting neighborhoods with standards for home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| We've heard from neighborhood representatives who said that the proposed standards are too lax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| We've heard from others, including a well-written response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| comments from Jennifer Roach at the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| that they're too restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| We feel, as staff, that they are appropriate with the revisions noted on the information I provided to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6387)|
| 1:46:34| with regard to limiting the square footage of the site and clarifying a few items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6394)|
| 1:46:41| And, again, we feel that those standards are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| I'd be happy to listen to comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| Those standards that we propose are considered by Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6408)|
| 1:46:53| who will have to enforce those standards with his staff to be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| We feel they would not adversely impact neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| but they would allow reasonable use of a home for an occupation and workplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| from everything from someone who has a computer and only works on the computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6426)|
| 1:47:12| to an artisan who may make paper mache cutouts and sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6432)|
| 1:47:23| The sales, the clarification on the sales, that only items produced on site can be sold, physically sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6443)|
| 1:47:33| but there is no limit on Internet or, I think, that type of sales where there's no impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6453)|
| 1:47:41| no customers coming to the home because we realize that there's no way to track Internet sales and operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6461)|
| 1:47:48| So we feel that is an appropriate standard for home occupations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| and those standards will work and can be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| Let's go to the specific pages that you're referencing, and let's look at it the way you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| 10-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| 10-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| With that in mind, what's on page 10-11 doesn't include some of the standards we've incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6490)|
| 1:48:17| such as the 25% limit on limiting the space devoted to the home occupation to 25% of the gross floor area of the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6497)|
| 1:48:27| How does that compare to what we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| It's what we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| I think it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| It's the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| Same, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| 25% now and 25% going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| I think you pretty much said last time that you were trying to make it the same, what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| That's what we're, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| So what have you made more restrictive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6529)|
| 1:48:58| Nothing more restrictive than we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| We have tried to, and some may argue that it's more lax because we've done away with the distinction between home office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6541)|
| 1:49:09| and home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6549)|
| 1:49:10| Lump them all as one because the home office is a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6550)|
| 1:49:14| We're allowing them in all home occupations in all residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| whereas currently there are some limitations on the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| Home offices are permitted in certain districts, home occupations in other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6561)|
| 1:49:29| If the prohibition continues on outdoor storage, no outdoor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| outward appearance of a home occupation other than a small sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| I don't know how you'd measure traffic to be, you know, that would be greater volumes than normally be expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6578)|
| 1:49:46| I don't know how you would measure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| If we get a complaint and we go out there and there's, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| We get very specific complaints in my office as to when violations occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6592)|
| 1:49:59| and I authorize my folks to go after hours or stop on the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| and if we show up and we see a line of cars lined up to buy beanie babies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6603)|
| 1:50:13| we'll have an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Well, we have more people working from home today than ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| and the trend's continuing to go that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| And I think people have the right to work in their home as long as it's not disturbing the neighbors to a reasonable amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6621)|
| 1:50:30| And much beyond that, I think you've got to leave it pretty open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| I mean, it's their home, and we're all working from home, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| I think the biggest difference that you'll see is in our current Article V, Section 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| It actually articulates home occupations that you may have, you know, limiting to a barber, a dressmaker, stuff like that, whereas in RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6644)|
| 1:50:57| we don't articulate the individual occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| It's regulating to the size of the primary structure and how it affects the adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6661)|
| 1:51:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6674)|
| 1:51:15| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| Are we comfortable, then, with this suggestion on the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| Vice Mayor, let me just make sure I've got something right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| So the 25% rule is in the current code, and you've recommended it here in this discussion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6686)|
| 1:51:36| Am I correct that the limitation on the occupation not being in an accessory building is in the current code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6696)|
| 1:51:45| but it would not be in what you've done here in RECODE?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6705)|
| 1:51:58| I believe that is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| If your sculpting equipment is in the detached garage today, we would say you cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6723)|
| 1:52:13| You have to put it inside your house versus under the RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| Well, I'm just making sure we understand what's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| And then the other part would be I think that the need for parking generated by the conduct of such home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| shall be off the street rather than other than in a required front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6747)|
| 1:52:36| That's in number six in the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| Yes, and parking is not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| And parking is not addressed in RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| So there are some differences here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| And I guess my thought would be that I'm pretty comfortable with the home occupations as it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6769)|
| 1:52:55| so I probably would, as functionally possible, leave it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| The current?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| The current, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| Other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| Well, you mentioned Jennifer Roach, and Jennifer, do you want to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| I mean, is that such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| I mean, if a council representative asks you, yeah, it's a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6791)|
| 1:53:19| He called you out, so, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| Jennifer Roach, Knoxville Area Association of Realtors, 609 Weissgarber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| I'd just like to speak on home occupations a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| They are trending for our members, for realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| The cloud-based brokerage is becoming more popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| Folks are working out of their homes more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| These folks have an assistant or multiple assistants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| They may be at that home or working remotely from their own residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| or working on-site on different properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| The kind of foundational question I would like to ask is who does this apply to, home occupations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6837)|
| 1:54:04| Is that anyone, or is it just licensed or registered businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| Because that would change a lot of our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| So does this apply to me if I'm a W-2 or 1099 person working remotely in my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| for a national company based somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| Or is it just for me if I'm a registered business here in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| I'll start and then ask Peter to chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| As written, it would apply to both cases and allow all to work from their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6873)|
| 1:54:41| Under our current regulations, there are certain limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6881)|
| 1:54:47| In this, Councilman Roberto is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| In some instances, the proposed standards are more lax than the current ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| It would enable anyone to work from their home, whether they're licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| or they, I think, and I'll admit that I had a home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| when I started my own business many years ago and started working from my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| I knew I was illegal because the city had a home occupation standard and I could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| But I was not legal because I didn't have a business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| until I did some contract work for the city and they made me get a business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6920)|
| 1:55:29| But I was, you know, and I think many people are in that case now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| They start a home business or have a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| They don't realize in some cases that they need a business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| So we're not penalizing them and say you have to have a business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| That's another office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| I don't think Peter is going to check for their business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| And let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| I think we have, as someone stated, I think we have made good strides with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| in making it general versus a list of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| Our concerns are that the home occupation regulations should very appropriately address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6960)|
| 1:56:07| exterior environmental concerns and not come into the home, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6967)|
| 1:56:13| as in like limiting in R1, not R1 districts, but in Section R, Paragraph 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6973)|
| 1:56:22| no more than one person other than members of the household may be engaged in such occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| That kind of is going into who's inside the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| If you're concerned about a lot of people on the lot, the traffic section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| paragraph of that section takes care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| So I think there are the traffic and the nuisance and the general basic, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=6996)|
| 1:56:43| nuisance and traffic regulations take care of a lot of the other specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| more intrusion type regulations in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| So those were some of our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| Besides realtors, we have a lot of affiliated members who take care of the rest of the real estate transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7013)|
| 1:57:00| for residential and commercial transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| Those are a lot of mostly local mom and pops, skilled trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| They work out of their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| There are a couple builders who live across the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| Sometimes there are folks coming to get their paychecks or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| but most of the time they're doing their office work at home and meeting their workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| their independent contractors or their W-2 workers at the sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| But if they were meeting too much in the neighborhood and it was clogging the streets and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| again, the traffic part takes care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| So I would just say with the recommendations that I sent to look at only, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| really concentrating only on those exterior environmental concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| and staying away from those specific interior intrusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| And that would include the 25 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| That's new to me tonight, so I don't know that I could speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7070)|
| 1:57:55| I've heard others say that that's difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7075)|
| 1:58:00| I'm not in the enforcement business, so I'd leave that to Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| That's an interior intrusion, and it would be something that we would likely not support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| I was just going to say I like the analogy that Peter gave about having a structure outside the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| where you can keep stuff related to your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| I mean, if you're an arts and crafts person, you're selling stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| why not be able to have your equipment under the current code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| That's not allowable, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| That is under the current, but it wouldn't be under this new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| Currently you cannot have your sewing room outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| Now, wait a minute. Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| Currently you may not have your sewing room above the garage where you're making dresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| Right, and I think that's logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| You mean if it's a detached garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| Yeah, and I think that's very logical to have your work stuff away from your living space if you so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7131)|
| 1:58:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| So you're in support of the detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| I'd just like to add for clarity is that there have been lots of articles, news, radio, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7144)|
| 1:59:12| commentary from folks saying I've gone to neighborhood meetings, I made a chart, I shared it with Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7152)|
| 1:59:19| I shared it with some neighborhood groups that were very concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| that had been misinformed that the new proposed code was way more restrictive on this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7162)|
| 1:59:31| And once I showed it to them and broke it down, I'm like, as you can see, it's actually way more lax than it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7171)|
| 1:59:40| I'm in favor of the 25% because if you look at the current code that we have versus the proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7180)|
| 1:59:48| the current code, its definition is the use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7188)|
| 1:59:55| shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| and not more than 25% of the floor area of the dwelling unit shall be used in the conduct of the home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7200)|
| 2:00:08| The new does not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| It just says a use of land or structure or portion thereof customarily incidental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| and subordinate to the principal use of the land or structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| I feel like when you put it in the hands of anybody to determine for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| or it's left up to interpretation what incidental and subordinate is, and I feel like a measurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7223)|
| 2:00:29| and I've heard Peter say they're not going to run around with a tape measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| To me, it's not important whether it's 30% or 31% or 32%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| I feel like a number gives an expectation to say this is a residential zone, this is a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7238)|
| 2:00:47| It's incidental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| It's subordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| And then we give some quantification to give guidance as to what that is versus what does incidental mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7250)|
| 2:00:55| What does subordinate mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| How do I quantify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| Which part of my home is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| I queried members of my district who had home occupations who do their business from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7260)|
| 2:01:08| One person specifically said they estimated they used 20% of their home when it was a home occupation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| and then once they've decided to go out and purchase and rent commercial space, they are using about 10% of their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7275)|
| 2:01:22| and I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| I grew up with a dad who was a plumber, and, of course, he didn't have an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| He did all his work at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| Really and truly, in terms of meeting your workers, they came to my grandmother's house and picked up the truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7291)|
| 2:01:38| and dropped off stuff and picked up a paycheck and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| but they weren't actually working at my grandmother's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| They were working outside on sites where we were getting permits for the jobs that occurred there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| and I know that's up for debate, and we can discuss whether people come and go and pick up work trucks and all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| and I have that issue in my district right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| But, you know, in terms of a real estate business, you could say, okay, I'm a real estate agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7317)|
| 2:02:04| and I'm using my spare room, and I have two extra spare rooms because I'm a single person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| I have all these extra spare rooms, so I will let other real estate agents come and be affiliates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| Well, you've now turned this into an office and a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| It's beyond, you know, incidental and subordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| It's now become an office complex in the middle of a residential zone, and that is what people are trying to avoid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7340)|
| 2:02:27| and that incurs, you know, we have a whole mall in my district that's empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| There's no lack of commercial space, so we don't need to turn all our residential areas into office complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7352)|
| 2:02:38| but I think the way it's written, it allows people to do what they've always done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| which is home occupation with less restrictions on exactly what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| Well, now, which way do you think it's written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| We have two versions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| Well, we've added the 25% back in, and we've added some specific things back in, animal hospitals, funeral homes, welding shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7370)|
| 2:03:04| You know, we have to discuss how we're going to approach what uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| I hear what Councilman Campin is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| I agree we're a maker city, so do we tell people that they can only make dresses in a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| but they can't make other crafts that, you know, if I'm making pottery, I don't really want to do that in my spare bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| That's kind of messy, so I don't know how we – it gets really, you know, weird and into the weeds as to quantifying it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7403)|
| 2:03:33| but there's a couple of things that have been added back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| The other thing is, you know, we're having new stuff given to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| and so it's basically are we making this decision on the fly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| Are we straw-pulling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| Is it going to come out in the next version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| Is that what we're telling you tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| Yeah, that's exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| We're keeping it open, I think, based on Jennifer's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| that maybe some clarification on the employees because we don't care if someone has employees outside the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7436)|
| 2:04:02| but we're trying to minimize that impact with some standards so no employees –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| no more than one employee other than those residing in the home can be consistently in the house or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7448)|
| 2:04:17| Well, what about her comments of just dealing with the exterior and not the interior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7457)|
| 2:04:23| We've heard lots of comments that if I say Jennifer wants us to move this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7463)|
| 2:04:29| we've heard a lot of comments that want us to move this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| The standards that we – that staff recommends put us right in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| which is a great place for yellow lines on the highway and possums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7476)|
| 2:04:42| I guess we have to be there a lot also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| Do you think it's necessary to point out that we can't have a funeral home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| or an animal hospital or a welding shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| Do I think it's important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| No, but there were comments that thought it was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| I think those ought to be stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| Okay, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| We could make a long list of things that we would not think is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| Once you start, I think it was better to have them not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7502)|
| 2:05:07| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| Okay, so I would –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| We're agreeable on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| But are you getting the sense of where we're going with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| Yes, sir, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| That's the main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| Any other comments or suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| That may be our straw poll right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| Not right now, Mr. Golden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| Does everyone feel comfortable with the 25%, as we've always had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| to help determine and give people parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| not for Peter to necessarily go out and measure with a yardstick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| but to give parameters of what incidental and subordinate means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| Realizing that the reality is that the enforcement of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7546)|
| 2:05:55| would only be triggered by complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| I mean, it's not like you're going to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| I don't even know if we're going to have access to the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| But there's a certain percentage of the population that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| when they know the rules, they're going to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| And I think that's what the council will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| Yes, I'm agreeable with 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| Jennifer, was there another comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| I just wanted to thank you for what Councilman Ryder said about allowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7577)|
| 2:06:21| like, your father's plumbing business to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| In Section R, Paragraph 1, no more than one person, blah, blah, blah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| may be engaged in such occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| Maybe adding in the words on-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| So that it would allow – that was our concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| is you're going to have that skilled trades with a lot of people working for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| which would, you know, be more than one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| But if you change it to just on-site, that that would limit, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| not having a brokerage running multiple offices out of one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| I think that's unfair to run a brokerage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| It's fine for, you know, if a husband and a wife are both real estate agents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| and they live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| Well, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| There's state law and other things that would come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| It's not a reality, but you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| Well, I just picked that as a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| Pick another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| Okay, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7635)|

| 2:07:21| Increased maximum height in the EKW district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| We've heard lots of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7643)|
| 2:07:24| We started with a height – tried to maintain the character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| but realizing that the growing area for downtown and the expansion area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| Staff recommends that the height limit be deleted with the provision that the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7652)|
| 2:07:37| be made clear that the Design Review Board has the limit to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| has the right to limit height as part of their mandatory design review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| to assure that the proposed building is incompatible with surrounding uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7665)|
| 2:07:53| And the Design Review – sorry, Darrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7675)|

| 2:08:00| They're in place, and there is design review required in that area, and they –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7680)|
| 2:08:05| They have similar tasks already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| Is that the only comment we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| Otherwise, this is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7693)|
| 2:08:14| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7694)|
| 2:08:15| Next is you heard the presentation by AIAE and the Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| regarding a prescriptive design review process and then one that was more –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7701)|
| 2:08:30| I can't remember the word now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| It's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7712)|
| 2:08:33| But subjective that would go through the planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| Staff recommends that we revise the ordinance to provide for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| and allow those options for development in those districts which have design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7720)|
| 2:08:50| Councilwoman Reuter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| That was what the presentation was about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7733)|
| 2:08:54| Spoke to earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| For clarity for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7739)|
| 2:09:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7740)|
| 2:09:01| Permission to put Director Green on the spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| I was –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| Can you articulate the differences between that review by planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| and what's already in RECODE as planned development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| Planned – this would be, for example, the Thombras Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| if it were on Broadway at Lamar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7762)|
| 2:09:31| That building, because of the materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| would not meet the strict limits of the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| They may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| I think – let's say they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| So instead of changing the material to brick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| they come through the planning staff and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| we're meeting the intent for quality materials, fenestration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7792)|
| 2:09:57| The planning staff says, okay, you're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7797)|
| 2:10:02| Your design is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7802)|
| 2:10:03| Planned development is taking the Broadway carpet site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| and raising the existing building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7808)|
| 2:10:10| putting a multi-story mixed-use development that has 10% of the required parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7810)|
| 2:10:18| because they are on the transit line and close to downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7818)|
| 2:10:21| and have requested that the free trolley ride go up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| and they have free scooters for everyone that have the restriction on zone protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| So that – and to meet community needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7831)|
| 2:10:35| they're providing 10% of their units as affordable units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| That's a big development way outside the limits of the underlying district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| with setbacks, with height, with minimal parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| So the design – or the subjective design approach is only for materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| and those design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| Planned development is much more encompassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| It would also be a development where they're proposing to stay off the steep slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7860)|
| 2:11:06| and put everything on one part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| and exceed the underlying density standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| So it's almost like planned development, like at a staff level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| Yeah, very light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| So that's not a completely separate – I was taken back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7877)|
| 2:11:24| I think that makes sense to have an option to go for planning staff approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7884)|
| 2:11:31| when you want to deviate as opposed to creating a whole new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| I was just thinking of let's make it easier for our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7896)|
| 2:11:40| So you don't have the details worked out yet, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| No, only in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| So I think we can work something out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7908)|
| 2:11:49| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| Questions of Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7910)|
| 2:11:51| Councilwoman Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| I think you just answered my question that the details hadn't been worked out yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| but I'm assuming because I think what I read here is that it's just those who are desiring flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7915)|
| 2:12:02| and so that will have to somehow be defined because I'm sure lots of people desire flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7922)|
| 2:12:09| Flexibility within very small parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7932)|
| 2:12:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| About 92%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| People desire flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7942)|
| 2:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7946)|
| 2:12:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| You're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| Enhanced lighting standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| Section 10-2 outlines some proposed exterior lighting standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| This is the first time that the City of Knoxville has delved into regulating exterior lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7955)|
| 2:12:41| other than in the forum districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7961)|
| 2:12:44| We've received comments that we should enhance these standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| and the staff recommendation is that we review those comments, incorporate those that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7970)|
| 2:12:56| and then within 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| Council direct staff to consider and work with stakeholders to develop a more comprehensive exterior lighting standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7978)|
| 2:13:10| In previous employment and then with my own firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| help communities develop lighting standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| and it's a very comprehensive, sometimes time-consuming task because you have to consider a lot of different elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=7997)|
| 2:13:25| I think that the standards are ñ I know the standards we have proposed are a good starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8005)|
| 2:13:31| Let's work with those, and then 18 months, maybe with a stakeholder committee direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8011)|
| 2:13:37| look at developing more comprehensive door lighting standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8017)|
| 2:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| Comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| I think the biggest ones that are most offensive are the former KUB street lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8027)|
| 2:13:53| So we'll see when the new ñ those are the ones that I find the most offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8033)|
| 2:13:59| So there's too high and they're too bright, and they do bleed over into property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8039)|
| 2:14:04| So I didn't know we could do anything about that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| So now maybe with the LEDs, it'll be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| It'll be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| I think you kind of have to wait to see how that's going to pan out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8051)|
| 2:14:14| They are more focused in those neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| They haven't made them to my neighborhood yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| So let me see if I get what you're saying clearly, Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| Your comment here is review comments submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| so we have a couple of groups that are submitting requests for lighting standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| and incorporate those that would enhance and complement the initial effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| So we'll find out when we get the next version what you decided is complementary and enhancing to what's already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8078)|
| 2:14:46| And then we will review that version of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8086)|
| 2:14:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| And what process will we use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8094)|
| 2:15:00| I think it's hard to comment on this when we don't know what you are saying you're going to include or not include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8100)|
| 2:15:06| So then my next question is, what process are we undertaking to ensure that we discuss it and revisit it 18 months later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8106)|
| 2:15:14| Just we're all just going to agree that we're going to, if we agree to pass whatever when we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8114)|
| 2:15:20| Some of these things we have discussed, keeping the stakeholder group going for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8120)|
| 2:15:27| Well, I think having goals and tasks for that group is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| and one of those could be to review the lighting standards by experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8131)|
| 2:15:37| There are a couple of other things that we've already identified for that task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8137)|
| 2:15:42| or that stakeholder committee to be tasked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| So we outline those tasks and put that in the first set of documents that's provided to the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8145)|
| 2:15:55| when they reconvene so that they know that's their charge and staff knows that's our charge also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8155)|
| 2:16:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| We're through with lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| So I think the one issue that I'll throw out there and take a scroll poll build on is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8169)|
| 2:16:15| we talked about it last time a lot, was the landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| and tying it to a landscaping bond or tying it to some way to enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8179)|
| 2:16:28| You'll see in the next few weeks in my proposed budget, we'll see what the mayor has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8188)|
| 2:16:33| but I've requested two positions to address landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8193)|
| 2:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| And tying it to some type of bond or something like that or completion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| In the perfect world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| I've got a landscape architect who's reviewing the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| And I've got an arborist who's out in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| That meets my expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| Now if there are other questions or comments that council would like to make before we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8215)|
| 2:17:02| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| I've got several things that I wanted to go over, but what I wanted to do is maybe take a second here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8225)|
| 2:17:12| and take a straw poll about the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| Right now we've got a time on I think it's May 14th that we're setting up a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8236)|
| 2:17:22| We've had a lot of discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| I think there's been a lot of confusion that everyone's talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| and some maybe more artfully worded questions that we might have understood some of the topics a little bit more in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8248)|
| 2:17:41| I definitely want to make sure that we have enough time to review the final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| And one thing that I've been concerned with is the timing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| What we've heard is that towards the end of this month we'll get the final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| Well, that could mean that we have two weeks to review the final draft prior to being in the same room voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8277)|
| 2:18:06| I'm thinking that, and I know that Gerald really can't tell us when it's going to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8286)|
| 2:18:13| because I think he's got issues with the Camaros group and who's going to be in town and able to work on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8293)|
| 2:18:22| I would think that we want at least 30 days from the issuance of the final draft to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8302)|
| 2:18:29| And my suggestion would be since I don't think we'll make that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8309)|
| 2:18:33| I would suggest that we make the May 14th a workshop and that we discuss the final draft then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| and then we schedule the vote sometime thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8319)|
| 2:18:44| Any other comments about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| I would agree with Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| I think it's only fair that we have time to review what's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8331)|
| 2:18:57| We're talking about things that have changed and we need time for people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| I think there's also time where we could discuss things on the map if people feel like there's changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8342)|
| 2:19:08| or things in their district that need to be discussed about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| I mean, I still feel we have a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| Time for us to have meetings with our constituents to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| And there's just a lot of moving parts that are going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8359)|
| 2:19:25| And I don't want to give the appearance that we're hurrying through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| I think we need to give its full time because no matter, it needs to be decided with this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8368)|
| 2:19:35| but some people aren't going to be here for what happens after it's passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| And some of us are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| And I think we need to take our time and get it right for the comfort of the public and for ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8381)|
| 2:19:47| since it's on some of us once it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8387)|
| 2:19:51| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8391)|
| 2:19:52| I agree with my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| I think, I mean, tonight's a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| We still have a lot to discuss and finalize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| I honestly feel like we're months away from a final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| And as much as I want to get through it as anybody else, I think we have to do it right and not rush it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8403)|
| 2:20:09| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| Well, I think this is going to be the way it is all the way to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| You're going to be discussing it and you're going to be on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| This is the way it was with the signed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| To infer, we're not going to be left with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| We're still living here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| We're still working here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8425)|
| 2:20:26| We're still going to be dealing with this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| And so it does affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| And it doesn't just affect the people that are left here to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| So it's a lot bigger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| But it's going to be that way all the way to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| And I think it's ready to give me the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| And we're going to plow through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| And it's going to be long meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| And I think I'm ready to put it to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| That's the way I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| I guess I had a question on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| To me, that's one thing that has given me a lot of heartburn from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8455)|
| 2:21:00| Because I never saw this as an effort to sort of rezone different properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| I thought we would update the code, talk about setbacks, talk about parking, talk about uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8464)|
| 2:21:10| But in terms of rezoning just different parcels in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| And then just looking at the map, there's, you know, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8476)|
| 2:21:20| So was there any thought to just giving every parcel the closest zone that exists now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8480)|
| 2:21:30| That's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| That's what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8491)|
| 2:21:32| That's obviously what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8492)|
| 2:21:35| But, like, there's some, I mean, there's some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| In some cases, you know, we've received comments from, and this speaks to an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8498)|
| 2:21:45| Councilman Wallace had earlier, and I think he understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| We've received comments from people who live in a home that's zoned industrial now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8508)|
| 2:21:53| that are thanking us because we've changed their designation to residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8513)|
| 2:21:57| because now they can get a loan on their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| They're no longer considered a non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| You know, do we take this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| a won opportunity in 60 years to continue mistakes that were made 60 years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8525)|
| 2:22:10| Or do we correct them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8530)|
| 2:22:11| I can't, as a professional, tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| recommend that we continue some of the mistakes we made in zoning in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| I can't, as a professional, come up with a way that we amend our whole code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8538)|
| 2:22:24| bring it into the 21st century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| and not change one designation of zoning on a piece of property in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8546)|
| 2:22:32| You're, as the City Council, are able and charged with keeping things exactly the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8552)|
| 2:22:39| As a professional who was charged with developing a code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| that will take this city into the 21st century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| address the issues we have now with development, I cannot recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| Well, I mean, I guess, I mean, just in my experience, the rezoning of one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| I mean, we have set up here for over hours discussing one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8576)|
| 2:23:02| You know, and so when you talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| I don't know how many parcels are significantly changed in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| I mean, that's, you know, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| And parcels have been significantly changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8591)|
| 2:23:14| but they've been changed to address the current use of those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| the development pattern, and to comply with 21st century code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8598)|
| 2:23:23| and to direct development in the way that the plans and policies of this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8603)|
| 2:23:28| have said that they need to be directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| Of the 350 people whose calls were responded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| less than 1% had a question or had any issue with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8614)|
| 2:23:39| Way less than 1% of those had any issue with the zoning of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| We've taken several calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| We've changed the map to reflect the zoning people want for their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| And they, I think, those folks have an understanding that what we are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| closely matches the current zoning and or the current use of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8635)|
| 2:24:03| Anyway, that's, you know, I think as we look at the map, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8643)|
| 2:24:08| it's just there's just so many parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| I mean, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| There's almost 74,000 properties, and each of them has a new designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| because we don't have the zoning classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| and the new code that we have in the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| We have very similar designations, and we have designations and standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8663)|
| 2:24:29| that more closely match the way those properties are developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8669)|
| 2:24:33| And we have a very liberal, nonconforming use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| and nonconforming structure provisions in the new code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| that would allow something that doesn't meet the new code to continue indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8678)|
| 2:24:47| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| I just want to make a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| I think what Marshall was looking at is our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| because we live in the same neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| There are single-family homes in our neighborhood zoned for R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8695)|
| 2:24:58| They're not multiplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| So my neighborhood's meeting on Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| and if they have commentary, that leadership and board needs to make their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| And some of that's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| As you've heard, we've heard we need to make opportunities for small-scale multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| We tried to find places where it appeared looking at drive-by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8714)|
| 2:25:19| looking at the maps, looking at surrounding uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8719)|
| 2:25:23| There are opportunities for redevelopment and more multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8723)|
| 2:25:29| Again, we're a diverse community with diverse comments and interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| and trying to meet all those goals and address all those comments is challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| And we're still making revisions to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| And we have acknowledged and have written in a provision that will be in the next draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| that in a year, people can come and apply at no fee for a zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8747)|
| 2:25:54| a rezoning to a zoning similar to the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| Right, but some zoning, it's not about the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| It's also about the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| So if the neighborhood may not want that zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| then the neighborhood has to get the council member to rezone the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| against the property owner's wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| I mean, that's where it gets challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| So it's not just about the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| I can think of very few cases, and I could be mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| where we went to R and 4 from an existing single-family designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| Most of the cases, it was taking it from R2, which is 24 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| or industrial, which doesn't even permit residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| to a residential designation that permits maybe 20 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8792)|
| 2:26:36| Even though it theoretically permits 20 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8796)|
| 2:26:40| it may be challenging to get 20 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| I think one of the challenges that everyone has, they have this ideal of they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8804)|
| 2:26:49| Right now, they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| They may be moving to here or about here, but they were never here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| You know, in your neighborhood, they may be upset because there's something R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8815)|
| 2:26:59| But currently, it's R2, which is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8827)|
| 2:27:08| Well, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| But that's what gives me heartburn is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| you look at every parcel in every neighborhood, you know, and some of these are big changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| And so, you know, yes, I mean, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| If I was rezoning the whole city parcel by parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| probably I would recommend a lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| But to me, that wasn't this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| This process was about the code and lot size and setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| But you can't separate the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| You have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8855)|
| 2:27:36| I know that there's no same code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| I mean, we're still in a Euclidean system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| We still have residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| I mean, it's pretty similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| I mean, it's not that different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| We've tried in most cases to assign those very similar zoning designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8865)|
| 2:27:50| There are some cases where we've changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8870)|
| 2:27:53| But in most cases, it's either acknowledging the character of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8873)|
| 2:27:59| or the neighborhood or the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| or applying a better zone that better reflects that character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8882)|
| 2:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8889)|
| 2:28:10| And we're still receiving comments on the map and making the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| and we'll continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| I think we were kind of taking a straw poll about the timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| and so I just wanted to comment on that, that I'm ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8901)|
| 2:28:26| I think that this is the conversation will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8906)|
| 2:28:31| We're going to have some consternation probably until the very end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| and even after it's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| I would like to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| I know I've been talking with Gerald and with Amy about making sure that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8918)|
| 2:28:42| Stakeholder Advisory Committee continues to meet with some very specific goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8922)|
| 2:28:49| that need to be met around some of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| reviewing the areas where there's disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8932)|
| 2:28:58| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8938)|
| 2:28:59| I think we have been about this for almost two years now, a little over two years actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8939)|
| 2:29:04| and that we as a council, each one of us is familiar with this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8944)|
| 2:29:08| and whatever comes out in the next edition of this, we now know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8948)|
| 2:29:13| because we have had input into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| and we have heard all those comments over the three workshops we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8955)|
| 2:29:20| It's time, in my opinion, to go ahead and address the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8960)|
| 2:29:24| Yes, there will be further adjustments down the road, year after next year and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8964)|
| 2:29:30| just like in the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8970)|
| 2:29:35| I guess we have three people that would like to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8975)|
| 2:29:39| Let me, for clarity, say I think if I accurately echo what Councilmember Berto was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8979)|
| 2:29:47| I'm not asking for a three-month delay on voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8987)|
| 2:29:50| I'm saying if we don't get the next draft until, like we've got a lot of proposed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| and a lot of questions that we have, it's like, oh, that's going to be changed in the next draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| And, Gerald, I understand the pressure of there was a lot of discussion about whether we would get the next draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=8999)|
| 2:30:05| before we met, and then when we ask questions, it's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| We need a good 14 days or something to look at and compare and contrast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9009)|
| 2:30:15| We have communities and neighborhoods who have said it was such and such in Version 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9015)|
| 2:30:20| it was such and such in Version 3, and then I woke up and it went the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9020)|
| 2:30:25| And they just need a chance to be able to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| And many of us have full-time jobs on top of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| This is not my full-time job, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| I'll take some time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| I'll get leave without pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| I'll figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| But we need a fair amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9038)|
| 2:30:39| It doesn't have to be three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| But, I mean, it can't be you've got a week, Lauren, you've got seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| Just go bunker down, and you guys out there, bunker down, and we're voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9044)|
| 2:30:50| I just don't think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| I would echo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| I'm not saying, I didn't ask for the straw poll here because I think we should have a three-month delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9058)|
| 2:31:03| or, you know, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9063)|
| 2:31:06| But I think the point is that we don't know when the final draft is going to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| And are you comfortable with being able to review the final draft in two weeks or 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9071)|
| 2:31:18| And so what my point was is let's make sure we have at least 30 days from when the final draft comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9078)|
| 2:31:25| for us to review and to meet with our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9085)|
| 2:31:29| If I have two weeks, how am I going to meet with all my constituents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| I don't know how I'm going to pull that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| So I think minimum 30 days, I think that's a good compromise here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| Well, we may, and this may or may not be a good suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| but we may just leave the proposed schedule as it is and see when we get that final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9104)|
| 2:31:51| We may get it sooner than we think and then make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| I would like to go ahead and act on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| We have, like I said, dealt with it for so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| that I think all of my colleagues are very well aware of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9121)|
| 2:32:06| I understand the sensitivity with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9126)|
| 2:32:10| So, Gerald, that kind of throws it right at you to get that draft to us as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9130)|
| 2:32:17| That's out of my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9137)|
| 2:32:18| Oh, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9138)|
| 2:32:19| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| And you explained that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9140)|
| 2:32:21| And Councilman Roberto expressed that the consultants were retained for a time schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9141)|
| 2:32:27| that said this was going to end in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| We've made plans to lead, author this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9150)|
| 2:32:33| It's out of town, out of the country right now, and won't be back until the 16th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9153)|
| 2:32:41| I think hearing the, I know we're torn in different directions, pushed in different directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9161)|
| 2:32:48| but maybe the 14th, a workshop to review the new draft and explain it, go over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9168)|
| 2:32:56| and then set a date for a reasonable date for adoption or action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9176)|
| 2:33:03| Get the sense of the Council, and that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9183)|
| 2:33:06| I just, you know, if I were drafting this, I had nothing else to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9186)|
| 2:33:11| I could probably get it to you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| But someone else has the template, and it's their duty, and I have lots of other duties to do as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9193)|
| 2:33:23| including reviewing the map to find places where we put RN4 instead of where we put R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9203)|
| 2:33:29| We'll go over this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| And for the public, I want them to know that map comments are still being taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9213)|
| 2:33:39| and comments on the text itself so that we please try to get those in so we can wrap it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9219)|
| 2:33:45| and get the final draft to you in a reasonable time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9229)|
| 2:33:50| And I would echo exactly what Mr. Green just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| I know some of you have visited with Mr. Green and made your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| and I know there are going to be some more made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| So, please, if you have comments, if you have concerns, if you have changes you want to be made, please meet with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9246)|
| 2:34:07| That will conclude our discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| We now have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| And given the time, it's 8.20, 8.19, we have ten people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9251)|
| 2:34:18| Normally, we allow five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| I would suggest we limit that to three minutes or we're going to be here for a good while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| Is there agreement on that on council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9269)|
| 2:34:30| So, first on the list is Elizabeth Rowland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9270)|
| 2:34:37| Oh, you're still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9277)|
| 2:34:38| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9278)|
| 2:34:39| If you would please give us your name and address, then you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9279)|
| 2:34:44| And the three minutes is on the screen right behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9284)|
| 2:34:48| Elizabeth Rowland, 615 Balsam Drive, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9288)|
| 2:34:55| I'm a steering team member of the Knox County Democratic Party Progressive Action Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| as well as a member of SOCOM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| And I am here today to ask City Council and the Planning Commission to not make any further changes to the RECO draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9301)|
| 2:35:08| that could negatively impact the availability of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| The RECO text draft four and map draft three are very close to an acceptable compromise document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9312)|
| 2:35:19| But today I heard some potential changes that concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| Number one, we believe that we need more RN three and four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9323)|
| 2:35:30| and particularly more RN four if RN two and three are going to be downgraded by increasing duplex lot size minimums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9330)|
| 2:35:41| The RN three and four are crucial for allowing more missing middle and workforce housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9341)|
| 2:35:47| and we desperately need that in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| Number two, we support ADUs and would ask to not make them a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9349)|
| 2:35:57| and to reduce setbacks to make development of ADUs more viable in neighborhoods with smaller lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9357)|
| 2:36:07| Again, ADUs are a good option for potential affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9367)|
| 2:36:12| We have some detailed recommendations on those in our past comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| Number three, please do not increase duplex lot size minimums to 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9375)|
| 2:36:22| and don't make it special use either for RN two and three, and certainly not both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9382)|
| 2:36:28| because, again, duplexes are a crucial source of missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9388)|
| 2:36:34| And when you increase the lot sizes, it really makes it unworkable to even develop duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9394)|
| 2:36:40| and then where are we going to have our missing middle housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| I would also like to discuss from a bigger pictures perspective how zoning can impact housing affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9405)|
| 2:36:54| Some have said in the past RECODE meetings that RECODE has nothing to do with affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9414)|
| 2:36:59| but we believe that RECODE and zoning most certainly do impact affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9419)|
| 2:37:05| and availability of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| In basic economics 101, we learn when supply goes up while demand stays the same, prices go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9428)|
| 2:37:16| Conversely, if demand goes up while supply stays the same, prices go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| When it comes to housing, zoning can impact the supply and demand equation most obviously on the supply side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9441)|
| 2:37:28| If you've got 20 square blocks of a city for which zoning says you can only build single family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9448)|
| 2:37:34| one per block, then you get 20 housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9454)|
| 2:37:37| If you have 100 people seeking housing and only 20 housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9457)|
| 2:37:41| then prices for those housing units are going to be pushed higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9461)|
| 2:37:45| So zoning can impact housing prices and affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9465)|
| 2:37:49| We must recognize that when we put additional restrictions on multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| Ms. Rowland, you've run out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9473)|
| 2:37:56| Okay, can I just finish my sentence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| Please finish your sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9478)|
| 2:37:59| We must recognize that when we put additional restrictions on multifamily housing construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| density and lot sizes, those restrictions make it harder to expand housing supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9484)|
| 2:38:09| and therefore make it easier for housing prices to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9493)|
| 2:38:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9494)|
| 2:38:15| Next is Mary English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9495)|
| 2:38:20| You know, I resent that you all cut our time down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9500)|
| 2:38:23| These are our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| Mr. Golden, you will have a chance to speak in just a few moments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9505)|
| 2:38:33| Ms. English, if you would please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9513)|
| 2:38:39| Mary English, 810 Oak Grove Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| I'm speaking on behalf of the League of Women Voters and its president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9523)|
| 2:38:48| This will be short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| It's all about having meaningful opportunities for public input and participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9529)|
| 2:38:56| So three different things, and they may sound petty, but they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| One is that right now in Article 15.2, where it talks about notice of things such as public hearings and meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9540)|
| 2:39:10| it only refers to telling where you can go to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9550)|
| 2:39:16| It does not provide information on how to submit written comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| And as we've seen from RECODE, the opportunity to submit written comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWSR3877190404?start=9561)|
