| 0:00:00| All right, Office of Sustainability is the last one listed under the Mayor's Office on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=0)|
| 0:00:25| page 2 of the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| And I'm going to be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=26)|
| 0:00:27| You guys know our history a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=27)|
| 0:00:28| I'm just going to reiterate that in 2009 to 2011, we were federally funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=28)|
| 0:00:37| We have been locally funded in 2012, which was an excellent year for us, primarily because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=37)|
| 0:00:43| we didn't have to dump and step to the federal agenda and priorities, but we can make our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=43)|
| 0:00:48| own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| And so we watched the funding shift from a federal level and a national level to more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| of a local level, and we found that foundations all across the country are very much investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=53)|
| 0:00:59| in urban sustainability issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| So in 2012, we brought in over $400,000 in unmatched resources to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=62)|
| 0:01:09| We fully anticipate these types of opportunities to continue, and we fully anticipate chasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| So that's kind of my summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| I'll take questions now if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=77)|
| 0:01:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Yeah, would you tell us a little bit about your objectives going forward, what you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| as the big picture focuses going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| In 2011, we published our first Energy and Sustainability Work Plan, and 24 of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=93)|
| 0:01:39| 33 activities are completed or are in process right now, which means that we've started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=99)|
| 0:01:47| the last 8 to 10 months compiling all of our energy data again in an effort to update our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| energy baseline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| That's your ongoing mission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| You've got new things coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| It helps us set our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| So when we see funding opportunities come up, we can say, okay, 36% of our emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| come from buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| We need building funding and we need building initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| So our data helps us set our priorities, and out of that, we're also revamping the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| plan to set goals, because we've met some of our goals, so we're setting new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| From a big picture perspective, in 2013, we've watched the office sort of start up with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| infusion of federal funds at a federal agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| We've watched it turn into a local initiative, and in 2013, we're entering it as a mature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| office with set goals and ways of getting to them and actual percentages of the carbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| that we're reducing from each activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| So we're focusing very much on transit and buildings right now, because they're our largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| contributors to air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| So when you say the word sustainability, you mean environmental improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| What do you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| Sustainability is a three-tiered stool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| It deals with economic development, social equity, and also environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| And so when we evaluate an initiative that we want to get involved with, we look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| from all three of those lenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| So we ask, does it make financial sense for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Does it make social sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Are we helping our weakest links here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| Because we're not stronger than our weakest links.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| And finally, we're asking, what does this do to impact our local environmental quality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| Are we improving it with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| So essentially, it's about the way that Knoxville grows as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| Are we growing responsibly and smart from those three perspectives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| We will move right along to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| To find Charles's budget in the handout, it's page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| And I believe he's also going to talk a little bit about risk management fund, which is page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| That's the one he's inherited, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Good morning, Mr. Vice Mayor, members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| I'm Charles Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| I am honored to represent a group of fine lawyers in the law department and a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| staff and a group of fine people in risk management these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| What we have discovered is that while we have great lawyers in the law department, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| boss is not all that good at lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| Because as I look at our budget, it's pretty much the same blooming budget we had last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| year despite all my efforts to get new carpet and better furniture and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| We don't have money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| So we're going to stick with the budget we had last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| And we'll hope to provide good legal services to the city of Knoxville with that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| I would like to explain to you that we have had a little difference in the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| since last year in that it sort of makes sense that what the law department does is it handles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=291)|
| 0:05:01| liabilities, potential liabilities from the city's point of view, claims against the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| That's what the law department does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| And what we had in risk management was a group of people with sort of different missions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| There was the benefits group of folks who were working in risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| And what we really found was that they were working on behalf of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| And our employees are not liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| They are major assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| And so in dividing that up in a more logical fashion, it seemed to make sense to put the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| claims and workers' compensation folks into a group that would be working as sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| division of the law department, which is where they used to be a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| Some of you know that in one of my previous lives, I worked in the city law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| back in the early 1980s during a World's Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| And at that period of time, risk management was a part of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| And then over time with one mayor or another, risk management got moved out of the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| and then into the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| But now risk management has come back home to the law department where it belongs, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| we're glad to have them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| As you look at our budget, you really see the only increases that are there are for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| compensation for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| There's some adjustment with regard to Westlaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| We've had to add a little money, and really we've rearranged where Westlaw is paid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| of what fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Westlaw is a very expensive thing, and if it were just up to me, it wouldn't be as expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| because I don't know how to use it as well as these young lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| But these young lawyers can't practice law without computer research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| And frankly, they're not able to compete with their peers in the law if they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| have that asset and you want them to have it, because then they do the research and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| they tell me what they find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| So that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| I get the benefit of having that computer research and not having to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| And so we've got to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| We've got the Minitrack system in there, and that costs us a little more every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| And I think we're going to get this Minitrack system worked out so that it works well for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| you all and works well for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| So that's really the only adjustments in our budget that you will find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| And in the risk management portion, I have Kirk Ryden here from risk management to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| any questions you may have with regard to risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Gary Easties is not able to be with us today because he's out traveling somewhere learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| something or either teaching or learning something to help us with our claims handling for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| So Kirk is here to answer any questions you may have with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| I will tell you that workers' comp is down and claims are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| And that's always a good sign in the current economic and litigation climate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| Any questions from anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=489)|
| 0:08:09| Hey, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| You brought in the tax lawyer into your group, the property tax lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| And how are we doing with catching up with some of those arrearages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| Are we getting closer to being current?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| Because I know that that was a great sort of coup to find this guy buried in the stack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| And you got him kind of teamed up with your guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| We're going very well with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| And we've recently had a tax sale where we had some adjustments to the state law to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| us to do some things that allow both the county government and the city government to forgive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| each other's taxes when the property was upside down and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| And we've recently had a tax sale that, frankly, brought in a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| money than we anticipated that it might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| So we are moving forward with those little parcels of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Most of those parcels were purchased, as you might imagine, by adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| I am told that maybe from time to time when we were selling that property, we got into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| a little bidding war between adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| From the city of Knoxville's perspective, that's a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| So it is moving well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| And we are continuing to decrease the amount of unpaid property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=564)|
| 0:09:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=570)|
| 0:09:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Not anybody who wants to talk to their lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=577)|
| 0:09:37| We will move into civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| Civil service is page 16 of the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| I'm probably going to say very little about my actual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| It's very uninteresting, small, and we've pretty well held with the same budget for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| The only thing I did want to point out is it's been one of my goals since becoming the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| director to make our department more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| And since then, we've gone from 15 staff, and this year we actually reduced down a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| little farther where I've taken the department to 10 staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| And I've done that voluntarily as we've been able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| And I wanted to mention that one of the things you guys funded last year, we invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| some money to go online with our applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| And while we're still working through some hiccups on that, it has been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| It has tremendously increased our efficiency, and that's what allowed me to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| reduce an additional position, which was one of the things I had agreed up front we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| would probably be able to do in exchange for paying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| So we actually gave some positions to benefits, the new benefits department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=648)|
| 0:10:55| They needed them and we didn't, so we made that transition with this year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| I was going to focus my comments more on the class comp issues, because those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| probably what I bring more to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| We have the class comp ordinance before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| Just to give you a very brief summary on the salary survey, you guys should have all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| gotten a copy of that, and it's on the intranet if you need to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| We usually send that to about a little over 100 participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| That list was developed by Mercer back when we did the comprehensive survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| We got 45 respondents this year, representing 13 states, and we send those two states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| throughout the southeast and the midwest, so it's a pretty big group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| About one-third of those were from Tennessee, with about 30 of them being from the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| 12 states that responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| And on this year's survey, one thing I wanted to point out, because it is a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| I know when employee groups come and speak to you guys, the data they have sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| looks different than the data I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| When I get that survey data, I actually do my own analysis to make a determination on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| what, if any, changes to bring to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| And when I do that, what I'm looking at, for general government, you'll notice in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| the survey itself, you just have responses for the job classes that we survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| I actually aggregate those in my own data so that I can get sort of a representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| of what that pay grade looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| So all of the jobs within a given pay grade, I'll aggregate that data for my own purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| to see, based on that data, what would be that midpoint if you group them all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| And how do we look relative to that midpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| On general government, we don't make any adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| We actually, I actually take the survey midpoint and compare it to our own midpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| to see what percent of difference we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| On Uniformed, I do the same thing for each rank that we survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| The difference there is, I actually adjust that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| If you remember, back when we did Mercer, Mercer gave us a 5% benefit, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| on Uniformed, given the richness of their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| So their benefit package actually sort of added 5% to our compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| And it was their recommendation, and that's how they did the survey when they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| So that's why the number looks a little different, and sometimes employees aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=798)|
| 0:13:22| sure why my number looks different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| I'm actually giving it that 5% adjustment until we have a reason not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| So it actually gets a 5% adjustment before I make that comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| And then again, I look to see what's the percent of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| What I'm looking for, ideally, is that we're going to be within about 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| To me, if it's high or low, 5%, I see that much fluctuation from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| So I don't want to make a knee-jerk reaction and change something based on something smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| than 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| When we start getting differences that are greater than 5%, then I watch for a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| If that continues over a multi-year period, that's when I suggest an adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| So just want you to sort of know my thinking process and how I'm looking at that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| why some things come to you and others don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| So in looking at it this year, fire, we look very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| Fire looked great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| We only had one rank that I didn't consider to be in the acceptable range, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| Assistant Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| I've been watching fire for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| We actually had a downward trend for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| We made some targeted adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| We gave some additional increases in fire last year that absolutely reversed that trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| And right now, the only one that's still lower than I would like to see it is Assistant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| But we actually cut that difference in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| So I do expect we're talking to the Chief about some additional changes to the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| in fire that we're going to explore this year, possibly including some new ranks so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| that we mirror other municipalities more closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Most of them have about two ranks more than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| And I think that if we do that, you'll have more promotional opportunities on the lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| end, and it'll, over time, get those salaries up once you get to that higher end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| So we already have a plan in place to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| So I didn't make any recommendations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Police, we look great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| We're starting to dip a little low on the upper ranks there as well, Captain and Deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=916)|
| 0:15:16| But it's a new trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| It's not something I've seen in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| So it's something I would want to see a multi-year trend before we made a suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| to adjust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| General Government is the only place I made a recommended change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| We were low on pay grades one and two, lower than I would like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| So we actually did, I put in about a 5% increase on pay grade one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| The cost of that's a little, given the incumbent employees that would have to be raised to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| the new minimum, is a little under $40,000 in base salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| And that, over time, that'll kick up pay grade two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| So I didn't make any recommendations for pay grade two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| So that's why the only structure change you see is just for pay grade one in General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| Government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| And that's about a 5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| So right now, the survey looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| It's showing us almost on everything to be in the acceptable range where we'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| I did want to make a couple of comments about the proposal to do another comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| survey, go out to a consultant this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| We had made a commitment to do that approximately every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| I think we're actually in our sixth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| And I think it's very important that we stick with that and that at least every five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| or six years we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| So it's been about six years since we did Mercer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| It would allow us to ensure we're still on target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Our survey is smaller in scale than what a consultant can do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| They have a broader reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| They can get more data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| They can get better data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| And they can do a benefits valuation, which is something we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| So it's a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| And we still, we have a few hiccups left over from Mercer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| It created a few inequities we didn't expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| And this would give us an opportunity to look at those and see if any of those need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| corrected and get some recommendations on how to correct them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| And it would also give us another chance to see if that 5% benefit valuation for Uniformed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| is still holding or whether we need to take a second look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| And it also, I'm hopeful that it might even help us with that development of the new fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| structure that we're considering trying to do this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| So those are the only comments I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Oh, we've got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| On your survey, is this just of other like public entities or do we involve ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| with the private sector and try to get some comparative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| We try to get private data, but private companies will not typically disclose their data because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| And they consider it, you know, it hurts them, I guess, in the competitive world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| They don't want their competitors to know what they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| We actually only had, we did have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Usually we don't get any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Barge Wagner actually responded to this year's survey, so we were able to get a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| of private data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| But we always, we do try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| We include about 10 private entities, but they rarely respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| Well, when we go with a survey company, do they get some of that private data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| They do have a better ability to get that private data because they have, if it's similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| to what Mercer did, you know, and I can't speak for every consultant, but modeling the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| way Mercer did it, they sent out a custom survey for us to the, and that's where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| group that we send ours to came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| We're using the same group that they used because it was very representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| We sort of sat right in the middle, gave us a really good representative group to compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| ourselves to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| So we've continued to use the same list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| But they also have databases full of data because companies hire them to do surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| So if a private company, they have multitudes of private companies that hire them, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| then have all of those companies' data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| So we had a second part that Mercer brought to the table in that they had this wealth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| of data they already had, and they then matched our jobs to that data they already had, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| did bring in a lot of private data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Yes, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Yes, I was asking this earlier of, I guess, maybe Jim York, but let me try it on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| Do you see the possibility of, well, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| The wage portion of our budget that includes wages and fringes and pensions and all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| things is the lion's share of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| It's over 109 million out of 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| Do you see any possibility of having differentials to automatic increases so that, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:49| if we took people that earned under 40 or 45,000 and gave them a set cost of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| increase that we might look at people in the higher pay scales as getting more of a discretionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1194)|
| 0:20:02| adjustment based on, you know, available revenue, performance bonuses, whatever else we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| but somehow take everything out of autopilot because the forecast going forward for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| next five years is that money might get tighter in terms of flat line property and sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1214)|
| 0:20:22| and everything else, and we want to use our powder where it will do the most good and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| help the people best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Do you see that as inconsistent with what you do in looking at classifications or ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| of compensating our employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| I'd say that probably would be something you would see in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| As far as whether or not other municipalities do that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| It's definitely something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| It would be very easy to have MTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| They're really great about doing any kind of little survey like that we need and kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| of checking with everybody else in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| It would be very easy to find out if anyone else does something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| MTAS is plugged into all the other municipalities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| And they have a database, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| We have a really good contact, Rick Stokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| He kind of wears two hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| He works for MTAS, but he's also a very active member of the Tennessee Personnel Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| Association, and so on both of those levels, he's able to get us a lot of good data, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| it's something we could ask him to just see if anyone else does anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Have you seen anything in the public sector work, whether it's in Tennessee or Kentucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| or elsewhere, where they have temporary freezes of adjustments or COLA adjustments or other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| things where budgetary constraints are affecting the municipality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| Because the option is to go out and either borrow money or tax somebody or cut services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| We haven't looked at it this year, but I know that a couple of years ago, I think maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| two years in a row, we actually did do that survey with many of our peers to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| If memory serves, probably about half of them were freezing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| They were freezing their cost of living adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| Just to make ends meet, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| That's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| That's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Have you looked around other areas to see whether employees could put in an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| percentage point in their pension plan or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| That I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Six percent put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| That's not something I've heard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Not familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Not in the public sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Mm-mm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| I'm not saying no one does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| I'm unaware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Ms. Hatfield, the program where the students come in, are we still doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Could you tell us a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| We're in the application process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| We're getting applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| We got a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Do you know how many departments have signed on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| Almost every department has agreed to host an intern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| We're taking applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| I think the interviews, I think we usually do those in early June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| We try to bring the students to work for a month in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| We actually got permission to double the hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| In the past, they've only worked 10 hours a week, which was really difficult to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| something meaningful for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Everybody here knows coming to the city county building for a few hours is, you spend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| much time trying to get in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| If we could give them more hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| We actually are going to give them 20 hours this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| We're hopeful that that's going to be a permanent program that we can continue for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| It's been very rewarding for us and for the employees, for the students that have participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Just two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| One, for the comparative study, you do an RFP for that, and then is Mercer is a company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| that would, they'd quote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| We would hope that they, you know, just my thought is that because they have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| done it for us in the past, they've sort of, they already know what we do, and they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| already got, you know, they've already developed a custom survey for us, and so, yeah, ideally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| you know, they would be interested in at least vying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| One of the concerns last year in the pension discussions were that if we change this, change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| the pension plan dramatically, it would put us at a competitive disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| Has there been enough time to see if that is true or not, or have you seen any pushback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| from new applicants so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Honestly, I don't know that our applicants know the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| I'd say where that would really come in more would be in retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| I don't think we're really going to see it in applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| People looking for a job are looking for a job, and if you've got a job, they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| to apply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| What we do notice is there's, that five-year vesting, it was a hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| I mean, it really was a hook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| I've heard a lot of employees that have the skill sets to go virtually anywhere say, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| was once I got that fifth year in, I was hooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Now I can't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| And that's what I, you know, I would expect to see, that maybe we won't have that hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| and we won't be able to retain them as long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| But right now, our turnover is significantly lower than any of our peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| We've been hanging around three, the low three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| I think even the state average is probably around six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| So we're, our turnover is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| So far, we haven't seen any change in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Yeah, are you seeing in any of the more professional type positions, whether it's engineers or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| lawyers, whatever, some area where you can't compete or you're losing talent that you really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:49| want to keep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| In other words, is there a problem that you see in the more skilled workers, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| No more so than, we've always had a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| You know, just really one that sticks in my mind because it's recent is engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| We've always had a harder time recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| The higher the position, the harder it is to recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| But so far, we've always been very lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| All you need is one applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| If you get that one good applicant and there's one good qualified person that you can hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| and they want the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| But for example, for traffic engineering chief, I think we had, we had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| John Hunter was, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| And John Hunter, you know, my understanding is that we, he got a job offer that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| was no way we could compete with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| So that's why we lost him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| And then trying to replace him, I believe we had to post it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| It was open for an extremely long period of time and we still, I think we might have only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| gotten three applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| It's a very difficult job to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| On the flip side, do you see professionals out there that might be nearing the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| their career and they would bring some wealth of knowledge but they really don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| travel around the country and be on the road all the time when they're looking for a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| secure kind of local job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| In other words, are you getting skill sets that come in looking for a municipal job rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| than a whirlwind tour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| That's what we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| And it's funny, that's actually, you know, the new traffic engineering chief is someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| that had retired from the New York, he worked with New York DOT and had retired and moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| down here and still wanted to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| So he brings a really valuable skill set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| So yes, we do tend to make up for maybe what we lack in pay in working conditions and environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| An engineer in the private sector is expected to bring in clients, probably going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| working 60, 70, 80 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| So certainly they make more but the working environment is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| We're going to attract people who...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| They might want to be buying leisure time instead of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| We're going to attract people who, you know, value their family time and want to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| and do a more reasonable schedule and have more time at home with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| That's the trade-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| And don't travel and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| So you're pursuing that angle as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Alec, Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| For this fund, if you'll look on page 27 of the handout or pages 87 and 88 under the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:19| detail tab, it's fund 503, public assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:29| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:42| Greg McKay with the Public Assembly Facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| Thanks for having me this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| As you well know, I'm relatively new at this, so I'm relying on the help of Mr. York, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| He'll be here if you have any questions about the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| And what we're doing this year is, you know, we're trying to do what we can to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| revenue at both places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| We're looking at having possibly an outdoor venue at the Coliseum sometime late in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| summer, early in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| We also are doing our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| We have several vacancies at both facilities that we're using part-time people when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| can, particularly at the ticket booths, because we just don't have the demand that we used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:24| to because of the Internet and ticketing concerns with Ticketmaster and things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| And we're just, you know, making do with less as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| So if you've got any questions, I'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| I'd just like to say I appreciate what you've done turning to social media to let folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| know what's going on at the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| I think that's real important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| You know, we've spent a lot of money in those facilities over the past four or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| and I think it's good that people see, you know, that there is action out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| Because beforehand, we really didn't know a whole lot was going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| So I applaud you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Well, you know, people do look at Facebook, and they do look at kids look at Instagram,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| and those are free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| All you've got to do is make the effort to put up information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| So we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| We go around and take pictures of people that come to our events and put them on Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| and put them on Instagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| And like I said, it's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| It's free advertising for us, and it lets people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| One of the biggest surprises to me is how much stuff we have at the Coliseum and at Chilhowee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| It's like every two or three days, there's a dance, there's a graduation, there's a concert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| there's a football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Don't forget there's a roller derby coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| I was going to get my skates out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Are we using and are we getting help from like Visit Knoxville and other entities within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| Knoxville to help market your stuff so that we get the word out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| I mean, they've got a website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| We have a website here at the public assemblies as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| but they have contacts that they spread the word through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Are they helping you market your facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| We're in touch with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| We speak with them often, and there was a crew that came over, I want to say last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| to the Coliseum that is doing a video that we can put on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| and that you can e-mail to people too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| People need to see the facilities, and if we get a request for information from somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| we can just e-mail them a 60-second video of what the Coliseum looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| And it's something that was done professionally, not something done with an iPhone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| so it's going to look good when it's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| It's a lot better than reading a booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| You get to look at it, kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Exactly, a PDF or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| People want to see pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| They want to see something visual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| And I think that they're planning one for Chihuahua Park too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| And they do help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| You know, people call in with an event, and I think what they do, I don't want to speak for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| but they try to figure out where to put them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| You know, some things are best at the Tennessee Theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| and really there's no better place to do a car show or something like that than Chihuahua Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| So, yes, to answer your question, they have been a big help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| Okay, and one other topic is we've got a number of old facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| Do you see capital problems, capital improvement needs going downstream that are kind of cropping up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:10| I mean, where are we looking forward in terms of our buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| I know, you know, from time to time we talk about things like, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| replacing the pipes under, you know, an ice skating floor and all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| Tell us a little bit about what you see as capital demands on the system that you run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| Hey, Nick, if I could direct you to page 13 of 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Is that the $195,000 you're talking about or the $700,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Page 13 of 14, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| And it also shows which projects have been funded in 2012, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| So he's had several, and that $700,000 is actually being funded from the 503 fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| Right, but those are the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about the facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| and how we are looking to keep them sort of working and good to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| Sure, yeah, and that's something I spend a lot of time thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| and talking with people about, too, is the future of both facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| They're aging, to say the least, aging but beloved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| And the Coliseum, just to let you know, that's for the floor to take out the concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| and put the pipes in that carry the brine that freezes the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| It's been talked about for 10 years or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| Yes, and it's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| The concern, of course, is their original equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| their cast iron that was put in there sometime in 1959 or 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| And when they break, we're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| So having said that, I want to make sure that you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| we won't be able to do it this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| It will be next summer when we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| We have things booked at the Coliseum this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| And it takes 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| You have to let it cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| You can't just put it because the pipes are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| You've got to let the concrete cure longer than you would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Because it would stress it to get it cold and hot and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| To be done correctly, it takes 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| So we're planning that for 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| And then that's something that's kind of preventative, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| getting ahead of the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Because if it breaks in the middle of the hockey season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| then we're going to have trouble, especially the hockey team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| There has been talk about renovating the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| It is getting older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| It was built in 1960, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| And it's been maintained very well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| A lot of the systems are new due to the energy efficiency efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| from the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| But, you know, the bathrooms are older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| They're original equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| The building is very solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| It was built to last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| But you might want to look in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| You know, now in the next ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| it may be time to put money into the Coliseum if you want to continue to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| that size or maybe a little bit bigger of an arena in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| Is some engineering group looking at that for you in terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| No, I think the best way to do that would be sometime in the future to fund a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| real feasibility study about possibly expanding it, upgrading it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| just see what the market is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| And that's not just something you'd sit around and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| You'd hire a company to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| You know, maybe we could partner with the county or with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| and get some money to look at the feasibility of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| You know, I'm talking in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| I don't think this is something that's going to happen in the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Right, but you don't wait until it falls down, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| You kind of look forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| You know, because you've got to think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| what are we going to be facing with in the year 2025?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| What's the Coliseum going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| What's going to be at Chilhowee Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| And those are both things that, you know, I spend a lot of time thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| The future at Chilhowee, I mean, you know, you've got to wonder, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| you know, the venues it holds now, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| are they going to be viable 20 years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| car shows and agricultural fairs, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| And it's a beautiful piece of property, 81 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| in the middle of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| If you've never been out there and climbed up that hill and looked over the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| it's just a fantastic place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| All right, let's move on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you, Mr. McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| I want to ask you about as far as income or projects, wrestling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| professional wrestling that used to be at the Coliseum and also at Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| Is that something that you've looked at or thought about in terms of bringing that in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| or would that be profitable or not profitable, or have you thought about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| I have thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Talked to several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| There's a difference of opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Some people kind of think that that train has kind of left the station as far as wrestling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| For a while there, everybody had wrestling, and now you don't see so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| There is a show planned for later this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Lando, Landau, Terry, or the other one is going to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| Smoky Mountain Wrestling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| I don't know the name of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Well, it's no, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| But they're going to be bringing a show, so, you know, we're looking at reviving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| That's a possibility, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| Just wondering about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| I know that's a big deal in a lot of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| Is Ron and Don Ryan, are they still around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Wiley Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| We're open to any suggestions, you know, that you can think of to fill up the Jacob Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| and to fill up the Homer Hamilton, probably the most unused venue in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Well, I just want to dovetail exactly what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| and I think that the Coliseum needs a feasibility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| and I think this is something that you need to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| What are we, where are we going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| We're putting in, and the same with Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| We just spent a million dollars out there in our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| And what is the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| What is, what can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| I see, you know, you all are putting in the $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| But it's not good if you're going to, you know, if you're going to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| And, you know, so I think that's one thing we need to get with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| and I would encourage you all to just come back with a feasibility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| and make that a priority and also have a vision for the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| Knoxville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| Okay, page 28 on the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| Number one in your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| It also goes on page 29 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| Or you can go to your budget detail pages starting with 91 through 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:38| Good morning, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| I'm Mary Bogert with the Knoxville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| It is a pleasure to be with you this morning to present the Knoxville Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| fiscal budget for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| The story is, for the most part, actually before I get into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| let me tell you where we are this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| We do plan to make our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Right now we are slotted to be a little ahead of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| We've had a very good year thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| April, as a matter of fact, will go down in the history of the busiest month in the history of the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| We did the most food and beverage revenue we've ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| So we have certainly been very busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| As far as the budget request for next fiscal year, it is $1,397,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| That's relatively flat to the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| It's about a $27,000 increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| The majority of that is an increase in utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| The good news is we are booking more business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| We have 208 events on the calendar for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| We have 231 on the calendar for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| So we're doing more business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| It's just the margins of income to the center do shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| So we're very, very pleased to be able to present what we think is very good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| As far as capital funding requests, we have one request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| It is a $70,000 phone switch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| The phone switch that we currently have at the center was the original piece of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| It is also the backup for the city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| So that's important to note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| We've been working with the city IT department to determine exactly what those needs would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| And it is that $70,000 fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Currently, right now, the phone system works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| But if it were to go down, the technology is no longer supported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| and it would render the convention center, as far as being able to have we could answer the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| so we could hang them up, but we would not have voicemail, the ability to forward any of those capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| And so that is the one capital funding request that we have for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| Let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| I was reading with interest this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| I know the new convention center in Nashville opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| and I think they had made a commitment of a million room nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| And they reached that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| So with that in mind, I mean, you know, how is that going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Does that really affect us here, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| I mean, it seems like that's another tier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| It's a different market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| We really don't go after the same types of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Well, I shouldn't say the same types, the same size of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Tennessee is an altogether different market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| If anything, it will probably bring more to the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| So we look at it as a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| We'll be bringing more people to the state of Tennessee that will then perhaps look at a NOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| So you may not have considered this region in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| I was wondering, do you see a change in the marketplace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| In other words, do gas prices affect travel so you're having more local or regional activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| What's happening at your horizon as you see business shift and change with the economy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Well, the things that we've noticed, we've actually done very well as far as convention business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| I mean, we haven't lost any business due to the downturn in the economy over the last three years that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2517)|
| 0:42:05| If anything, what's come into our market more so is the association business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| That's the drivable business that comes to the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| So we've done quite well with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| The trends that we've seen in our industry are more so how the meeting planners are reacting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| They are waiting to book the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| We're seeing less and less of events booking three and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| Shorter horizons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Shorter horizons between booking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Very short-term bookings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| We've actually booked business in the year for the year on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| Are they looking for deals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| I mean, it's sort of like a price line or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| They know that a center is going to be much more aggressive to book that piece of business in a filler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| kind of a filler date scenario than they are to sit on those dates years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| They get better travel deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| They get better hotel deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| And they get better space deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| And so it is a trend that we're seeing in our industry as that booking cycle has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| It makes it more difficult for us to be able to forecast going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| I mean, just to give you an example, this year, you know, I may have mentioned earlier that we're going to make our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| We actually plan to beat our budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| We booked two significantly sized pieces of business in the year for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| And that's enabled us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| So it's becoming much more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| But you can take a guess at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Oh, I think I'm going to have $100,000 worth of feed in or walk-in revenue happen in this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| It may not happen that month, but we're seeing it happen in other months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| So it is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| It's just hard to predict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Is the downtown improvement process helping you to get business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| In other words, you've got something to do here other than go to your meeting and you want to go noodle around the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Everything that the city is doing and focused on is helping our initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| It makes it much, much easier to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| It's a beautiful product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| We're certainly very proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| What we find is once we get them here, they don't want to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| And there's something very genuine about the way people are treated, the hospitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| But it's actually beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| It's wonderful to go to Market Square now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| It's wonderful to go out and be able to enjoy our parks, everything that we're doing with the greenways and downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| I'd love to see the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| That would be another attraction to sell the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| Can you tell them that south Knoxville is open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| Open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| Open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Always good to see Mr. Conaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| Bean counter, extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| I guess that's up to me now, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| So if you all want to move to our budget, you can go to page 28, I mean 23, under the detail tab in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2696)|
| 0:45:06| Or if you're looking at the handout, it is page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:17| It's, again, a flat budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| We did realize a reduction in the external financial statement audit team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| We put the bid out for the external audit this year and have a new contract with new auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| And that bid came in very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| So it's a reduction of $22,000 from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| And here are the line items that make up that total, the $424,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| The only other change that I see is that we opted out last year of the National League of Cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| It's listed, but we are not participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| You need to mark that out, and I need to mark that out in the future until we decide we're going to start paying those dues again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| How much are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| How much were those before, Cindy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| $11,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| It was $11,000, right at $11,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| I never figured out what we got from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| I couldn't either, and that's why I took it out, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| So if you'll just mark through that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| And then in preparation, do you all have any other questions about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| I don't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| I'll just throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| We've got a few minutes to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| You know, me personally, I don't have, I don't, I could get to belabor the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| or I could get in a philosophical discussion about 202 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| That's part of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| I don't really see, personally, I don't see the need in continuing that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| And, you know, throw it out there for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| You know, it is $10,000 a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| It's $90,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| And we spend a lot of time managing, Melissa does, and managing our accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| and a few dollars here and a few dollars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| And I think you ought to debate whether that's something you want to keep in the budget or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| Just throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| Well, I can give you a little history on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| I mean, back when I was on council the first time, it was $40,000 per council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| And then we did away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| I think the last year I was on council, we voted it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| And then one year, then the next council brought it back at the $10,000 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| So there's been fluctuation and change in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| I just throw that out just as a historical, whatever historical value that brings council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| No, I was just going to say, George, I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| I mean, you hold the line and don't spend any of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| And whatever you end up doing with it, I guess, turning it back into community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| But, you know, there's a lot of organizations within our districts, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| we kind of have a fine-tuned feel of who needs what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| And we, you know, all those organizations that get requests from us, sure, it's discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| We have an opportunity to make a decision on who we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| But, you know, for example, like the Cerebral Palsy organization lost huge funding this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| And I felt in the district that was someone very worthy of getting a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| So I see your fiscal responsibility side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| But I think it's, you know, it does a lot of good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| That little bit of money can help certain groups go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| Councilman DelVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| I was going to agree with Councilman Campen in the sense that you find needs in some of these districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| that don't have another place to turn to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| But I think George has one point that we really should look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| There ought to be a better way to dispense these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| Maybe we're a victim of state law and whatnot, but it puts a fair amount of administrative burden on Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| And, you know, if you're given $500 for a park to buy a bench, it shouldn't take, you know, a lot of hours of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:07| But we have to ask the group to submit a lot of paperwork and, what, certifications if they've got the right status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| I know that's important under state law, but the amount of money doesn't justify the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| And if there was a way to simplify that, I don't know how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Maybe we ask our lawyers or someone if there's any way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| Or maybe there ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Or maybe $10,000 is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Maybe you say, gosh, I mean, if we had $40,000, that's what I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| I don't know, but it's very discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| And you're doing some of these are $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| I mean, you know, there's quite a bit of, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| We could maybe come up with some rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| I know when it was $40,000, I think we held it around a $500 minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| We never had a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Is there no way to get a dispensing authority that, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| once it's approved, that someone manages it differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| Or is it faulted in general order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Well, you have to draft the ordinance to appropriate the money to requisition it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| to have authorization to requisition it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| Now, once you all make a donation to a certain organization within a fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| and I have that paperwork on file, the next time someone asks me to do something for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| then all I have to do is get the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| So once they qualify, then you can just get the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| And then the next year I have to check the file to make sure that we have the audited financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| I don't ever have to go back again and get the 501C3 or C6, you know, the IRS designation letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:36| But it's just making sure that we have the financials annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| and checking the file on that and drafting the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| and then requisitioning it through finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| It's just time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Plus, a lot of you wait and want me to call and get letters and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| So if we could do it prior to budget, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| Well, there's no shame, I guess, in turning money back in if you haven't spent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Finance always loves to have money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| We'll be happy to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| Well, I have given this a lot of thought over the four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| And when someone wants $100, I'm not really sure that they're going to do a whole lot with $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| After the first year of really wrestling with some of the requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| I finally decided that it would have to be something for a capital project or a startup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| or a one-time expense for the organization, but nothing related to operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| Because year after year, some organizations request money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| which actually turns out to be operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| Dependency, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Yeah, it becomes a dependency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| And that's not something that I think is healthy for that organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| because the next person who sits on council may not be interested in that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3114)|
| 0:52:00| I don't think $10,000 is enough for us to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| At the same time, this is a real wrestling thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| This year I tried to get most of my money spent by December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| and I'm assuming that we approve the money for the next coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| Virtually all my money is going to one particular organization for helping their startup costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:29| But I think probably as a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| we don't all have the same idea about how we want to respond to the requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| And I know some organizations, I'm sure, are very offended because they don't get money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| And at the same time, others turn cartwheels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| The fact that we have a number of organizations that are not 501c3s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| then they have to find a fiscal agent to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| Yeah, that's the hard part of the logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| And, frankly, if I was an organization with a 501c3, I would run the other way as quickly as I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| simply because they have strict accounting measures for how monies they receive are dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:12| And some of the people who don't have 501c3 don't want to be bothered with those accounting practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| receipts and things, and so that also becomes an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| It's a hot potato.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| And, George, I really appreciate your bringing this up because there are some times when I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| oh, if we just didn't have this, it would be so much easier to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| And then other times I feel like, well, I can really make a difference here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| So it's not an easy answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| And let me say one thing about a startup organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| The state says that the entity has to have been in business for a full year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| and have an audited financial statement available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| and provide that prior to any funds going to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| So if you're helping somebody get, and we have helped a lot of these nonprofits get started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| but we had to do it through a fiscal agent in order to get them started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| because they didn't qualify for the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| So there's lots of, each one of them, you have to look at the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| Schools are easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| The libraries are easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| Those entities that we have routinely given money to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| just like in the mayor's community and agency grants, it's the same organizations each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| Those are fairly easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| But then when you get new entities, then you have to explain this to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| and they don't understand sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| That's where the burden comes in of kind of educating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| But, I mean, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Whatever you all decide to do is what I work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| The flip side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Okay, one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| Well, the other side of the coin is that we don't have any follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| to know really how people have actually spent the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| and if they have, in fact, spent it for what we responded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| and that's always been a bit of a disturbing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| But I don't want to have one more piece of paper that has to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| What happens is those entities are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| That's why I have to ask for their audited financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| What I get are confirmation letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| I'll get a confirmation letter from Second Harvest Food Bank saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| did you make a donation to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| What was it designated for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| So there is a checks and balance on their end that I answer those audit confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| That's another function that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| That's one more, again, that's one more piece of the workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| That's related to 202s, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| And on the audit committee, we want you looking at other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| I assume they get that in finance also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Yeah, Jim is shaking his head yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| I assume they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Yeah, I was just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| so the community action grants through the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| they have to go through the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| Yes, somebody handles those, but they pay them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| what do you do most of yours, quarterly, those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| If it's under, I think, $5,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| then we will take a look at it and see whether we pay it once at either one time payment or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:17| Anything over $5,000, we pay quarterly allotments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| Yeah, well, Brenda brought up a good point that I wondered about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| because I did go back and check on some of the folks that I had given money to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| and found out that the project that it was given money for was not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| And so I think that that is a problem, Brenda, in terms of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| And I also agree that, you know, $100 here, $100 there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| in a lot of cases does help some of the neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| but they do become dependent on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| And, frankly, it's a hassle for us, too, as well as for Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| I just wanted to say I think it's usually a good thing for these small community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| and neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| I usually try to go about 200, sometimes less, sometimes more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| But in the overall scheme of things, I think it's good for these neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:13| And I wanted to ask you, Vice Mayor, you said they did this start prior to your time on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3433)|
| 0:57:21| How long have we actually been doing this, or the council been doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| Who knows that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| Before it was a community improvement fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| the council would receive monies as surplus property was sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| and it would be divvied out between the six council districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| And when I came in 1988, that's what they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| They would sell a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| That money would go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| What was it called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| There was a fund number for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| 501?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| 501, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| 501, surplus property fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| And then council would decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| But, I mean, that was even, you know, you'd get sporadic money deposited there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| and the at-large council members didn't even have any funds back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| Now, we could go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| I'll go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| I'm already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Let's sell the convention center and kind of divvy it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| Hold on, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| I'm going to say that it went to 202 sometime in the early to mid-'90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Which is when I probably inherited it from Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| Charles handled the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| and did all this out of his private practice down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| He didn't give it to Rob, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| The runner would run the documents up to the law department, and he handled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| And then once the finance required us to start requisitioning them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| when we became of age and had more info systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| so that's how I got the ordinance and the requisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| And then state law came in, and it got a little more rigid and a little more controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| Yeah, I just want to talk about the flip side portion of the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| That is, I've been on the receiving end of that as a community person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| And in raising money, it's hard sometimes, especially in some of these small neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| and a little incentive to get that done, a matching fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| I mean, they can take that and kind of leverage it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| and go see the local Kroger or someone and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Look, I've got $300 from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| If I can get $300 more, we can get this project done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| Those are the projects that really, really merit your attention, it seems to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| because you're not just giving away money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| You're helping them get a goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:45| and the collateral benefit is you're building that stronger neighborhood group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| So I think that's really healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| I do agree with Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| I think if it becomes a dependency, it's kind of wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| We can't fund people's budgets year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| With regard to the small amounts, what you usually see those come in in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| is if someone's got a project in their district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| and three or four others pile on to help add a little bit of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| but they're trying to hold back some money for something they've got to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| But by and large, I think if we pick projects individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| that kind of merit the help and get something going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| I think we do a lot of good with really a small amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| I mean, I hate that the procedural part is as burdensome as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| and I don't know whether we could look at state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| and see if for grants under a certain number, $300, $500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| whatever the number is, that there'd be less crazy paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| Maybe we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| But we can do a lot of good with a small amount of funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| and you see problems and needs in your district all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| I mean, that's a little lawless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Yeah, well, we're not in a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| So, but, I mean, I think it could become a pet peeve for me and pet projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| and those may not have anything to do with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| I think it's more about what I'm interested in personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| not necessarily, you know, helping the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| But I think it's something we need to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| It is a budget item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| It is $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| And, you know, we need to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| But I would stand in favor of not having them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| But thanks for talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Vice Mayor, it sounds like a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| Oh, dear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| We just had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| You know, I think that one thing is that bothers me a little bit is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:41| giving consistently the same organization every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| If we're going to continue with that, I'd like to see some type of a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| if you get it this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| then there's got to be a time frame to where you don't get it for a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| That way, it really is a community fund rather than, and we all could go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3714)|
| 1:02:01| Yeah, you can look at the same organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| And they're great organizations, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| But you all get the same amount of requests, I'm sure, that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| And you find, well, you know, that's a good cause, but I had already committed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| So I don't know if we continue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Perhaps we look at some type of a amendment to it to where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| you can't get it year to year to year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| So that's just my two cents worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| That sounds like that might be a good idea, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| I had my light on to speak about something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| Are we speaking to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| I was going to speak on the 202 funds, and I appreciate Mr. Walls bringing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| I actually told the mayor, I said, you know, if it's a tight budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| if you want to take out the 202 funds, no problem with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| I just want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| That was sort of between me and her, but, you know, because I'm sort of torn as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| But a couple of things I'm sensitive to is, one, are the district members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| that I don't know if they have a different relationship, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| with the community groups in their district than that large members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| And so I'm sensitive to that and just to the groups that receive the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| You know, I think it would be important to get feedback from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| Of course, I guess they're going to say they need the money, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| So that may not be the – if we're leaning towards doing away with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| that may not be the best way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| But, you know, I think we would hear from a lot of them that it really is important to their projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| and it is important to their events and their events are important to their organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| That's why I've, you know, continued to use the 202 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| And then I just lastly had a question on the community agency grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| What is the process for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Because it is – and I've certainly – the vast majority, I think, is terrific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| but I was just curious, again, on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| I can answer that, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| We put out every year an announcement that we're accepting applications for these community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| and then they all come in to one central place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| The arts and cultural ones do go to – we contract with Lisa Zenni and the Arts Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| to have their own process with independent people making a judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| and then getting a recommendation from them, and that gets a little more arm's length on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| The social service ones do come directly in, and the mayor gets with a small group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| It would be Eddie and I were involved, along with others in the office, to go through those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| and then she makes her recommendations based on their scoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| But some of the same issues that you've discussed with the 202s do come up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| philosophically in consideration of those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Oh, I was just going to go back about the – and I'm not lobbying for it –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| by the dues for the National League of Cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| but I did attend the League of Cities meeting this year in Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| and I found it to be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| And I think, personally, Knoxville needs a seat at that table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| It's just my humble opinion, but I just wanted to make that statement and that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| And I'm not sure about is that are we still a member of the Municipal League?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| Oh, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| We need to – I mean, in my opinion, we certainly need to be part of the Tennessee Municipal League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| That has a lot of impact on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| Well, that was my comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Now, I just never could find – I mean, I asked a lot of different folks who have been here a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| about the benefit of, you know, the $11,000 dues, and it just wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| And, I mean, if councils wish to put it back in, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| But it's just you've got to weigh it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| I mean, what's the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| I have a newspaper I put in the recycle bin when I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| I mean, I just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| Cindy, if you want, we're through the morning session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| We're going to the roundup for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| I hope everybody that can will come with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| It's a world-famous roundup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| So, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| It's at South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| It is at South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| It's open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Are you driving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| Just a little bit before noon, which will be any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| A CAT bus will pick us up on Main Street right outside the city-county building to take us all to the roundup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| and bring us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| So, just waiting for them to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| Are we going to take Gerald with us, or does he have to drive himself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| Gerald's welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Hey, Gerald, I think you ought to tweet out that Dan Brown, little known fact, that Dan Brown is a wrestling fan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:39| That's something I learned this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| And we will reconvene at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130521budgethearingpart2?start=4002)|
