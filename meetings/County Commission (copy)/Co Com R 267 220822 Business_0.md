| 0:01:15| Commissioner Biggs, you have nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=75)|
| 0:01:19| We have nine members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=79)|
| 0:01:21| That is a quorum at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=81)|
| 0:01:24| I will call on Commissioner Lundy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| to lead us in this evening's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| Thank you so much, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| So once I received a letter asking will I do devotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| one word popped up in my head, and it was the word change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| And I'm like, hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| I thought about, oh, I can do devotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| and I thought of Matthew Best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| because he's the new Executive Director at the Change Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| which is a very important space in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| As everyone knows, that we suffer so much violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| and disruption, really, it feels like the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| that's been really intense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| and also with the multi-youth stadium coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| it becomes very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| And so I really want to call Matthew Best up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| He's also the Assistant Pastor at Children of God Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=130)|
| 0:02:16| Yeah, I got that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| So if you want to come up to the podium and give us some word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| and pray for us, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Thank you so much, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| I'm honored to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| It's a privilege to be with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| I just want to share one quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| This morning as I was waking up, I thought about in my previous role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| as the Director of the Future Hope Institute at Johnson University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| I helped high school kids explore the intersection of faith and justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| And one of the things that we did every year was I asked high school students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| I said, if there was one thing you could tell to adults to help better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| understand you, to help better serve you, to help better care for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| lead you, what have you, what would it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| And I was struck the last year I worked at Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| a student told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| I need adults to realize that none of us are worth giving up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| And that stuck with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| It completely shuttered me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| And I live every day remembering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| and being mindful of the fact that our young people, none of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| are too bad or too far gone or too worse off for us to give up on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| And I think the same thing probably applies to every citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| that you all serve throughout our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| And so my prayer for us, my prayer for you all, my prayer for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| is that I would remember that word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| and that I would never think that anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| any of our young people in particular, are too far gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| And so with that, I'd like to pray for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| Lord, we thank you for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| We thank you for this gathering of people that you have allowed to be here to lead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| to serve, to care for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| I pray that we as adults, we as leaders, we as community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| we as examples, as mentors, as whatever you've called us to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| I pray that we will be mindful of the fact that every single one of our young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| every single one of our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| everyone that we come into contact with is deserving of a second, third, fourth, and multiple chances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| And I pray that we would be leaders that would remember that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| that we would not think that it is not worth it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| we would not think that it's too costly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| but that we would do whatever we can to serve in whatever way we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| to make sure that all of our citizens, all of our young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| all of our neighbors are cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| And I pray that you'd help us make decisions that would see that to come true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| In your name we pray. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Thank you so much, sir. Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker, would you lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| Thank you. Would everyone please rise and face our nation's flag and offer the proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=295)|
| 0:05:09| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=309)|

| 0:06:25| to honor Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| let them have the first choice at making the motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=388)|

| 0:07:35| to approve the consent calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=457)|

| 0:07:42| Consent calendars are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| And that takes us, I believe, Madam Clerk, to presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| If I am correct, we don't have any honorary resolutions this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=470)|

| 0:09:37| Through our partnership with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| we added three new educational videos to the YouTube library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| We had just over 17,000 views for the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=582)|

| 0:10:14| it also brings up the numbers of car accidents and, in some cases, severe ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| New drivers are out on the roads going to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| and old ones are still on the roads and forget about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| So we need to all remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| I'm making a plea to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| I've said it before. We need everyone to support their fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| No matter if it's rural metro or if it's another one in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| they need to be a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| Without that, when we respond to someone's fire or fire alarms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| and people forget about fire alarms and they only think about fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| and they're not a subscriber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| they usually, more than likely, will get a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| Sometimes that bill can be rather large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| We don't like it when they get a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| I hate fielding phone calls from people who have now got a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| after they've suffered maybe the worst loss they've ever had in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| And now, all of a sudden, when that happens, they want to now be a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| Is that fair? That's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| It's kind of like trying to buy car insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| when you're providing information to the Tennessee Highway Patrol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| standing in the middle of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| We don't like sending those bills out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| and I can tell you they are not fun phone calls to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| Please, as you talk to your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| please encourage them to become a member of the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| whichever one services them out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| They can't pay for it all at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| You can pay monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| You have people that are on fixed income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| We have plans for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| We will work with just about anybody before the fire comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| before that emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| After that happens, it becomes very difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| like trying to buy car insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| when you're standing in the middle of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| I've got a picture I'll have to show you next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| I didn't get it to Mr. Russell in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| but if you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to entertain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| Questions for Mr. Bagwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=739)|

| 0:12:35| Mr. Chairman, commissioners, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| Thank you for giving me another chance to come see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| this is the last time that you are going to be punished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| by having to listen to me speak, so congratulations on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| Appreciate all you all have done for this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| as well as for the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| It has been greatly appreciated, your time with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| In your packet, you have our monthly echo report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| and you can see the numbers are still good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| The economy is still strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| You will notice that the unemployment rate has risen slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| over the past month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| That's normal when kids leave school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| They're counted into the labor force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| and so that number automatically increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| It will drop down in September when we see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| so it's pretty normal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| The only other thing I wanted to bring up to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| was we are preparing to launch what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| the ENOX 2.0 Opportunity Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| I'm not sure what makes it 2.0 versus just 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| but that's the name of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| If you all remember, during COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| we created the ENOX Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| and the role of that was to try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| as many of our students and families within KCS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| access to reliable internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| and that was very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| So this is trying to build off of that initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| This is based on a program that was done in Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| called Tech Goes Home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| where they gave every one of the citizens have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| to get a very affordable laptop for them to bring home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| as well as have internet access to which to use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| and the training of which to use it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Internet literacy is a major problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| within parts of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| So what this initiative does is it addresses digital literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| with access to employment, education, health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| and other services, and we were only able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| We received two grants, one from KUB Fiber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| and the other from Heartland Forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| which is a new organization based in Arkansas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| that is really trying to get the heartland of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| to increase its economic prowess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| We're starting with three site partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| so one is Pond Gap Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| the other is Cecil Moss Recreation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| and then the third is Knox Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| which is a program with the Knoxville Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| We will take up to 50 adults in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| teach them how to create a resume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=907)|

| 0:15:18| and other things that are going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| as well as access Knox County Schools' online platforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| for education possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| They will have the option to purchase a new Chromebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| for $50, which is unheard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| They will also have access to tutorials on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| that will help them as they go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| as well as assistance in applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=937)|

| 0:15:43| afford Internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| The goal is that we will do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| the chamber will kind of lead this initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| through its first iteration, through those three partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| and then we will work to train the trainer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| so that hopefully another partner will come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| and run the program full-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| which is just beyond our scope of being able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| That's it. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| Any questions for Mr. Odom, Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| I see none. Thank you, sir, as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| This brings us to our first segment of public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| and, Commissioners, here is how I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| to handle public forum, if there's no objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| just in the interest of transparency and fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| We have 10 individuals who have requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| to speak at public forum, all on item 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| I see some of those individuals are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| so if your preference is to speak at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| then as I call your name, please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Those who are not here, or if your preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| is to wait and speak at the zoning meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| you'll be given an opportunity to do so then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| So our first speaker is Scott Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1012)|
| 0:17:02| Welcome, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| You'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| I'm Scott Davis, Field Box 11315, Knoxville 37939,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| and I appreciate you all giving me the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| to speak to you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| First, I'd like to retroactively see if we can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| all the consent items off the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| I'd like to hear you all go through every one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| and discuss, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| No support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Also, Commissioner Biggs, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| and Commissioner Bussler, thank you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| for your service and your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| I apologize for not being able to make it to the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| so I'll make this very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Whenever you look at Board of Zoning and Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| or any appeals processes as it relates to items coming before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| on the development side from zoning, concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| use item review, all those items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| if I contracted to buy a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| January 10th of this year, it would probably be October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| maybe November, that I could get everything approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| through the governmental approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| That's if we didn't have any delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| But also, we'd like to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| from the greedy developer side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| You all know what we're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| You expect what we're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| But every now and then, we ought to put ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| in the shoes of the actual property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| If you're a property owner that has to sell their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| to pay off medical bills or try to send their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| or grandchild to college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| and you have to wait 12, 16, 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| to be able to sell your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| it puts a burden on a lot of families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| If they're trying to sell their land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| to potentially retire early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| that delay process is constantly there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| so that 10 to 12 to 14 to 16 month process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| for these people to be able to put money in their pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| And also for us on our side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| going back to them constantly saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| well, we've got two more months of governmental approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| Well, this one got appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| We have three more months of governmental approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| After a while, it wears on people trying to sell their land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| and be able to do something for their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| So we always look at it from the greedy developer's side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| step back for a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| and look at it from the actual landowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| and property owners' side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| and look at it from their perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| Every day that goes by, every month of delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| everything that constantly pushes their money out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| affects their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Thank you all for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| I appreciate you giving me a chance to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Have a good evening. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Kevin Murphy is next on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Kevin, did you want to speak at zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| You don't? Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| David Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| Is Mr. Lee here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| We will call for him at zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1181)|

| 0:20:04| I do see Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1210)|

| 0:20:15| 17 Market Square, Suite 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| And I'm here on behalf of the Chamber to support the effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| to clarify what items are appropriate for appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| The Chamber supports clear and predictable planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| and zoning policies, as well as timely regulatory processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| that promote economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| And that is what this ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| The Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| is aided by a professional staff when reviewing application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| This process is open and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| As commissioners accept written comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| hear from the public at their planning workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| and again at the voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| It's duplicative and redundant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| to go through that entire process again on appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| An elected judge ruling on the legality of the commission's actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| is the most appropriate check and balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| and that's what this ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Arguably, this community's greatest economic challenge is housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| Lack of housing at all price points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| hinders employers' ability to attract talent at all levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Whether it's executives at Smith & Wesson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| teachers and police officers, or young professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| our ability to recruit talent to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| is hampered because of our lack of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| Our ability to keep talent here or bring them back home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| and I'm talking about our children and our grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| is difficult because of the lack of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| Our seniors are in homes they can no longer maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| because of the lack of housing choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| And finally, many residents are deprived of the opportunity to own a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| which is the single largest asset for many Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Instead, they are left to the mercy of fast-rising rents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| which prevents them from accumulating any savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| An opponent of this measure has argued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| that the BZA hears very few of these appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| and I would cite that as a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| precisely a reason to be in favor of this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| The right to appeal is rarely used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| but this ordinance would preserve that right to appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| and make the development process clearer and more predictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| One of your colleagues asked me last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| if this change would solve our housing shortage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| and it won't. It will take this and a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| But new housing starts have yet to reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| where they were before the 2008 recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| so we're not going to even begin to solve this crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| if we continue business as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| I urge you to adopt this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| which preserves the right to appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| and creates a process that's clear, predictable, and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you, Ms. Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Is Julie Fritz here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| I didn't see Julie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| I did see Hanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Hanson Sale, you are the last person on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| The last is the best, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Hanson Sale from the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| 609 White Scarborough Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| I am here on behalf of the Knoxville Association of Realtors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| to indicate our association's support of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| First and foremost, I'd like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| that taking no action at all today is not a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| Given the law director's opinion and memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| the county has admitted that what we are doing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| whereby BZA hears appeals of development plans, is not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| As a legal question, it's really hard to argue otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| Taking no action today is simply not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| The law is the law, and we should follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| This is also a matter of what's right and proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| An unelected appointed body should not hear the appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| of another unelected appointed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| As it currently stands, citizens can provide input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| and public comment about development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| at planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| If those citizens do not agree with the informed judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| of the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| they want to be able to continue to present the same input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| and the same comment to yet another unelected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| in order to get a different answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| After the planning commission, the issue at hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| is fundamentally a legal matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| and legal questions should be decided by a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| It's also important to note among the major metro counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| neither Metro Nashville, Hamilton, or Shelby County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| allow appeals of development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| to be heard by an unelected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| On a personal note, as a young person born and raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| in Knox County, I'm perplexed and somewhat saddened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| that this issue has become as big as it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| Home prices are more than 40% higher than in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| and the typical home is almost $70,000 more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| than it was just two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| The monthly payment for a medium-priced home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| has doubled in the past 18 months alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Households making less than $75,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| can afford just a third of active listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| Ninety-nine percent of rental units are occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| and rents have skyrocketed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Knox County is 17,000 housing units short of meeting demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| and building permits haven't even yet reached pre-2008 levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| These trends are why Knoxville has 20,000 fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| low-income homeowners than we did just a decade ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| We are at a critical juncture in Knox County's history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| facing a once-in-a-generation housing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| with housing affordability at its lowest level since the 1980s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| when mortgage rates were 18%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| Yet here we are, arguing about who should review what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| Back in March, I told this very body that the housing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| is in large part a problem of political will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| and our ability to make tough decisions when they matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| and here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| This is about more than simply the issue before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| It is about what kind of county do we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| We brand ourselves as an affordable place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| but that's not just inherently true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| It is a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| Zoning, in its original conception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| was intended to protect the health and safety of residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| but over a period of many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| it has been at times co-opted to serve other purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| and in many cases to limit housing production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| in the very places that people want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| Our land-use process does need to be reformed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| It has for decades failed to produce the amount of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| that we need, in part because it's deviated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| from its original intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| I'm a strong believer in making decisions at a local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| and people passionately working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| to make their community a better place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| but we're going over a cliff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| and whatever benefits to local decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| at this far down of a level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| and there really are benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| it has failed to produce the housing that we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| and we shouldn't forget that it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1641)|

| 0:27:35| As Amy Nolan rightly said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| this is by no means the answer to the housing crisis before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| but it is a small step in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1661)|

| 0:29:05| Of course, our usual suspects are in the room tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| but we do have a special guest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| former Commission Chair and our good friend Hugh Nystrom is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1751)|

| 0:29:20| Where is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| He was literally right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| I just saw him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| I guess he escaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| But we're glad to have Hugh Nystrom with us a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| So, Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Item 49, consideration of the correction of the clerical errors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| regarding the acceptance of one county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| At the May 23, 2022 County Commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| due to a clerical error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1787)|

| 0:29:53| was accepted under the incorrect name of Budding Vine Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| The correct name of that road accepted by the County Commission on August 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| 2022 is hereby noted and approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1811)|

| 0:30:18| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| That item passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Item number 51 is consideration of the closure of a portion of Old Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| near the First Comforter Church to improve safety for motorists and adjacent residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Well, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| Make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Motion to approve by Commissioner Bussler, seconded by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| I would like to discuss some things about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Mr. Snowden, did we get the report from TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| Could you share with the Commission what we found?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| I sent that email to you guys probably around 3.30 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| My apologies for the timeliness of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| TDOT did not get me their traffic analysis on Ridgeview and Tazewell Pike until early this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| That analysis indicated that in the peak hour, I think there was actually less than 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1873)|
| 0:31:22| I think it was in the mid-50s vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| What I did was take the vehicles that we had anticipated that would be re-diverted to that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1884)|
| 0:31:32| and added to that and ran the signal warrant analysis again and conferred with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| TDOT confirmed my suspicions that even if the entirety of the traffic that is now currently going to Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1897)|
| 0:31:45| were to use the Ridgeview Road intersection, it still wouldn't warrant a traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| To put it in perspective, 64 trips, that's a little over one vehicle per minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| so the queuing we don't anticipate to be that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| One of the things that I also suggested was because obviously some of the folks that spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| had some concerns about that left turn, and I agreed during peak hours that it probably could be problematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| even in absence of a signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| One of the things that we talked about was looked at the, and I drove it myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| the alternate route of Luttrell Road, which does allow for the right turn on Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| eliminates the left turn on Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| We are crossing two lanes of traffic that oftentimes does queue up to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| even with the developer's improvements, and that distance was less than a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| and probably added about two minutes to their travel time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| so I'm conscious of their concerns and their inconvenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| but considering all the factors, looking at the data, the crash statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| we believe that the closure of Old Tazewell Pike as first presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| would be the best thing from an engineering perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| I'm looking at you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Is this, Jim, if you don't mind, we're 35 days from the next commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| Is that a time frame that we could stand if there were an opportunity to meet with the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1990)|
| 0:33:19| Did you discuss the possibility with TDOT of closing off that five-way intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| We talked about it a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| and that was one of the things that one of the community's folks brought into the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| Obviously, I think there's probably 50 to 60 parcels that would be impacted by that closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2012)|
| 0:33:40| I'm sure some of those would not be in support of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| whereas everybody along Old Tazewell Pike is in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| The closure, due to the very short throat depth of the intersection, it would be difficult to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| I mean, you could install guardrail or build a berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| but you'd almost have to shift the intersections because the throat depth is so small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| So once again, just a very unique situation out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| It sounds to me like the closure is going to be the only way forward to me in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2049)|
| 0:34:17| Folks on Ridgeview Road don't like it, but I've said before, I grew up on Ridgeview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2057)|
| 0:34:26| We used to use it all the time, and my family doesn't use it because it's just too narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| And I just don't know what we accomplish at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| If TDOT says there's no reason to signalize Ridgeview Road and it's not practical to close off the other intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| I know that there's a good way forward besides going ahead with the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| I think that's where we're going to end up anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| So I guess that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| Kevin, are you – I would like to hear from you. I know this is a little bit unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| Thank you, Chairman Buehler. Kevin Murphy, 4508.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2103)|

| 0:35:11| This is coming out at 3.30, and we haven't seen any of the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| If you want to proceed with closure, but we were expecting a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| I know there are a number of residents there, so if – it is on your agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| but just – yeah, nobody from the community has seen anything that's been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| That's fair to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Yeah, I mean, I went into – I mean, I left last week's work session assuming that if we got any data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| it would be really late, and if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| I'd like to at least let folks know that we looked at all this and here's why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| because I have heard from a pretty good number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| So I'd like to offer a substitute motion that we postpone this until September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| I have a motion by Commissioner Buehler, substitute motion by Commissioner Buehler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| second by Commissioner Lundy to postpone until September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| Any discussion? Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Mr. Snowden, is there anything that's like – that's eminent right now that being a month delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| is going to trigger delays in TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| I mean, is there anything that would – any reason why that wouldn't be a prudent way to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| I mean, is there something that's like happening in the next week or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| Not to my knowledge, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| I mean, certainly I would have loved to have had this count much sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| but TDOT and us, we wanted to make sure that that count was a valid count and had school traffic in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| and obviously we had to wait until school was in session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| and really TDOT actually wanted to wait another week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| so we talked about moving it up just so that we could meet this time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| So it was just – but I don't foresee really anything that would change the analysis in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2214)|
| 0:37:02| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2222)|

| 0:39:56| I would like to say something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| What we have, especially out in the counties, we have some people that are building houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| out and away from mainly everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| And we had this one person come up to me and they had a large fifth wheel that they put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| water, sewer, and electric to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| And because the zoning ordinance will not let an RV be a permanent resident, they couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| But they wanted to be there to watch and protect the product that they were having shipped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| out there to build that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| Well, if you put it to work, in an RV you can live in for a short period of time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| it can be very comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| But because sheriff's offices are reactive instead of proactive, the resident could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2444)|
| 0:40:52| on property to protect building materials that are shipped out there, making sure people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| are not getting out there on their property and going into an unfinished house and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| hurt and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| But it also gives the resident a chance to make sure that everything is being done properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| with the house that they're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| And it should be, when we send it to them for an ordinance, we should limit it to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| time set to where they give them this amount of time to build their house that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| live in that RV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| And a lot of RVs have a lot of safety features to it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| And that was one of the complaints that they had said that, you know, an RV is not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| a safe type vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| But most RVs have at least two fire extinguishers in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| They also have the windows that you can unlatch and it just pops up and out so you can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| out of most all the windows in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| So it really didn't make a lot of sense not to let that individual stay on their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| and watch their house being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| And that's why I wanted to bring this before you all if you had any questions about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| we were trying to do there or what I was trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| But if you were building a house way out in the country, wouldn't you want to be out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| there to protect your investment and be something that you can put a construction trailer on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| it, you can put a house trailer on it, but anything that says recreational vehicle, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| can't put on there as a housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| And that limits them to a fairly nice place to live until they get through with the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| and they take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Commissioner Jay and Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Mr. Snowden, can you, we didn't get into this last week, but can you just help, you oversee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2557)|
| 0:42:49| the codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| We actually, in between last week and this week, I had a constituent issue with a trailer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| on a home in a different part of the county that didn't have anything to do with building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| a house, but it was more or less about living there and living on a trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| Can you help just understand what are the rules and regs on a trailer and speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| because we usually make laws for the exception, not the people that don't follow the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2590)|
| 0:43:17| not the people that follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| And so when it reads where it's presented as Commissioner Bussler has stated, it makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| a lot of sense, but then it might open a Pandora's box of people living in their trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| They could not finish their home and just stay in the trailer forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| I mean, what does this open up for you when I think of codes and what other circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| when it comes to living in a temporary RV is currently on the books that you guys are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| working through when it comes to codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| In a manufactured home, it has a specific designation from the state, so they're classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| different than a travel trailer, and we permit those different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| We only do a zoning review just for setbacks on a mobile home because they're permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| through the state because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| I do think this, we talked about it internally on my staff, this proposal that Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| Bussler brings forward is something we see all the time, and it necessarily, under certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| zones, it's not harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| But I do think to safeguard some of those things, we do need, and I think Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| Bussler put in there maybe some sort of connotation about that they have to have an active building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| They have to be caught up with inspections because what we worry about is if they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| get it and they move in, there needs to be some kind of trigger for us to allow for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| So if this were to go forward, I would like to suggest language in there that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| to have an active building permit and that they have to be up to date on inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| Otherwise, these folks could use something temporary to turn into permanent, and we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| need a trigger to be able to enforce that removal of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| But I think in general it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I think there's some people that could use this that otherwise wouldn't be harmful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| Is there a current, within codes, is there a limit now if somebody had a piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| could they just put an RV on it and live out there currently today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| It would be illegal as soon as they moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| So there isn't any time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| So what's the delineation between camping and living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| Do what, I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| So what's the determination between camping and living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| If I had five acres in Commissioner Beeler's district and I wanted to put a travel trailer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| on there and I was camping, how long could I camp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| As far as the zoning ordinance, that's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| Okay, so I wouldn't be allowed to camp on that property in an RV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Okay, so this is the only way, and do you find this often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| Do you enforce this in codes often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| It comes up from time to time, and it has went to BCA in the past, and BCA has allowed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2753)|
| 0:46:02| under certain conditions, but they have put a time frame on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| Someone's caring for an ailing family member and they're living on the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| As soon as that situation concludes, then we have to ask them to remove that camper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2774)|
| 0:46:22| It has been approved, but very, very seldom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| Okay, so your team would be in favor of this if it had a timeline or a timeline trigger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2785)|
| 0:46:36| somebody had an active building permit and were up to inspections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| I think we would maybe want to contemplate the zone, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| I don't know if we would want somebody to move a travel trailer in on a PR zone and building a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| I think that could be a little bit unusual and inappropriate, but to your point, if it's a five-acre track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| I don't see any problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| But this wouldn't limit it to, I mean, some of our agricultural land, currently zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| could be right next to another neighborhood all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| Yeah, it would just, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Okay, it helps to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| I, too, am generally open to the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| I'm not sure the language is exactly right yet to make sure that we don't open up more work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| for our engineering and codes team, so I don't know if it's something that could be amended tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| in a way that the language kind of closes those loopholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| or if this is something that somebody else needs to, if we need to delay this for a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| and carry the torch for Commissioner Busler into next month to make sure we get all the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| I'm hesitant to pass something unless it's right, especially if it opens up too many other loopholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| because otherwise we're just going to have to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| I don't think we can pass anything tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| Actually, we're just sending it to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| to recommend the specifics of the zoning ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| So sending it to them with those notes saying please address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| Well, that's fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| We have Commissioner Schoonmaker next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| I'm sorry, Commissioner, was that, Commissioner Jay, were you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| Okay, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| I could support this kind of initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| but, again, what I was thinking in my mind is when you said out in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| so the first thing that popped up was this should be restricted to something like five acres or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| because we do have some residential areas that are ag zones still where someone might have an acre of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2921)|
| 0:48:51| He could just, he or she could dump a load of gravel, move their RV in, get a building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| and sit there and not do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| So I think if we're going to send it to Knox Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| we should say what the time limit is and if there is an acreage requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2943)|
| 0:49:14| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| You did mention right up front that we had to put a time for the building of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2956)|
| 0:49:22| You just can't sit there for, like, two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| It's got to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| The other thing about manufactured housing just came to my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| Can you do a plumbing inspection on a manufactured house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| The siren was in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| Can you do a plumbing inspection on a manufactured house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| Do we do plumbing inspections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| Can you do a plumbing inspection on a manufactured house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| We can, but typically the state does all the hookups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| The state has it, from my understanding, that on a manufactured house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| you can't crawl underneath that house and inspect that plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| The state does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| The state is supposed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| How many inspectors do we have at the state level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| You have six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Not too many for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| You have six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| You talk about that they can move a manufactured house on a piece of property out in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| and they don't have to do a plumbing inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| That means they can run a pipe up to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| but they don't have to hook up their sewage to that pipe because they don't have the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| because the state has limited their right to do a plumbing inspection underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| They can't even crawl under the house to do a plumbing inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| So what I'm asking is for somebody that has the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| like an RV to have that short time period to build a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| but they can pull a trailer on there, manufactured housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| and it doesn't even have to be hooked up to sewage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| and they can live in it because they can't crawl under it and inspect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| So what I'm saying is I'm trying to do this for individuals that are trying to do right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| I'm not trying to push something by that nothing's, you know, you can't control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| That's why I want to put a time limit on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| let them say which zonings would be proper for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| and make sure that that individual understands that they have this time limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| or frame that they have to build that housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| and that's what I would like that recommendation coming back from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you, Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| I believe all that Commissioner Buster is asking for is for us to send this to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| for their recommendations on things that they would find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| or want to codify into an ordinance along with codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| You know, I think on an agricultural piece of property in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| an RV that has hookups that are inspected and legitimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| does give someone the opportunity to guard their stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| I think it would be fairly easy to put these parameters on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| such as it must be moved when a certificate of occupancy is issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| there must be an active permit with a time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| There are plenty of safeguards that could be put around this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| and to limit it to agricultural perhaps, as Commissioner Schoonmaker said, on size of tracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3133)|
| 0:52:21| I think it's a fairly good idea that should go back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| should be sent to MPC for their input along with codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| on a way that this could be crafted to help citizens that are trying to build houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| on large tracts of agricultural property and provide them with a safety net while doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3156)|
| 0:52:46| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Is there any other discussion, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| We have a proper motion by Commissioner Busler with a second by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| to approve this resolution to request the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| to recommend amendments to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| Thank you, that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| Madam Clerk, I believe we're to other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| Discussion item regarding attendance of all boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Commissioner Busler, this is your item, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Why I brought this up is we have a lot of boards and a lot of committees that we sit on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| and sometimes some of the things that when you're on that board or committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| nobody else sees or they don't have a report on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| And I would like, you know, some of the things that we did on a state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| or some of the ones that we do locally here, some of our committees and some of our boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| we can come back and report some of the things that we may want to get into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| to see what the future would hold for us as a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| and what we might want to be more proactive in what these boards and committees do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| I sat on a railroad committee for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| and it never did really meet until the federal government let some money go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| in how they were updating the local, what they call, short-line railroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| And it was very interesting what they do and what they mean to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| And we don't really make, I mean, we do reports and things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| but sometimes we get tied up in a lot of other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| and when we lose track of some of the things we already have, then we can make it even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| And I know when we get our chamber here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| and he talks about how we can keep what we got and how we can make what we've got better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| we kind of gloss over that in our committees, the things that we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| And I just wanted to bring that up as a discussion item to see how you all feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| NACO, you all got to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| We had two went to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| Very interesting, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| There was a lot of things that you saw out there that the rest of us don't have any idea what really goes on there to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| You really look, touch, and feel it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| And I think that's some of the things I would like for this commission as it moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| to bring that touch, look, and feel type thing that you can explain to the rest of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| how good those things are and what they mean to the county and what they mean for our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| So I just wanted to bring that up as a discussion item to know how you all felt about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| And we're not trying to give you more work to do or anything like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| but sometimes you come back and you're really excited and you want to talk to some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| that you've been in some of these committee meetings, and we don't get a chance to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| So anyway, that's what it was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| Thank you, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| Any other discussion, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| I will say, Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Bessler, it has been an honor to serve with you on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3360)|
| 0:56:08| I know we have a tiny bit of business left to do tonight, but this was the time I felt the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3373)|
| 0:56:24| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Well, kind of following that thought, even though you've got a few more hours left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| I just wanted to compliment you, Chairman Wheeler, on running this past year very smoothly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3390)|
| 0:56:39| very calmly, very professionally, and allowing the public the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| And I just thought you ran an excellent meeting for us this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| And I know you sent us a letter a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| but I would really hope that you would consider running again as Chairman of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3416)|
| 0:57:04| You're very kind, and I appreciate your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| I will take all the compliments I can get right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| At this point, Chair will entertain a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| Oh, no, I didn't hear anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| Motion to adjourn by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Second by Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-business?start=3446)|
