| 0:01:20| And I just wanted to let everybody know that prior to our meeting today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=80)|
| 0:01:24| our workshop today, Councilmembers McKenzie, Thomas, and Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| all let me know that they had previous engagements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| and weren't going to be able to attend this evening and join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| Well, today City Council will be hearing presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| about animal welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| The Animal Control Board is considering updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=100)|
| 0:01:42| to further enhance protections in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| and so getting started, joining us in our discussion today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| Council will be welcoming representatives from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| the Humane Society of the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| and Knoxville's Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| So let's go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| I'd like to welcome representatives from Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| So when you come up to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| please remember to give us your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| Kyle Lang, 1509 Chicago Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=139)|
| 0:02:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| So thank you, esteemed Councilmembers and members of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| for inviting us here tonight to discuss this very important piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| The Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance, or KAWA for short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| is a group of concerned citizens advocating for improved animal laws in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| specifically advocating for a ban on unsupervised tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| and other improvements in animal-related minimum care standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| Again, my name is Kyle Ann Lang,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| and I am a founding member of KAWA along with Julia Roy and Jana Cecil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| Our other leadership team members are Tanya Arnett and Julia Tucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| Over the past nine months, we have worked extensively to develop revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| to the City of Knoxville Code of Ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| that directly impact the welfare of our citizens and our animal companions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| and have taken care to ensure Council and other interested parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| were informed of the process every step of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| We are here tonight to present and discuss these proposed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| and the driving forces behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| From the onset, we have taken the approach that is critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| when reviewing potential legislation to remove emotion from the equation as much as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| and to focus on facts, data, and statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| to ensure the end product is well thought out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| addresses and mitigates any potential unexpected negative outcomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| and serves our citizens to the highest degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| We consulted with numerous local, regional, and national organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| as well as read countless articles and literally hundreds of animal care regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| from jurisdictions all over America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| The resulting language is an extremely collaborative effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| reflecting this extensive research and consultation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| KAWA interviewed 16 different animal control departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| from jurisdictions in which various forms of tethering laws have been enacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| to figure out what worked, what didn't, what they would have done differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| and then used their lessons learned to develop a blueprint for success for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| The language we developed was subsequently reviewed, discussed, and modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| over the course of several meetings with the City of Knoxville Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| and ultimately unanimously approved last August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| The language also then passed an internal review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| by the City Legal Department and the City Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| We are aware that since that time, several bills have been introduced, but not yet passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| at the state level to regulate certain shelter and tethering standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| and to make violations of these standards a criminal matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| While we welcome these positive changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| they should not prohibit us from enacting more comprehensive regulations at the city level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| In fact, as you will see, there are many jurisdictions in Tennessee and throughout America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| that have animal care regulations more stringent than what are set forth at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| I would hope that Knoxville, a progressive city that claims to be dog-friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| would also hold ourselves to a higher standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| So what prompted the creation of KAWA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| The existing Code of Ordinances allows for the permanent tethering of animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| and has limited language related to minimum care standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| such as shelter, room to exercise, and nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| In fact, the way the current Code reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| there are vastly more restrictive requirements to shelter and protect chickens than dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| In addition, the lack of details contained within the minimum care standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| often made it difficult for animal control to enforce regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| The proposed changes would prohibit unsupervised tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| enhance some of the minimum care standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| and add more comprehensive definitions related to animal welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| The tethering language also includes a six-month transition period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| and an additional two 30-day warning periods to come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| As a note of clarification, generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| the terms chaining and tethering refer to the practice of faxing a dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| to a stationary object or pulley-slash-trolley system and leaving them unattended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| These terms are not meant to refer to an animal being walked on a leash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| or cases of supervised temporary tethering while an owner is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| Note that I may use the terms interchangeably throughout this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| So what do the leading experts say about tethering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| This slide is just a very small representation of stances on tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| by welfare organizations, animal behavior experts, veterinary groups, and federal departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| The Humane Society of the United States website, validated today as being current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| recommends that all dogs live indoors, but says that any dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| if they must live outdoors part or all of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| should be provided with a safe, escape-proof enclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| I would have you note the absence of the word tether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| where they may express natural behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| I think we can all agree that a chained dog is unable to express their natural behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| Since 1997, facilities regulated under the Animal Welfare Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| were no longer allowed to use tethering as a primary means of enclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| As a result of their position of regulatory oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| the USDA concluded that tethering is not a humane practice nor in an animal's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| The American Veterinary Medical Association policy states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| to never tether your dog as it could contribute to aggressive behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| Dr. Fox, a leading expert in the science of animal behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=494)|

| 0:08:30| which has led to a cultural shift and ensuing mass movements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| to limit the tethering of dogs in our communities across America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| As such, the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| are there existing laws that regulate chaining in other communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| And the answer is a resounding yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| with 24 states, Washington, D.C., and several hundred localities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| taking action with more and more joining the movement on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| In fact, there are 65 cities and 59 counties in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| and our neighboring states alone that regulate chaining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| a few examples of which you can see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| to include Oak Ridge, Bristol, Chattanooga, and most recently, Johnson City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| Many of these communities have implemented full bans on unsupervised tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| similar to the language we are here to discuss today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| This next slide demonstrates those jurisdictions with a full ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| with the size of the city name being proportionate to its population size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| We did some analysis on the details of these regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| and have some interesting takeaways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| These bans started in 1992, three decades ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| I would say, Knoxville, we are behind the curve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| In addition, there are 25.7 million people that live in these communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| with population sizes ranging from a few thousand to over two million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| I would argue that if 25.7 million people can successfully live under a complete ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| in diverse communities ranging from rural areas with limited resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| to very large metropolitan areas with complex socioeconomic variables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| then so can we, a progressive community of less than 200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| As I mentioned previously, when we started this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| we wanted to make sure it was based upon as much data and evidence as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| To that end, we interviewed animal control departments in 16 different communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| that had implemented various types of regulations regarding tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| so that we could create a playbook of best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| as our intent was never to recreate the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| What we found is that, without exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| communities with time-limited and overnight tethering bans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| were dissatisfied with their ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| due to the fact that they are simply not enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| On the flip side, communities with full unsupervised tethering bans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| were pleased with their ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| and reported 10 to 15 percent less welfare calls to animal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| and less dogs at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| In general, locales with transition periods similar to the one we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| and resources in place to assist low-income families come into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| have experienced minimal surrenders to shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| Let's talk for a minute about the problems tethering a dog can have in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| It is important to note that this is about much more than just animal welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| Chained dogs are a public safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| They are often unsocialized, territorial, and aggressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| and there is a multitude of empirical and observational evidence to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| A chained dog unable to flee often feels forced to fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| and tragically the victims of chained dog attacks are usually children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| The CDC reports that a chained dog is 2.8 times more likely to bite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| and that the dogs most likely to attack are male, unneutered, and chained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| A separate CDC study determines that 30 percent of children killed by dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| in the United States died after wandering too close to a chained dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| Furthermore, tethered dogs are also prone to getting loose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| and may act aggressively and are likely to chase and attack unsuspecting passerby and pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| Tethered dogs are also more likely to bark due to boredom, distress, anxiety, and or fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| causing a public nuisance to neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| The City of Knoxville Animal Control Department conducts approximately 800 welfare checks per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| the majority stemming from calls from citizens concerned about chained animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| These checks are taking away valuable time that could be devoted to other animal welfare activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| under the department's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Animal control officers often visit the same address multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| and because of the way our code is written, oftentimes there is little officers can do to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| By the time it becomes a clear case of animal cruelty, it is often too late to save the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| In addition, female chained dogs are susceptible to getting pregnant by dogs at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| resulting in unwanted litters and additional burden on our shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| And of course, chaining has been proven time and time again to be unsafe for dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| from behavioral, psychological, and physical perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| They are prone to entanglement and strangulation, disease, embedded collars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| physical deterioration due to lack of exercise, overturned food and water bowls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| and harassment and attack from other animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| In fact, within the past month in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| two chained dogs were attacked and killed by a dog at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| a tragedy preventable if the dogs have been contained within secure enclosures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=819)|
| 0:13:49| In order to determine this, we analyzed every single animal control welfare check complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| in the last three months, removing those not clearly related to dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| and duplicate calls to the same addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Although not all the remaining calls were likely to do with chained dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| for the purposes of this exercise, we assumed they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| We then extrapolated that number out to come up with an annualized amount of 660 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| According to an American Veterinary Medical Association 2018 study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| 47% of Tennessean households own a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| There are around 83,400 households in the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| Based upon this, we can conclude that a tethering ban would only impact .8% of the households in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| And again, that is a high estimate in order to demonstrate worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| We made the assumption that half of these were permanently chained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| while the other half were temporarily tethered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| As you can see, the proposed changes would have a minimum impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| while providing a maximum return to the animals and citizens in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| Based on our data review from animal control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| we were able to determine that 45% of welfare check complaints involving dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| were not located in low-income census tracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| leaving us to conclude that many households have the means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| to provide an alternative mechanism of restraint for their dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| However, for those families that do not have the means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| there is a new nonprofit called Chain-Free Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| that was created specifically to assist eligible families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| build low-cost or free fences and or repair existing fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| Chain-Free Knoxville is based upon a model that has been successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| in many, many other communities across America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| You may ask, what about people who rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| The fences Chain-Free Knoxville installs are six-foot panels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| designed to be secure and escape-proof but are not permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| As a result, we have not experienced any issues with landlords agreeing to installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| In fact, one of the Chain-Free organizations we spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| located in Durham, North Carolina, has built over 2,500 fences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| and has never had a landlord refuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| In addition, Chain-Free Knoxville understands every situation is unique and different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| and will work with every family on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| to determine the solution that best fits their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| Of course, citizens also have the option of building their own enclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| Assuming the house is used as one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| the approximate cost to build a 150-square-foot enclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| with six-foot panels and a gate is around $350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| Ultimately, you do not have to have a fence to have a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Apartment dwellers don't have private yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Their dogs live inside the home with the family and go on walks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| There are many resources available to help people train their dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| to be well-behaved members of the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Chain-Free Knoxville, working in collaboration with Animal Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| can provide information on these resources to owners as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| A question has come up about people that tether their dogs for short periods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| which is often used as a means to allow the dog a potty break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| No-cost options for compliance include staying outside with the dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1022)|

| 0:17:10| Again, many millions of dogs live happily in apartments around the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| without access to yards, whether fenced or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Citizens, of course, also have the option of purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| or building a 150-square-foot enclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| Some have asked about the possibility of pulley or trolley systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| The fact is that many of the same risks associated with fixed-point chaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| are still applicable with a pulley system to include entanglement and hanging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| lack of socialization, and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| A pulley would not have prevented the sad case I mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| of the two dogs recently killed while on a chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Just as with a tether, there is also the likelihood of breaking and escaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| off the pulley, potentially causing a nuisance to pass her by and pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| Pulleys can be difficult to install, especially when there are multiple dogs involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| Animal Control in Shelbyville, Tennessee, told us that they had implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| a pulley-only ordinance but later rescinded it after they realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| it was not any safer for the animals and due to the difficulties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| they experienced in trying to implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| As noted here, this is not just about providing a few more feet of room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| for the animal, but is a matter of safety for both the dog and the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| The end result of all of this is an improved piece of legislation that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| among other things, allows for easier interpretations of requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| by our citizens, greater enforceability by our Animal Control Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| increases public safety, and improves animal welfare standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| We took care throughout this process to ensure that we addressed and mitigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| all potential unexpected negative outcomes, and to ensure resources were in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| in order to assist impacted households to come into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| There is overwhelming support in the community for these changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| demonstrated by over 1,300 petition signatures in just over one week's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| and cumulatively between the members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| hundreds of emails of support from your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1151)|

| 0:19:24| rescues such as Fighting for the Bullies, and Pitman Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| owner of hundreds of rental properties throughout our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| In conclusion, I am hopeful that Knoxville can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| to end this inhumane and outdated practice so that we can live up to our tagline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| of a dog-friendly city and make that a reality for all of our canine citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Thank you. I'll open it up for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| Any council members? Council members saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1196)|
| 0:20:04| I was going to open it up so we could ask questions of each individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| and then we can move on, but I don't see any questions at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| so we'll move on, but thank you for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| All right, I'd like to welcome representatives from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| the Humane Society of the United States here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| I believe the state director is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| Could you please give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| and let us know the organization you're with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Yeah, Jessica Heider, and it's 2772 Short Springs Road, Tullahoma, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Thanks. Yeah, so I am the Tennessee State Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| for the Humane Society of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| Thank you all very much for taking an interest in animal welfare issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| I really do commend your efforts to establish standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| for dogs that live outdoors in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Without definitions, the interpretation is really left up to pet owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| animal control, law enforcement, and no one's really on the same page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| so having those established definitions is critically important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| in having a well-rounded animal control ordinance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| I did want to mention really quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| the group previous mentioned our website several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| and I did want to mention that our DEI department is in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| of fully rewriting and revamping that website content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| As many of you know, when you work for an organization that has many layers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| there are many folks that have to go through that approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| so the website information is in the process of being pulled down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| and replaced by updated standards and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| In the vast majority of cases, tethering is a result of inequality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| in access to resources and owners needing financial assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| not the intentional harm or cruelty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| The distinction is important so that we can move away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| from the idea of criminalizing poverty and demonizing pet owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| who face socioeconomic challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| Because most local governments are not in a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| to be able to provide large-scale resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| such as fence building and other resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| at no charge to wealth-deprived pet owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| HSUS encourages humane standards to improve the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| for dogs who live outdoors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| while understanding systematic inequalities experienced by far too many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| We support language that establishes clear guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| for dog owners and law enforcement officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| The elements that we feel are imperative to include in a definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| include what is adequate shelter, which this ordinance does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| requiring bedding during cold months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| requiring access to shade during the summer outside of that shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| and having a sanitary environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| as well as prohibiting the use of heavy chains, weighted chains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| and only allowing the use of safe restraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| attached to properly fitting collars and harnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| The intention of animal protection ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| should not be simply to punish those who are not in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| but to create a clear and responsible expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| for the humane treatment of dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| and build a positive, supportive relationship within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| We also encourage an education period as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| and a warning process that allows owners the ability to comply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| before more punitive measures are taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| As with many communities around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| Knoxville has a high rate of residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| confronted with serious struggles in accessing what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| and what they might need for their dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| About 24% of people in Knoxville live below the poverty line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| with thousands more hovering just above poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| disproportionately affecting those people of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| 42% of black and 35% of Latino Knoxvillians live in poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| compared to 21% of their white counterparts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| Additionally, 54% of Knoxville households rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| which has a direct impact on people and their pets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| due to rental restrictions and fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| This has been further compounded by the average rent in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| increasing close to 30% in just the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| resulting in extreme challenges for low-income individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| accessing affordable, stable, secure housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| While our hope is that every dog would be able to share the home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| with his or her family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| we understand that that is ultimately not always the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| So it's important to provide humane standards for care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| for those dogs who do live outdoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| without causing harm or financial hardship for pet owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| Oh, I'm sorry, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| The light is in between the two of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| so it's a challenge to figure out who it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Thank you for your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| In your view, is the proposed ordinance in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| with what you just shared with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| Do you feel like it strikes that balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| So I know that there have been multiple edits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| to those ordinance changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| What we are supporting is the humane standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| so not allowing chains, weighted tethers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| requiring properly fitted harnesses, no pinch, etc., etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| If that is what is currently in the draft, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| We do not support a full ban, but we do support humane standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1590)|
| 0:26:41| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| So there is an eight-page FAQ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| on the Humane Society of the United States website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| about tethering, and are you saying that's going away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Do you have a draft of what's coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Our DEI department is staying pretty tight with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| until it goes through legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| What is your time frame for this eight pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| of not supporting tethering coming forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| Yeah, so we're looking at within the summer time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1632)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Would someone from the national organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| be able to send us something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| saying that they're removing these pages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Yeah, so definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| It was something that we were in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| of drafting a letter for this department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| and our legal team wanted to just make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| that the wording complied with what DEI was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| So by the time in a few weeks or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| I can definitely have you a draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| if not for sure a letter detailing that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| I'd now like to welcome representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| from Knoxville's Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| Please state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| as well as let us know which organization you're with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Hi, my name is Sarah Glass, 4208 McCampbell Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| and I'm here to represent the Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| It's a fairly short presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| since so many things have already been covered before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| My fellow Animal Control Board members and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| have spent months discussing the issue about tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| researching, listening to other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| As you've heard, there are genuine concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| affecting animals that we see tied to fixed points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| with heavy chains, short leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| The visual image of that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| also makes tethering a highly emotional issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| for all of us who love animals and love our pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| The common goal that we share is to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| that pets are kept in humane, safe and comfortable conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| with enrichment beyond their basic needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| However, there is also much more to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| when it comes to the impact of the tethering ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| The Humane Society of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| warn of serious unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| of a hard-line approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Primarily, these bans criminalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| and disproportionately impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| low-income pet owners and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| We also know that a tethering ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| can lead to unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| that can be even worse for an animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| If a pet can't be kept outside on a tether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| it might be moved into the garage out of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| kept in a shed, kept in a crate for many hours a day inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| without access to fresh air, water or food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| We feel that the piece missing in this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| is the pet owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| and how owners can help fix this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| We'd like to shift our perspective to address that angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| We believe that the love of owners for their pets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| transcends socioeconomic circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| and cultural differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| People who keep pets outdoors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| are not necessarily bad or abusive owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| For example, Pets for Life is a Humane Society program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| that addresses inequities and lack of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| for low-income pet owners, as you heard before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| who lack access to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Young-Williams Animal Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| has similar programs to educate and provide help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| Our animal control officers can also help to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| and support pet owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| The last thing we want to do is go in and take those pets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| and take them into the shelter away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| try and fix the problem first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| We have learned that tethering often is a symptom of poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Many pet owners don't know another way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| or lack the resources to find a different solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Fifty-four percent of residents, as you heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| in the city of Knoxville are renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| and may not be allowed or able to afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| to keep their pets indoors or fence an outdoor space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| A different way to help these pets and owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| is to increase the required standards of shelter and care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| for outdoor pets, including humane tethering standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| such as trolleys, length of the tether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| access to dry shelter, fresh water, food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| and also maybe time limits in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| With this in place, our officers would have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| to help pets keep from being kept in inhumane conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| and make a long-term impact by educating the pet owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| Implementing these fixes would be a fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| and affordable solution as a complement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| to the existing organization working to build fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| So as we consider this, do you guys have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1896)|
| 0:31:46| Council Member Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| So I know you guys have discussed the proposed changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| which I guess, Ms. Gill, this packet is what you passed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| which is the proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| So Erin Gill, Chief Policy Officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| so Councilwoman Ryder, what you have is a packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| that our staff has prepared really simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| in support of Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| I want to be very clear that this is an attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| to summarize the changes that Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| has considered and provide them to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| in a somewhat digestible format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| I do not want to speak for Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| nor imply that that document, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| we're looking to the Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| to advise us as the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| in terms of those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| But in working with members and the chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| that is our staff's attempt to summarize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| and compile the full set of different additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| and modifications that have been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| as part of their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| I think now flipping through, I have some clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| The columns are labeled on this page, old and new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Since it doesn't carry over, I was confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| So, Ms. Glass, you guys have discussed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| a couple of different times at Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| I know I attended one of those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| and I went back and I looked at...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| I tried to find the minutes and agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| but you guys don't have minutes and agenda for your meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| So, but how many times have you guys discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| and you voted on changes that are in this packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| It has been a process over the past two years now, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| that we've been going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| We're trying to find some compromises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| to some of the verbiage that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| We definitely support increasing the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| We definitely need clear definitions of what shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| and humane conditions look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| Where we've run into discussions has been on the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| of a complete and total ban on tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| or only requiring supervised tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| It's such a nuanced issue because you can have the dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| that lives outside on a fixed-point chain 24-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| never comes inside, and on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| you can have someone whose dog lives primarily inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| but they put out on a run for four hours a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| so they can clean the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| So how do you balance those two things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| And a complete ban doesn't allow for some of the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| enrichment-based time that dogs can have outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| No, what do you mean by enrichment-based?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| So, well, case in point, I have a really old dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| She loves to sit on the couch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| but sometimes she just wants to go sit out in the sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| We are not fenced right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| We're in the process of taking down our fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| actually replacing a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| So sometimes she goes off the back porch on a lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| She can go lay out in the sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| With a complete ban, that is not allowed if I am not with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| So trying to come up with a compromise where we can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| the problems with unsanitary conditions and dogs living on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| fixed points and outside in extreme weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| A lot of the concerns I know they have with tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| are those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| We can fix those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| We can make better standards for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| I'll leave it for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| One thing that struck me reading through this was what would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| the impact on our unhoused neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| and I was wondering what is the current approach to regulating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2140)|
| 0:35:49| the care of animals and the care of people who are unhoused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| I unfortunately do not have that answer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| We do have an animal control officer here who might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Council Member Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| I can respond a little bit to that in that just from a young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| Williams perspective and through our pet resource center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| right now the biggest need that we're seeing is housing transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| either for unhoused individuals or people that are going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| as a result of COVID and just what's been identified as increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| in rent, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| So right now it's really just providing resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| We also have a program called Animal Haven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| which will house an animal for 30, 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| 90 days until somebody is able to find pet-friendly housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| But we also know a lot of our homeless individuals are terrific pet owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| and so a lot of times they just choose to stay on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| because they don't want to surrender their pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| So it's a mix of just trying to address the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| and providing assistance where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| I appreciate that, and I appreciate the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| because when I was reading the language and hearing the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| about creating a definition for adequate shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| it did make me think about our affordable housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| and that's one of my goals is for the city to adopt a definition for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| adequate shelter for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| And so I was kind of excited that we're having this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| but it made me think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| for those who do not view our current shelter as adequate shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| and so they choose to sleep on the streets for other reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| and some of those are to keep their dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| I would not want us to pass a measure that would have a negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| on that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| I have a question for the Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Just a couple questions from your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| There was discussion around low-cost fences that the nonprofit could provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| Can you talk about what the cost of those might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| Yeah, what's that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| I think I can just talk into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Actually, to date, all the fences that we have built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| have been absolutely free to the recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| It is a possibility that in the future we would come across a household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| that would qualify for a low cost versus a free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| but to date everything we have provided has been at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| What would low cost look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| It would probably depend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| it would absolutely depend on the size of the enclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| and the configuration of the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| But, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| probably around the same price as what they could do themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| except that our enclosures are a minimum of about 600 square feet per dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| So it would provide a larger area for the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Like $100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| $400?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| I mean, the cost to build a 150-square-foot enclosure is around $350,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| so probably around that, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| But the reality is that although that's a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| in all likelihood we will continue to build completely free fences for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| I just wanted some frame of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| And then the other question I had was some of the towns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| and the cities in Tennessee that you had referenced on one of the pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| 65 cities and 59 counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| and there was another page with a lot of different cities on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| There's a spectrum, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| by evidence of the Animal Control Board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| There's a spectrum here around what laws there are and what regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| and tethered or line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| What other options are there other than the one that you've proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| Well, first, just to clarify the slide with all the city names on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| those are cities that have full bans like we are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| So other options that some of the other cities have are they have time limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| So that might be you can't tether your dog between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| or you can only tether your dog for three hours or four hours or five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| The problem with those is just that they're not enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| because animal control would have to sit there and witness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| and watch for that entire period to ensure that that continuity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| that met that time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| There was also the one that would say prohibit fixed-point chaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| but would allow the pulley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| But as I discussed, Shelbyville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| had implemented a regulation like that, and they ended up rescinding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| Because it was ineffective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| It was not effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| It was difficult to implement, and it was just as safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| There were just as many safety issues for the dog as there were in fixed-point chaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2485)|
| 0:41:34| And there was one location that had a permit system to tether your dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| And I just want one question for Deputy Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| I just want to make sure I understand this document that we were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| This is just your effort to represent the Animal Control Board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2513)|
| 0:42:01| latest agreed approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| That is correct, and I don't want to speak for Chair Testerman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| in her role at Animal Control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| But, again, yes, we provide staff support to the Animal Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| and specifically Doug Gordon from our law department is their staff lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| and has been working with the Animal Control Board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| to think through the potential changes, whether that's definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| all the way through some of these more nuanced elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| And so, again, as that conversation has continued really for the better part of a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| this is, again, our staff attempt to try to consolidate that into a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| that council could review this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| And maybe as a segue, is this the final language that we're to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| or it sounds like this is still not final?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| It's still in evolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| There are things that still need to be fleshed out, but, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| it's been an ongoing conversation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| So, no, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| It's just there to represent sort of the iteration that's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| There's obviously been a lot of information presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| There's been a lot that the Animal Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| that I know a lot of us have had to absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| And, you know, the best path forward is unquestionably to improve the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2602)|
| 0:43:30| for our pets and for these outdoor pets by significantly updating the sheltering laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| which is also taking place at a state level in Tennessee currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| It just happened in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| It's getting ready to go in Georgia to support the humane standards of tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| and access to exercise and enrichment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| You know, increasing these requirements will not allow us to only better help inhumanely tethered pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| but also non-tethered pets who are kept outdoors in less than desirable conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2640)|
| 0:44:08| I will say we can't always dictate our standards and norms to those who have different experiences and realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2648)|
| 0:44:17| We've heard a lot of stats tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| The reality is that 24% of Knoxvilleans do live in poverty, and that's nearly 50,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2659)|
| 0:44:28| And if the national statistic of 47% of households own dogs is applied, that's nearly 15,000 low-income dog owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2668)|
| 0:44:39| You know, we've heard that, you know, that Mrs. Glass said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2679)|
| 0:44:47| tethering is a symptom of poverty, not of cruelty and neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| And ordinance is intended to change behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| And tethering is not about behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| It's about access and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Because they are renters or because they don't have the financial wherewithal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2702)|
| 0:45:09| or because there are three generations living in a house and a high-energy dog can't be around a grandparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2709)|
| 0:45:19| A total ban ordinance is a solution, a fill to an inaccurate problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| And tethering is not because of choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| It's because of a lack of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| You know, 80% of low-income pet owners in underserved communities have never reached out to a local agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2731)|
| 0:45:39| because they don't know that options and resources even exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| I mean, I see it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| They're afraid of being judged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| So the focus needs to be on education, on community outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| which translates to more bridge-building and establishing trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| And the solution is not to be punitive but instead to provide resources and alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| You create an ordinance that penalizes people, then they go underground, which deteriorates trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| And the consequence is fewer dogs get licensing, which is required in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| But more importantly, those pets don't get vaccinated because of the reporting structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| So it would also make it impossible for some residents to own an animal at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| And as stated, there's no socioeconomic or racial boundary to being a good pet owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2788)|
| 0:46:36| The one thing I know Durham was brought up as one of the example cities that does have a total ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2796)|
| 0:46:46| And the individual who drove that ordinance is now the Senior Director of Pets for Life for the Humane Society of the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2806)|
| 0:46:55| And as you heard, that program addresses inequity and lack of access to pet resources for those pet owners in underserved communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2815)|
| 0:47:06| And she would tell you if she were here that passing that total ban ordinance was a colossal mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| Her position changed when she started doing community outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| and she has now worked for more than 13 years to overcome that effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| and has even fought against the ordinance to support pet owners who have been cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| They have built 6,000 fences for families since 2006, started out building 10 a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| and now they're doing about two a month, 16 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| So if you draw a comparable to Knoxville based on population, that would be 3,300 fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| And at Durham's pace, that would take us nine years to build all the fences needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| And I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| But again, that doesn't take into consideration repairs, animals digging out, wear and tear, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| So, I mean, we can continue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| I would like to hear from Captain or Deputy Chief, I guess, Don Jones, who oversees animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2882)|
| 0:48:12| You know, just on call volume, and I know some stats are thrown out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| but, you know, I'd just like to hear from you and your stance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| because it's your men and women who are addressing this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| It's Captain Don Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| Knoxville Police Department, 800 Howard Baker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| Standing here listening, I can see from both sides I'm a pet partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| I don't call myself an owner because he bosses me around more than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2924)|
| 0:48:50| So I think we're going in the right direction when we think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| We've got to look at it, all the people out here that we're going to affect with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| And I know it's going to be strange when you hear this come from a law enforcement officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| but sometimes you can over-regulate, and it does tend to make people go underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| if they think they're going to get in trouble for something, because they're going to want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| People love their dogs, and they're going to want to keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| And if they think that we're going to be riding around looking for their dog, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| It bothers me to see a dog tethered, especially long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| because you do have all the bad behaviors you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| I've walked around enough backyards late at night, and a tethered dog comes out of a dog lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| and you're glad the chain stopped it because it was coming right at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| It does make them a little more aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| But I do see folks' problem if they want to have a pet partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| and being able to let it go out for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| When I was really small, we had hunting dogs, and we kept them in kennels in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| But since then, I've always had a dog, and it stayed in with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| And then I'd let it out for a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| because I've always been lucky enough to afford to put a fence in my backyard and let them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| But I do think that we have to have some clear—my folks need clear guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| on what is acceptable and unacceptable if we're going to go out and try to educate people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| because my animal control people do more educating than they do enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| They go out and they see a problem on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| They collect food donations to take out to people if they need food for their animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| So they're really committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| We get—in the last four months, we've had about 3,000 or so welfare checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| And out of those, we've found four dogs that were in imminent danger that we took to the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| so we could get that owner up to speed and be able to do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| And those all were tethered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| They were wrapped up in their chain and couldn't get loose or it was choking them or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| So there are the calls out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| And I can see if we were able to educate people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| My concern is a lot like yours, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| You've got folks out here that can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| Even a $350 fence, you might as well tell them it's $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| And I do think that we have to find some kind of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| And I'm glad I don't make the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| I just have to go out and interpret them and enforce them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| because it's tough to make them to where you can get everybody where you need them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| But it's a whole lot easier for us to enforce when my folks can go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| and there's a regulation that you can look at it and say, okay, that's a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| And we need to work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| But I do believe that education needs to be the first thing we try to do before we try to legislate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3120)|
| 0:52:09| Mr. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Did you say you had 3,000 calls and four dogs were removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| And was that removed because of tethering or removed for other reasons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| They were in danger of being injured worse than they already were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| Because of tethering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| That was part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| They couldn't get to food and water and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| There's been a lot of discussion around the root cause for why people tether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| Do we have any data that's collected in the city as to reasons given or maybe animal control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| The absolute most of the times you see it, it's just folks that are economically disadvantaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| and they don't have the ability or the wherewithal, and they're probably living in a rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3178)|
| 0:53:06| But they don't love their dogs any less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| But it's just that they don't have the wherewithal to be able to do what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| And they may have to work all day and the landlord doesn't let them keep an animal inside the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| so they have to keep it outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| And if there's not a fenced-in area for them to keep it, then they end up tethering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| Council Member Singh, did you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| I guess this is a question to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| I know all of our goals is to protect the dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| But I'm wondering, we're not saying that we don't want a dog to be on a tether for 10 minutes or for two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3229)|
| 0:53:59| but we're talking about the dire situations, the extreme situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| So if this is a complaint-driven ordinance, in a sense, someone has to complain before you guys will be called out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3244)|
| 0:54:14| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| So if you're called out and the situation is mild, the end of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3256)|
| 0:54:26| Is this a way to at least have some laws on the books so that when there are extreme, horrible situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3266)|
| 0:54:34| at least something can be done about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| That would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| I think what we have to figure out is a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| And we have to educate the public about it first, not just go out and as soon as it's passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| we go out and start inspecting people's backyards and handing out citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| I think it's something that we have to, as we move forward, we have to educate folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| Is this where we're headed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| And give them the resources that everybody's identified in here today, and all of them are wonderful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| to where you could go get some assistance, some help, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| But I think you don't need to legislate something so strict that it's hard for people to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3313)|
| 0:55:21| And that will set it up for failure, I do believe, down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3321)|
| 0:55:31| Did you have a follow-up, Council Member Stanton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| So, Captain Jones, so you said you had 3,000 calls per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| Roughly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| No, that was just in the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| Or what are we batching as 3,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| What falls under the umbrella of those 3,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| What are you counting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| That's welfare calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| All kinds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| It could be anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| It could be a loose dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| It could be running around the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| We were able to find four times where the dog was in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| Some of them had tethers or leads wrapped around their neck, but not all of the four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| No, not all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| A lot of times we go out and they've got water, they've got shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| It's just somebody else's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| They don't think the dog should be chained up in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| But there was nothing that kept the dog or the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| So you're getting calls that are complaints about a dog chained up in a yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| That's part of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| That's not all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| But it's perfectly legal to do it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| And that's what you convey once that inspection is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Can I ask a question about, and this may be for Officer Hogue, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| So there have also been animals recently, like I think recently there was a dog that was killed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| that was on a lead by other dogs in a dog fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| I just wanted some clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| You've got the details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| Yeah, we had two dogs that were running loose one night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| and they went in the backyard of this one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| The dog was chained up, and they managed to kill the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| The loose dogs killed the dog on the chain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Yeah, two dogs attacked the one dog and ended up killing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| And then later on that night there was the same two dogs came across another dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3456)|
| 0:57:46| I think it had to be put down to the severely injured for them attacking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3466)|
| 0:57:53| And that's one of the problems with the dogs being tethered to a fixed object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| Also, if you put them in a fence, if it was running loose in a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3478)|
| 0:58:04| the same thing could have happened because we've had calls where dogs have climbed fences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| to get into the yards to attack other dogs too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Right. That's why I don't leave my dogs outside, even though I have a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| Well, you can, but I mean, depending on where you're patrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| I know I legally can. I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| I've been part of a dog attack, so I get a little real fearful about dog attacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| My dog was mauled by a dog on a leash, and it's a horrible experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| I'm actually afraid to walk down the sidewalk next to chain dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| They might break loose because that dog broke loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| It was a very, very horrible experience. I didn't sleep for about two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Also, too, when they're tethered up, when you have to go get the dog if it's tethered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| it's a lot harder to get it because they're a lot more aggressive towards you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| because you're protecting that one little area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Right, their turf that they're allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Once you get them off your turf, then they're like your best friend almost sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3538)|
| 0:59:06| Like he was saying, the 3,600 calls that we've gotten have been since October 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| up until the 15th of February, and most of them were with loose dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3552)|
| 0:59:21| The welfare checks that people called in were basically like 399 of them were for no shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| or they're calling about the chain being too short or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| We get a lot of those calls, which a lot of them are unfounded because they do have shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| A lot of times some of these people are calling in to complain just to harass their neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| because they don't want the dog there or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| But there have been four cases here that we had to confiscate the dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| for either the chain being tangled up to where it couldn't move at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| and the owner's not being home, so we'd end up having to cut the chain stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| and we'd have to take it just because we couldn't let it run loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| So unsupervised tethering where they were getting entangled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| As far as the tethering part, with these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| personally I don't have a problem with them on a runner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| If it's on a runner, because even though other dogs, if they're going to get in a fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| they can still maneuver a lot more to protect themselves than on a fixed object tied to a tree or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3629)|
| 1:00:37| But it's going to be difficult to have people stay out there and supervise their dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| when it's on an outside, go to the bathroom, because they're going to be wanting to do stuff in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3643)|
| 1:00:51| So it can be worded as such that they keep an eye, they maintain checking on the dog consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3651)|
| 1:01:01| So supervised tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| But not being outside with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| They may be inside doing laundry or fixing dinner or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| They'll just put the dog out there to go to the bathroom, but the people won't stay out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| For us to confiscate the animal just because they're violating the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| our problem comes across basically, if it's not jeopardizing its life or public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| is that we're supposed to need to get a seizure warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| But they will not issue us a seizure warrant for a city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3694)|
| 1:01:42| Who would issue that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| You said they won't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| It's the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| The state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| So the four dogs that you did have to take, what's that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| The dogs we don't have to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| No, the dogs you did take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| The four that you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| We took those because we would have to cut the chain on their lead because they were tangled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3722)|
| 1:02:10| They didn't have no shelter at all, no shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| So you didn't have to have a warrant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| No, because it's for their safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Versus violating a local ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| When the owners come down to get them, we'll cite them for improper restraint or no shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| But a lot of times if the people are at home, then we'll have them correct the violation or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3748)|
| 1:02:37| We've got stuff that we will give them from our supplies to help with keeping the dogs secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3757)|
| 1:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Thank you for the clarification and extra details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| Oh, Officer Hogue, can you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| Keith Hogue, 3918 Windsor Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3779)|
| 1:03:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| Captain Jones, can you walk through what happens when you do have to take a dog away from the home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3788)|
| 1:03:15| Well, my officers take them to Young Williams to be housed until we can find the owner or the owner calls for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3795)|
| 1:03:23| And then we deal with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| It's difficult when somebody's not in the home when they have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| And that's what they would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| The normal procedure would take them to Young Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| They hold them there until we can locate the owner to come get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| And then we deal with it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| What I'm curious about is dealing with it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| Is there a scenario where the dog's kept away from the home until there's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| Well, we would cite them to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| And then Judge Rawson...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| I'll do that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| Yeah, Judge Rawson would lay down what they need to do to improve the conditions there so they can keep housing the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| And are there certain...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| I've gone through a similar situation with a dog that has gotten loose in a neighborhood...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| ...fighting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Walk through what are the requirements for someone to get the dog back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| It's whatever that Judge Rawson sets in the courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Whether it be making it more secure for that dog so it can't get away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| It's sort of like with the dangerous dog ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| I had one question for Ms. Heider with the Humane Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3869)|
| 1:04:37| Did I pronounce your name right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Heider, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Heider, okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Sorry, it was my East Tennessee long eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| I understand that the Humane Society is working through their new updated policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| and probably is going to consider all the scenarios, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| generally speaking, a fixed-point tethered dog for 12, 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3893)|
| 1:05:02| does the Humane Society have a perspective simply on whether that's humane or inhumane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3902)|
| 1:05:10| I do not have that information other than we have a preference for having a run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3910)|
| 1:05:21| We've not said this is a better option than this option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| but our preference would be a trolley-style, run-style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3926)|
| 1:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| The unsupervised fixed tethering for 12, 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3941)|
| 1:05:49| I don't hear anybody advocating for that being a humane thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| I'm just talking out loud a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| My perspective in that the big challenge, as I've understood it from everybody that has weighed in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| is that poverty and lack of resources or knowledge of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| is a lot of the reasons that these circumstances happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| And I know we can't, but it seems that there's a non-profit that's willing to provide free resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3974)|
| 1:06:21| when that situation happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| I know we can't put that into an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| but if the biggest barrier, and there's common agreement on what's inhumane for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| and there's a commitment for resources for people to remedy that without the dog being taken away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| because we all love our dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| it seems as though everybody involved can find some scenarios where it's clearly inhumane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| there's enough teeth in it for Captain Jones' team to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| but it gives people a way to remedy the situation when they don't have resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| So it seems like there's a pathway forward here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| I'm not going to state what it is, but it seems like there's a pathway forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| I have a question for Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| Because it's kind of a Young-Williams question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| but when a pet is brought to Young-Williams and held because it's being kept in inhumane conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4044)|
| 1:07:37| is there currently a bond required to be paid for those homeowners to reclaim their pet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4057)|
| 1:07:45| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| So a lot of that's set by ordinance on an intake fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| and then there's a daily fee to care for these animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| If it's a cruelty charge, then we hold that animal until it goes through the judicial process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4077)|
| 1:08:08| So it's a little bit complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| but one thing that we do is we try and institute care bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| or care bonds for animals that come in, especially for an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| Now, that said, we have the ability to help waive some or all of those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| We have a spay or pay program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| If they choose to spay or neuter their animal, then we will reduce those fees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| So we have the ability based on financial hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| but there are fees that are set by ordinance when those animals come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| and they're there for a day or a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| Do you have any sense of how many pet owners are not able to reclaim their pets because of that fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| It's not really because of the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| I mean, sometimes it is, especially if it's a court case and a restitution case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| then they will surrender a pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| Our goal is to keep pets with their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| And so if that, you know, in the best interest of the pet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| and sometimes it's decided by the court, sometimes it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| but, you know, length of stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| I mean, we want these animals out of the shelter as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| but our goal ultimately is to keep pets with their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| Yeah, so I'm just trying to get clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| because we have ten pages of proposed old and new language that was passed out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4176)|
| 1:09:45| So I'm trying to identify what parts of this are up for debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| because it's my understanding that in November we had an ordinance that was on the council agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| but then was removed before it came to council after it had been to the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| So which part of the ten pages is up for change since the animal control board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| where it was discussed and voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| That's a part I'm trying to identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| That is currently where it stands right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| I mean, but again, it is not a completely black-lined ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| There is still evolving discussion that is taking place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| and that's why it did not move forward in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| I guess, can we have copies of the parts that are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| Can we have an indication of what's up for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Is it all ten pages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Well, if you look on the right side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| there's either a column that says what's being removed or what's being added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| Added, it's not always in place of, it's new content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| So the new column, like adequate space, redefining animal, defining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4253)|
| 1:11:01| So the first page is definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| And redefining some of those definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| and also making them more well-defined than what a lot of those definitions arbitrarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4269)|
| 1:11:22| Okay, so like on page five, there's a section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| So we didn't have anything about impoundment of uncared animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| Is that uncared for animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| On page five of this packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| Which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| On page five of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| It says 519, impoundment of uncared animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| We currently have nothing in the code that talks about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| so there's nothing in the old column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| but the new column has a section on impoundment of uncared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| I'm assuming for animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| And so this is what's being proposed or considered to cover uncared for animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| Impoundment of uncared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Yes, there is some language that's currently in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| It's very convoluted and confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| So that language, as far as expenses, et cetera, they're related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| It's just clarifying some that's not even on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| Okay, and then on the bottom of page six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| it's replacement of the section that talks about food and access to water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4355)|
| 1:12:45| I'm just looking through it, trying to understand what questions I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| since that's the purpose of the workshop is to have the chance to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| while you guys are crafting what you're going to put on an agenda, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| Yeah, I mean, basically a lot of this is elevating the standards of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| which is really what the dialogue needs to be and what's enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| and really about sheltering standards of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| Food, water, shelter, shade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| Okay, so the tethering part is on page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| Okay, and that's a part that you're still discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| or this is the current consideration from the Animal Control Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| Is the section on page eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| All of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| All ten pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| But the section about tethering is the section on page eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| And Council Member Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| I would say that basically until an ordinance comes to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4432)|
| 1:13:59| and we vote on it and pass it on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| then pretty much everything is up for debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| Really our purpose today is to learn more about these issues that have been raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| and to begin this legislative process as we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| We're going to hear back eventually from the Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| about their recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| and this is a good opportunity for us to have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| think about what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| Who was next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| I just want to say that not supporting a total ban does not mean we don't care about our animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4477)|
| 1:14:46| I mean, a lot of us get up every day to address animal welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| So I feel like that's a false equivalency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| There's no question that tethering happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| but there are more effective ways to address the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| which results in fewer dogs being tethered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| better relationships as well as more sustainable solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| Some fixes may not be perfect, but perfect can't be the enemy of the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| There will always be bad actors and people who don't care about their animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| but the vast majority do love their animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| and we can't create policy for the small percentage of ill-intended people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| And when those cruelty and neglect cases happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| we already have state laws on the books to support and prosecute those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| Sometimes a conversation and intent is more about the pets than the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| but it should be about how we keep pets with their people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| After all, people do better, pets do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| And moving from sight and seize to educate and assist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| which is what animal control as a whole across the country is moving to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| I know you mentioned a path forward, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| I'm all about chain-free Knoxville and building fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| I went back to Durham Stats and the period of time that it took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| to build the number of fences that the demand had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| So there's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| So definitely support that, but it's meeting the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| But at the same time, we're prevented from helping many tethered pets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| because the local sheltering standards are too low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| and that's really at the core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| I mean, the majority of this proposed ordinance, we all agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| we all want to elevate the standards of care for these animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| And it gives animal control officers the opportunity to remove pets who are truly abused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| or support and educate pet owners who just lack the resources and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| So I encourage the chain-free Knoxville team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| and I encourage other local animal welfare advocates to continue building fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| If you have a community working together and you're building fences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| and you're addressing the need, whether it's Pet Resource Center of Young Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| whether it's chain-free Knoxville, whether it's other advocacy groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| at the end of the day, a mandate really wouldn't be needed if you're addressing the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4655)|
| 1:17:41| And together we can help pets and people and pet owners solve the issue as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| So it's a complex and complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| You look at things, even we are a pet-friendly city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| and you look at things like Free Rivers Co-op.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| They have tethering poles out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| You look at downtown restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| I mean, you have to type your dog in order to go inside to order food, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| And I know that's like, well, that should be allowed, but under a total ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| that would be in violation of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| And so you can't pick and choose who's impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| I mean, that becomes discriminatory logic at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| So, again, there's a lot to weigh, but, again, I think elevating standards of shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4707)|
| 1:18:36| humane standards of tethering, of fixed-point tethering, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| there's a lot of verbiage in the proposed ordinance that really restricts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| what a humane standard of tethering is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| I have a question for the Knoxville Airlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| Based on your proposal earlier, how does it differ from this package?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| We have not been afforded the opportunity to review that or contribute to that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| We actually attended the Animal Control Board meeting on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| and I don't believe that there were any final decisions made on the path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| And I would also like to add that the proposed language includes language to allow for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| temporary tethering of a dog outside a commercial establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4766)|
| 1:19:34| The crux of the matter, it seems, is the definition of what's humane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4774)|
| 1:19:42| You're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| You're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| Check your chair arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| I'm going to try this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| I think that the definition of what's humane, I think, is at the crux of the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| and I think that there are some scenarios that we can all agree on are not humane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| and can be remedied with free resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| So I would encourage everybody in pursuit of this to focus on that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4807)|
| 1:20:15| of where you can all agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| I think I understand, after Councilwoman Tesserman made some comments there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| I understand a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| So the packet that we've been given are conditions for tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| and the part that the Animal Control Board was discussing is whether to have a total ban on tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4834)|
| 1:20:42| or to have some conditions for tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| So what we're missing in this, so there's no new and old column,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| there's nothing in the current ordinance about tethering, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| But we don't have the ordinance that you guys discussed at the Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| to compare to what you're proposing in this packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| So I don't know what the difference is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| You keep referencing total ban, and I don't have anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| I have this list of conditions for tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| I don't have a compare-contrast to understand what the crux, the meat of the discussion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| is what I'm saying, other than what people are verbally saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| Right, and that conversation is still going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| But as it stands, the conversation has been that as far as a total ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| the overall conversation has been there are more effective ways than a total ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| because of the unintended consequences of a lot of our low-income pet owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4898)|
| 1:21:47| which is a substantial amount of them being impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| So a total ban, even fence building, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| you've got landlords that aren't going to allow for fences to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| Part of the criteria of chain-free Knoxville, which I fully support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| is that an animal that has a fence has to be spayed or neutered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| A lot of pet owners are not going to concur with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| So then what happens to those animals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| They have to be surrendered or confiscated, and they can't live inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| Or they go underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| If there's a mandated tether, they potentially go in a tool shed, a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| They're not, unfortunately, going to be sleeping cozily on someone's bed, generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| So they may be in a crate for 12 to 14 hours a day or long periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| So, again, those are the concerns that what the dialogue is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4961)|
| 1:22:49| is the impact on our low-income, underserved communities and pet owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| So the total ban that you guys discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| it allowed for people's animals to be taken away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| If they're not compliant, you have an animal that's tethered outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| and they don't comply, then ultimately they will either surrender to the shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| because they don't have the resources to build a fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| and they can't bring an animal inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| A lot of landlords don't allow pets inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| or they charge ridiculous pet deposits, very high pet deposits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| So that precludes animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| And it also precludes people from even being able to adopt an animal at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| if they don't have alternatives to keeping an animal inside all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| or part of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| So, again, they're, you know, and that's then saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| well, because you can't afford this, then you don't deserve a pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| And a lot of people in these situations truly love their animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| even though, you know, they don't have alternatives or options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| other than an animal living outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| I had a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Captain Jones, if you would, we've talked a lot about tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5053)|
| 1:24:20| and, you know, you had mentioned and referenced some experiences you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| you know, I guess it was from a period of time from October to February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| where you had noticed some, you had four, I think, instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| where there was maybe some tethering but other issues that were going on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| I guess my question is, in your experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| have you seen evidence of tethering over a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| evidence of other types of animal cruelty that might be going on at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5086)|
| 1:24:53| or is it, are those completely independent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| Now, I don't want you to get the idea that just tethering an animal is mistreating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| There are people that do that, that do mistreat their animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| and I've run into them in my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| It's been a long career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| But in the situations we just outlined in these last four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| they had their chain was tangled up or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| no indication that they were being mistreated other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| but we couldn't leave them there with nobody at the house to fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| so we had to take the animal until we could locate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| So we couldn't free the animal and just let it run loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| You're not seeing an association with either tethering in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| or the amount of time that tethering is going on with other types of issues that are going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5141)|
| 1:25:47| Well, I don't have any hardcore facts to give you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| Just other than my basic knowledge from years of doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| most of the really mean dogs that I've ever run up on late at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| when I'm checking somebody's house were the ones that are chained up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| and they're pretty much there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| And then with regard to tethering and your experience in that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5169)|
| 1:26:17| I think there was some reference earlier about maybe a chained dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| becoming more aggressive or being more frequent to potential biting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| because of interrupting that fight-or-flight instinct that the dog would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| if you take away one of them, then the other one's going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| Is your experience that tethering for some period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5201)|
| 1:26:46| or long periods of time increases aggressiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| or the chances of biting from an animal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| Well, I think just from being a pet partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| any time that they're taken away from where they can socialize with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| and other animals in a safe environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| they become a little more fearful of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| And the fear is not that they're mean, it's just they're afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5231)|
| 1:27:19| And with regard to noise complaints you might hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| I would imagine, especially if a dog is not comfortable where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| they might start barking, making noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| Do you get more noise complaints because of dogs that are tethered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| or do you have any relationship between those two things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5259)|
| 1:27:43| No, I don't think we've got one more or the other on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5263)|
| 1:27:50| A dog could be living out in the backyard fenced in with a dog house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| and everything else in the middle of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| It just may be a barker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| And people will call and say, next door neighbor's dog is barking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| You're going to knock on the door and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| could you make your dog not bark so much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Well, and then the final thing I had for you is with regard to enforceability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| and you're out doing this now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| what is it that you need to come from ultimately from counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| if there's an ordinance change here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| What do you need to see from counsel to give you that clarity with regard to tethering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| And the short answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| Whatever my folks have to go out and do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| they have to be able to look at something and say this is or isn't allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| Whether it's temporary supervised tethering, somebody has to be at the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| if you tether the dog outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| then if my officers get there and there's nobody there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| and the dog's tethered outside, then that's a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| But if you just say, okay, you can't tether the dog at all, that's a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5340)|
| 1:29:08| But you have to be clear as to what the violation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| for my folks to understand it when they get on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| So my follow-up question then is what would be clear from an enforcement perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5356)|
| 1:29:24| Is a total ban, we're not doing this at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| if we see it then it's an issue with a warning or whatever ends up being discussed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| I'm just trying to get at what clarity you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| Or is it, I don't know, when you get a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| do you have time to pull up and wait 15 minutes to see if something happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| I'm just throwing out a number, I'm not proposing a change, I'm just suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| I need to get the parameters of what clarification you need to have this be enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| A total ban is pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| That's enforceable just when you get out of the car and there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| But if you, whatever limits, if you wanted to put time limits on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5406)|
| 1:30:13| you know, you could say from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., those are easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| But just like they were saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| you can't tether it for more than four hours unsupervised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| well that would take one of my folks to have to sit outside the house for four hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| to see if it was sitting there for four hours unsupervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| So that would be more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| It does, it does, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| So if there was ever a consideration of a time limit for unsupervised tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| how much time would be reasonable from the perspective of enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5445)|
| 1:30:56| Any time you put on it, you know, if you want to say two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| somebody's going to have to sit there for two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| If you want to say 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| somebody's going to have to sit there for 30 minutes to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| It makes it a little more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| As opposed to a time frame, you know, from here to here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| they can't be tethered outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Okay, so that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| So from an enforcement perspective, the amount of time that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| you'd have to sit there, you said four hours, two hours, 30 minutes, 10 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| somebody's going to have to spend that time waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| So from an enforcement piece, you're saying from this time of day to that time of day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| in this weather condition and that weather condition, that would be easier for you to do enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| That's a whole lot easier to enforce, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| And I appreciate that because I think that helps us kind of get around what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5508)|
| 1:31:55| with regard to how we deal with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| I had a question for Ms. Hayter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| Hayter, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| So with regard to tethering and weather conditions, my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5537)|
| 1:32:26| are different breeds and ages and health conditions for dogs going to change what type of environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5546)|
| 1:32:34| they might be able to be in a healthy condition if they were outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| So, I mean, you know, depending on the size of an animal or the breed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| you are going to have different adjustments to cold weather, hot weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5565)|
| 1:32:53| Short snout dogs have a hard time exercising in hot weather because of the short snout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| just the way that they've been bred compared to other dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| So that also goes to an effect when you're talking about cold weather versus hot weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| I mean, all animals need access to a shelter that can provide them the ability to maintain a proper body heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5588)|
| 1:33:18| But as far as, you know, what temperature does a chihuahua get cold at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| versus what temperature does a mastiff get cold at, you know, you're going to get, you know, it's going to vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| So there's not, I can't tell you, you know, at XYZ temperature, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| all breeds are going to be, you know, responding the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| Not to say that they don't all need access to adequate shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| And then I had a question for the Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5627)|
| 1:33:54| So you all talked about, you know, the fences being $350 that you could, that Chain Free can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5634)|
| 1:34:05| How many of those fences have been provided in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| Actually, sir, what we said is that if an individual wanted to build their own enclosure of 150 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| then the approximate cost to build that with the six-foot panels is around $350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| However, all the fences we've provided thus far have been free to the recipients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| and we have freed 15 dogs from chains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| We only just started a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| And I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| So you've got 15 dogs that you were able to provide fencing for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| Do you have a wait list for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| We do have a wait list, and it's not that long right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| but we get inquiries virtually every day about our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| And I would also like to note that we have been working with Animal Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| and they do provide information about Chain Free to residents that they feel might be interested in that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5700)|
| 1:35:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| I just wanted to clarify something, I guess either for the administration, Mr. Gordon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| and then I guess after that the Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| There's nothing that's been recommended either or approved or discussed by either the Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| or subsequently the Animal Welfare Alliance that would create a new circumstance to take a dog away from an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5738)|
| 1:35:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| I'll look to Mr. Gordon, but, no, we have pretty limited tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| You talked about city ordinance in terms of seizure of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| so anything that relates to seizure of property really relates to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| There's nothing in this ordinance that authorizes the taking away of an animal against the owner's will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| The owner would have to consent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| There's language in this ordinance that talks about taking a dog into custody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| and what you can do when you take it into custody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| When that dog is taken into custody, that's an owner surrendering that animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| Now, the officer, Captain Jones, when he spoke and he talked about the four dogs that were seized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| he did that under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| It's animal cruelty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| And so we already have a statute, a criminal law, in place that when a dog is suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5797)|
| 1:36:45| when a dog is bleeding, it's choking, it's tangled up and, I don't know, it's suffering somehow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5805)|
| 1:36:55| the officers are authorized to take that dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| They can seek a warrant if they need to, but in pretty much all of these circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| there are exigent circumstances that they have to act now in order to save that dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| What we're talking about here is a civil ordinance that is a lower standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| than the dog is suffering and needs veterinary care right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| or it's going to die or get seriously injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| I just wanted to clarify that tonight there's not been any new measure introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| by any group, party, organization, committee, board about taking animals away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| new reasons to take an animal away, and the state law prohibits us from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| State law prohibits us from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| So I was able to find in my email from October what we were emailed from Ms. Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| and I guess part of my confusion is there's a lot of terminology that's new to some of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| Not all of us work in animal welfare, serve on the Animal Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| so thank you to those who do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| So there's supervised tethering and unsupervised tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| but then I also heard tonight total ban on tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| So nothing that's been discussed is a total ban on tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| I think I'm just trying to understand the differences in supervised, unsupervised, and total ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5903)|
| 1:38:30| and I think I recall, Mr. Gordon, from the Animal Control Board meeting that I was at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| you were discussing the inability to take animals and, like, not being able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5916)|
| 1:38:45| That's not something that we could put in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| If you don't do X, we take your dog away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| So that's the part I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| If they had unsupervised tethering, then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| We issue a $50 ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Per the state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| A court can only issue a 50 or it can only fine up to $50 unless a jury is impaneled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5945)|
| 1:39:13| This body passes laws that are enforced through city court, and city court does not impanel a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5953)|
| 1:39:21| Therefore, the maximum fine that can be issued is $50 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| Now, you could issue, officers could issue a fine every day for when this happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| but that's the limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| There's no authority to seize the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| As far as, you know, supervised tethering, I would equate that with a total ban for the reasons that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5983)|
| 1:39:56| it goes back to people who don't have other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| and the reality of somebody being able to sit outside and just watch and supervise their pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6002)|
| 1:40:11| First of all, the enforceability of that would be very difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| but it goes back to, you know, penalizing people who don't have other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| who work for a living, whose lifestyles don't allow themselves just to be outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6021)|
| 1:40:34| Or I go back to, it's a beautiful Saturday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| You're inside cleaning your house or doing maintenance or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| and your pet is outside enjoying the sun and enrichment of being outdoors and exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6046)|
| 1:40:53| but if you're not out there, you would be in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| So, again, it's so restrictive that essentially would be a total ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| And I just go back to the high percentage of residents who are renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6063)|
| 1:41:10| I go back to, you know, options and, you know, resources versus, you know, punitive efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6070)|
| 1:41:24| Council Member Tester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| I had a question for Knoxville Animal Welfare Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| So, we've talked a lot about tethering today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| and it seems like everyone is in agreement that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| having better increased standards is a good idea and that we all want to see that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| But the issue that the Animal Control Board is wrestling with and ultimately council would wrestle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| with something coming to us to vote is about tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| So, from your all's perspective, are you proposing a total ban?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| Are you proposing supervised tethering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| Are you thinking about time-limited tethering or weather conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| You know, where are you all coming from from that perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| Well, sir, in our research before we started working on the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| we looked at every single one of those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| And ultimately, our research led us to conclude that the most effective means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| to eliminate 24-7 permanent tethering is a complete ban on unsupervised tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| And so that is what we do support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| Unfortunately, having a ban between certain hours, like 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6169)|
| 1:42:58| unfortunately, is not enforceable because our Animal Control Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| one, is complaint-driven, and two, has minimal staffing during those hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| So, therefore, somebody would have to be able to visually see in the middle of the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| a dog chained up and call, and then we would have to have the resources to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| and actually respond to that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| So the reality is that people could chain their dogs to 11 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| and then continue to chain their dogs all night long without anyone ever being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| the Animal Control ever being able to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| And then, of course, the time limits, like the officer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| like the captain said, they would have to literally sit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| and physically witness that for that entire period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| And, again, the Animal Control Department doesn't have the manpower to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| Okay. So what you're really asking for is a ban, not on tethering totally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| but just on unsupervised tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| Okay. And the issue that Animal Control Board is wrestling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| is whether or not to have that type of ban or any type of ban with regard to tethering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6246)|
| 1:44:16| There's definitely, on page 6, there's definitely conditions for tethering that are being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6256)|
| 1:44:24| But I guess my question is, is there any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| were there folks that were in favor of considering some type of tethering ban that was unsupervised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6271)|
| 1:44:39| Or, you know, what were we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| So just as I mentioned, the conversation has really equated supervised tethering with a total ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6281)|
| 1:44:51| And HSUS, as well as ASPCA, would concur that that equates to a total ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| So, again, that is really what we've grappled with because of the unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6298)|
| 1:45:06| of so many of our low-income residents and pet owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| And so, again, with national agencies like HSUS, ASPCA as well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6311)|
| 1:45:19| does not support a total ban, but humane standards of tethering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| which would include no fixed-point tethering, which would include pulley and trolley systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| But it really goes back to the dialogue, shifting the dialogue from tethering to raising the standards of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6330)|
| 1:45:38| including shelter, access to water, food, shelter, shade, and elevating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| Because going back to the animal control calls of, you know, almost 3,700 calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| 399 were welfare checks, four of those were tethered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6350)|
| 1:45:57| More than 200 of them were about adequate shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| So that's what we're really focused on, looking at those standards and elevating that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| And definitely looking through the packet that we were provided, there's a lot of really good updates in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| Some of the language really is very much so needs to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| Like I say, I mean, I think, you know, we would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| I mean, the majority of, you know, what we've walked through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| it's really about a total ban versus humane standards of tethering because of the implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6388)|
| 1:46:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| So of the calls that Captain Jones and Officer Hogue spoke to and the four animals that were removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6401)|
| 1:46:50| or went to the shelter maybe temporarily because they were entangled in their tethers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| was there instruction or education given to folks when the dogs came back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| Is there safe tethering, I guess is my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6421)|
| 1:47:07| Just people came and claimed their dogs and they retethered them the same way they were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| Is there some education that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| I guess I'm asking you for very specifics, and if you can't answer that tonight, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| Yeah, if we charge them with cruelty charge, state cruelty charge, they don't get the dog back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| And so the court, the state court says they can have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| But if we charge them and they're found guilty, they don't get the dog back at all then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| They have to part with surrendering the dog to Young-Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| But as far as if it's just like the ones that we confiscated there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6458)|
| 1:47:45| they were issued a citation for city court, and they were given the dog back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| but they were given instructions on how to properly, you know, restrain the dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6471)|
| 1:47:58| and make sure the area is clean of debris because a lot of times when they chain them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| there's going to be a lot of debris around, and that's what they'll get tangled up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| So plus, you know, we end up doing follow-up calls on them when we return the dogs to them like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6488)|
| 1:48:15| to make sure that the violation has been corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6495)|
| 1:48:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| That was the last of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| I hear what Councilwoman Testerman is saying about safe tethering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6508)|
| 1:48:33| and putting your dog out while you're doing things in your house because that's your option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| I just don't do that because it's not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| In the times maybe that a dog or a puppy has been tethered for short terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| they end up entangled in the tether, and so I don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| I also don't leave my dogs out in the yard because I live in a very urban environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6532)|
| 1:48:58| and I've heard stories about some pretty tragic things happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| You know, you have an alley to the backyard, and other people will do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| or throw things in your yard to make your dog sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| So I don't leave my dogs out unsupervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| It's just not in their best interest, and I can't be comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| And in terms of tethering my animal at Through Rivers Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| because we walk over there with the dogs and tether them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| I will usually have one of my children supervise them on the tether at Through Rivers Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| because having been involved in a dog-on-dog attack, I can't leave my dogs unsupervised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6567)|
| 1:49:33| because I can't feel comfortable that another animal is not going to attack them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| So it's focused on what is in the best interest of the dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| And the only thing I'll say is also in the regards of not having finances to fence a dog in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6584)|
| 1:49:56| I grew up dirt poor in a single wide trailer, and we never tethered a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6596)|
| 1:50:03| And it may be hard for people to believe because I certainly can afford to take care of dogs now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| but we never tethered a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| We honestly couldn't afford to have a dog, but we never tethered them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| I just don't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| And I appreciate that, and I completely understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| I mean, my dogs aren't outside either, ever, unless I'm with them or they're leashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6628)|
| 1:50:35| I don't even have a backyard that I could fence, theoretically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6635)|
| 1:50:41| But that said, I go back to that we can't dictate our standards and norms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6641)|
| 1:50:49| I want to see dogs inside, on the sofa, sleeping in the bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6649)|
| 1:50:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| But we all have different experiences and realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| And, again, the dialogue about just the pet, it's got to be much broader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6663)|
| 1:51:11| It's got to be about the people, too, and the pet owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| because it is that human-animal bond that is so important across every socioeconomic racial boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6675)|
| 1:51:24| and that has to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| And, again, it's access and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| And these pets, because they're outside, the vast majority don't love them any less than you do or that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6692)|
| 1:51:39| And, again, it is education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| It's outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| It's resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| And as a community, if we can do that, theoretically, we don't need a mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| And so we have had to shift the dialogue around animal welfare from not just the pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6711)|
| 1:52:05| And I've learned that over the last many years as we developed a pet resource center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| because we needed to start establishing the dialogue with pet owners, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| And, for instance, why people surrender their pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| Forty percent don't want to surrender their pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| They just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| They're out of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| They don't know they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| So that is a huge need that we are working to meet in this community, and this plays into it exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6744)|
| 1:52:34| Can I just clarify something really quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| We also weren't allowed to have pets in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| So they weren't inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| They weren't in our beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| They weren't on our couch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| They just weren't tethered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| They were in a kennel, a large one, sizable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6762)|
| 1:52:47| You don't have to have resources to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| I just wanted to emphasize much of what Councilwoman Testerman said, and I'll try to keep it quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6773)|
| 1:53:01| because I hope we get to leave soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| But I've had dogs all my life, and I'm very sensitive to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6785)|
| 1:53:12| And I definitely want us to reach a conclusion that's in the best interest of the animals in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6792)|
| 1:53:20| But I agree with Councilwoman Testerman that we have to acknowledge the impact on an animal when you remove them from their owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6800)|
| 1:53:32| And I think that's a really critical piece that we have to keep in mind when we're talking about the best interest of an animal's welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6812)|
| 1:53:43| I'm also concerned about things that I didn't bring up tonight, but I brought up with the alliances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6823)|
| 1:53:52| If we see more pets being taken, I know that Young-Williams does all that they can to fund new homes for animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6832)|
| 1:54:05| but I don't believe it's a 100% no-kill shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| And so that's something to keep in mind, is if we put more emphasis on enforcement rather than the community education piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-220217?start=6850)|
