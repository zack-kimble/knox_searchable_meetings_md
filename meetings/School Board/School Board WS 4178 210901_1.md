| 2:09:37| and taking the reins, no matter the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| percentage of death in kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7779)|

| 2:09:51| want to cry. Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| Americans will not wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| and just simply look out for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| We are too worried about politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| and being on one side or another or taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| a vaccine. It's our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| my kids, my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7805)|

| 2:10:11| It makes me want to cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| Kids and adults are dying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| and they're going to continue dying, and I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| to cry. When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| I go through my day, it is a fantasy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| It is a farce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| I know kids are getting sick. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| it's coming, and I try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| I'm told to keep it normal. I'm told to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| keep going. Last year was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| not normal. This year is even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| harder because we are even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| more limited and our hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| We cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| keep going like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| We are caught in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| for our kids and your kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| Knox County. We are caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| in the middle, and I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| to cry. There is nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| that I can do right now, not enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| hours in the day to pray or to write| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| or call. All I can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| is protect my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| my four walls that is my sanctuary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| to try and keep what is staring at us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| all boldly in the face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| and I have family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| that can be harmed severely, or even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| myself. I still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| want to cry, but parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7871)|

| 2:11:21| your children, no matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| what is said here tonight or what is decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7883)|

| 2:11:39| we have behaved as adults because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| children will listen, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| learn from us. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7903)|

| 2:12:19| On August 9th, I wrote a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| asking you all to please ensure that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7941)|

| 2:12:27| You failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| At that time, anyone who was paying attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| could have seen what was coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| and some of you chose to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| to political pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| and conspiracy theories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| rather than science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| You failed to protect our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| My son has autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| For him to get COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| would be much more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| He cannot communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7969)|
| 2:12:51| If his head hurts, he can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| say, my head hurts. Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| Last year, we kept him home all year long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| and we made a lot of sacrifices to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| We lost work days. We lost time with family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7983)|

| 2:13:07| work. It was worthless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| basically, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| thought it was worth it to keep him safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| keep our family safe, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7993)|

| 2:19:47| comparison. Despite the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| massive disruption from COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| we've decided that a simple safeguard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8391)|

| 2:19:57| rhetorical questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8397)|

| 2:20:09| And despite personal frustration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| the reason why they should do everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| in their care to treat these patients goes beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| their personal values and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8415)|

| 2:20:21| it has been supposedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| clear-cut that for decades, the personal choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8423)|

| 2:20:31| punished in schools to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| distracting learning environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8433)|

| 2:20:53| this disruption to our school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| goes beyond our personal attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| Since transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8457)|

| 2:21:17| that we need to humanize what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| To come to alarming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| portrayals in media, we've abandoned our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| to form relationships and stop trusting each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| other. I won't speculate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| why. People are infinitely complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| yet we let our personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| beliefs get in the way of making large decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8491)|

| 2:21:35| this is truly devastating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| When we take off our masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| we realize the complexities of choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| liberty, human dignity, and public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8501)|

| 2:21:45| And yet it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| so easy to say no to masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| It is just as easy to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| But the complexities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| of consequences beyond today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8513)|

| 2:22:43| I do want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=8563)|

| 2:39:05| You made it to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9545)|
| 2:39:09| So, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| downside of being the last one to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| is I've had 30 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| use my material ahead of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| So, of course, this is about as useful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9557)|
| 2:39:19| as some of those masks you guys are wearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9559)|
| 2:39:23| I don't have any kids in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9563)|

| 2:39:29| But he did guide my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| hand into opening a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| medical practice. Some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| recognize me. You've seen me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| before but don't know who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| I am Mr. Nurse Debbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| I am the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9581)|

| 2:39:45| So we opened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| a medical practice where we can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| take care of people. Not talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9589)|
| 2:39:51| Not pass mandates. Not make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| them wear a mask. But take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| care of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| We do that. We do it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| health. We do it with wellness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| It's in the name of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| These masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| you're forcing things on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| people. Why do we force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| anything on anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| We shouldn't be. We're Americans. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| here in Tennessee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| Why are we forcing things? I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| people bring up the argument about seatbelts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| Yeah, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| I know there's a law about seatbelts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| And as much as I love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| and respect Sheriff Spangler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| he does not ride with me on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| daily basis to make sure I wear one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| I do so by my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9635)|
| 2:40:37| I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| EMTs, first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| law enforcement agents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| tell me some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| gruesome deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| that were caused by people who were actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| wearing seatbelts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| Now, that doesn't happen to everybody that gets in an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| Usually a fender bender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| saves you from hitting your head on the steering wheel. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| But you know what? Even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| seatbelts can kill people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| So it's supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| a protective measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| Masks are supposed to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| protective measure. But they don't all work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| They don't work for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| They're not going to work for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9673)|

| 2:41:17| I can't wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| Just like the vaccination, I'm not taking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9679)|
| 2:41:21| I've got a factor 5 blood clotting factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| I'm not taking any vaccination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| If you come at me with a shot, I'm going to give you one of my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| there's anything else I could say that you haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| already heard. I'm sorry, you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| I'm not going to be crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| I'm not going to be yelling at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| I'm not going to be submitting you to anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| You guys have a great evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| Thank you. That concludes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9701)|

| 2:41:49| Mr. Superintendent for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9709)|

| 2:41:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9713)|
| 2:41:55| First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| I'd like to just take a moment to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| the significant efforts of our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| and all our staff who continue to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| hard for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| Today marks the 18th day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9725)|
| 2:42:07| of the school year and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9727)|
| 2:42:09| they've all been given their all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| actually to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| our students and try to make up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| lost ground caused by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9735)|

| 2:42:21| I'd like to acknowledge that nearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| 50,000 of our students are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| receiving important in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| And my report this evening is based in part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| on a request from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| board member Daniel Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| I'm sure we've captured everything that Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| wanted us to capture, but we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| tried to do our best given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| the time that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| Mr. Watson asked us to share some comparative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| student and staff attendance data that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| available from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| two years prior in this current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| We actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| sent this information to you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| I think we were working on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9777)|
| 2:42:59| non-stop today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| Just in looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9781)|
| 2:43:03| 2022 school year, 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| and then 19 and 20 school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| year. So if you look at the chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| certainly you can see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| the staff, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| our attendance is down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| our staff rate attendance is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| So if you looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| 19, 20, 96%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| 20 and 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| 96.2% and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| 21, 22, 93.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| Now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9807)|
| 2:43:29| represents one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9809)|

| 2:43:33| We're not quite through with 20-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| I think it ends Friday, this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| We can fill in that chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| as we go with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| 20-day attendance period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| Just looking at that just gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| you a snapshot on staff attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| and what that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9827)|
| 2:43:49| over the last three years and up to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| for where we are this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| There are several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| factors in looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| that information. Take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| into consideration. You'll see that those notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| that are in the section there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| includes counting last year's isolated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| quarantine teachers present when they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| provide virtual instruction from home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| or isolated quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| students who were counted present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| due to the availability of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| synchronous and asynchronous instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9855)|
| 2:44:19| Again, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| any questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9861)|

| 2:44:27| information. We've sent it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| Also some additional data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| with student attendance rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| for the first 17 days at the bottom of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| Again, it's 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| days, obviously not 20 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| and not counting today which is the 18th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| day. This shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| that our attendance rate is lower than the first two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| and as is typically the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| attendance at the start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| of school is high but over time you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| more absences and yesterday's attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| was slightly more than the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| before. So just to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| a snapshot look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9901)|
| 2:45:07| Along with the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| that Mr. Watson requested, we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| to provide you with some additional data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| and Mr. Watson didn't ask for this but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| thought it was pertinent. First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| is the student attendance rate for the first 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| instructional days shows that our attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| is lower than the first two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| Obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| at the start of school the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| attendance is usually higher but yesterday's attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| was up slightly more than the day before so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| we'll be looking at what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| today in comparison to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| the chart that you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9937)|
| 2:45:49| For staff attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| same period looks very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| with attendance down from the previous two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| but up slightly over the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9955)|
| 2:46:01| Then we looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| at one more chart just looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9963)|
| 2:46:05| absence numbers over the last five days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| in terms of percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| You'll see that absences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| directly related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| to active cases range from 6.2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| to 8.7%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| for students and 11.7%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| to 17% for staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| and you can also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| see the percentage of absences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| not related to active cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| which represents the majority of absences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9987)|
| 2:46:37| Okay and then staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| absence is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| similar with the majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| absences being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| COVID related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| I know Mr. Oaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| if the student attendants can speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| probably address the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10019)|
| 2:47:01| Mr. McPherson on staff attendance data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10021)|
| 2:47:03| so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10025)|
| 2:47:07| Thank you Superintendent. I really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| all the work that went into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| pulling together the charts and also the extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10031)|
| 2:47:13| information. I want to make sure that I heard one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| correctly. On the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| it's not up right now but on the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| sorry on the student data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| for last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| those who would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10043)|
| 2:47:25| virtual would be counted present in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10045)|
| 2:47:27| graph. Is that correct? Right. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10047)|
| 2:47:29| Okay. And that's also true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| then of the staff graph as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| that if they're teaching virtual then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| that would be represented as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| Yes sir. Okay. Thank you. One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| questions that I've gotten a lot and I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10059)|
| 2:47:41| the answer to it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| folks have asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| and I know there's a lot of factors that go into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| but in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| when we make a decision to close schools relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| to flu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| what attendance rate would that typically be at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| And again I know there's other factors but that's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10077)|
| 2:47:59| of the questions that I've been asked a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| Again it would typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| higher than what's reflected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| right here but again you know when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| close schools for flu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| we would use inclement weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| days, staff development days, things of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| that nature which certainly we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| could use inclement weather days now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| That's a possibility. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| 10 inclement weather days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| in terms of what the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| will allow and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| commissioner talked with us the other day about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| they will, there's a waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| process but she really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10111)|
| 2:48:33| indicated that that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| there would be no possible way you have school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| put in order to get one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| waivers so it really sounds like it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| be a difficult process. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| a few of the systems that have closed I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| have begun to use some of their inclement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10125)|

| 2:48:53| Mr. Bolton too, you can probably talk to it if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| more specific questions but our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| percentage of absences has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| generally been higher when we've closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| than what they show right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| Sorry I did not get a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| to look at it yet. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| received, I've received over 1200 emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10149)|
| 2:49:11| related to COVID so that one got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| buried but I'll dig into it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10153)|
| 2:49:15| here soon. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| Ms. Babb has been advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| for maybe a second email address so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| can keep our stuff straight but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| I appreciate the work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| So and when you, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10165)|
| 2:49:27| Commissioner Schwinn said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| you've got to have no possible way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| of having school in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| did she benchmark that? Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| data, she said, is there any data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| that she said you've got to hit for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| No, she did not benchmark that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| Okay. Alright, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10183)|
| 2:49:45| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| some of the absenteeism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| we're seeing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| I see it more as a positive sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10191)|
| 2:49:53| because we are telling people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| to not send their sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| kids to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| We are saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| be extra cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| You know, I've heard from parents this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| that have said, I never thought I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| keep my children home for a runny nose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10207)|
| 2:50:09| but here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| So I think some of that's a good sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| and I did have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| with Dr. Childs today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| at Children's and he kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| validated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| that a little bit in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| what they're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| in the pediatric practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| and the urgent cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| You know, the kids aren't sick enough to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| hospitalized but the parents just want to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| and come in and get those COVID tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| just to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| so they can safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| send their kids back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| So I don't necessarily see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10241)|
| 2:50:43| high absentee rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| as being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10245)|
| 2:50:47| a really, really bad thing. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| part of that is people are doing exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| what we have asked them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| Great point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10257)|
| 2:50:59| Any other questions for Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| Okay, thank you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| update. We appreciate that. It's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| Okay, and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| refer to Ms. Coatney for the reading of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10269)|

| 2:51:23| Is there a motion so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| we can discuss it? So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| Thank you, Ms. Christy. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10287)|

| 2:51:31| And now discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| Do we want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| maybe some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| explanation? Ms. Babb, would you like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| to have a question or maybe we can just ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| an explanation first? Really, I need an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10301)|
| 2:51:43| I am a little confused about this one and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10303)|
| 2:51:45| what it's trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| achieve and just, anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| hopefully your explanation will answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10309)|
| 2:51:51| all my questions. Okay, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10311)|
| 2:51:53| give it a shot again and then John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10313)|
| 2:51:55| can come in and help me if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10315)|
| 2:51:57| fail to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| adequately for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10319)|
| 2:52:01| Prior to this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| and looking at attendance, it would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| unexcused absence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| and it would be, then it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| students be able to make up their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| But if we can approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10331)|
| 2:52:13| this policy, then those absences for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10333)|
| 2:52:15| quarantines would be excused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| absences. I know a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| excuse me, not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| counted absence. So really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10341)|
| 2:52:23| this is a way to count kids present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10343)|
| 2:52:25| if they're quarantined, if they do their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10345)|
| 2:52:27| And otherwise, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| an absence. Some parents really want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| their child's attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| perfect if it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| and also with chronic absenteeism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| this would help us with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10359)|
| 2:52:43| I guess I am a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10363)|
| 2:52:45| concerned. I mean, would we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| totally lose numbers of how many kids are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| out of school with this? Because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10369)|
| 2:52:51| does seem like it's, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10371)|
| 2:52:53| don't know who can answer that, because I do think that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10373)|
| 2:52:55| I'm a little confused about this. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| as someone spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| doing a worksheet or something, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10379)|
| 2:53:01| the same as being in school? So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10381)|
| 2:53:03| if there could be a little bit more flesh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10383)|
| 2:53:05| out of this, because I still am a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10385)|
| 2:53:07| confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| Thank you, Ms. Cherub. Okay. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10389)|

| 2:53:43| from year to year is similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10423)|
| 2:53:45| I can't say that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| comparable, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| the way that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10429)|
| 2:53:51| have taken attendance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10431)|
| 2:53:53| measured attendance has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| in each of the last three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| years. So three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10437)|
| 2:53:59| ago, we were taking attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| rules and coding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| that had been in place for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| And then last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| with all of the various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10449)|
| 2:54:11| mitigation steps that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10451)|
| 2:54:13| had to take and the virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| instruction, how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| coded that had to change, because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| had to capture kids that were in virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| instruction. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10461)|
| 2:54:23| had to capture kids who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| were in virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| instruction simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10467)|
| 2:54:29| because they were quarantined, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10469)|
| 2:54:31| because maybe they were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10471)|
| 2:54:33| isolation because they were COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10473)|
| 2:54:35| positive. So we captured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| those in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| attendance data, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| were considered to be present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| if they were virtually doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10483)|
| 2:54:45| their work, either synchronously or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| asynchronously. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| that changed again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| this year, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10491)|
| 2:54:53| unless we adapt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| or adopt this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| kids who are out of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10497)|
| 2:54:59| and doing their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| a virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| synchronous or asynchronous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| manner are counted absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| And that's a big chunk of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| difference in the absence for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| first 17 or 18 days of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| that you see right now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| the first 17 or 18 days of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| that you saw last year. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| first off, we had 18,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10521)|
| 2:55:23| kids that were in 100% virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| instruction all year that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| were largely present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| Then we had kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10529)|
| 2:55:31| who would come in and out of virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| instruction, either synchronous or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| asynchronous, based on whether they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| COVID quarantined or whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| they were isolated. So we had all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| that going on. We were able to capture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| that, and we were able to count the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10543)|
| 2:55:45| ones present who were doing their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| and that were keeping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| That is not the case right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| So what this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| to the policy does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| or this piece of the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| within the policy does, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| allows us to capture that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| information similar to the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| that we did it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| we all know what we dealt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| with with COVID last year and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| COVID numbers that we had and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| the high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| number of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10577)|
| 2:56:19| that we had who were quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| who were not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| And that would have driven our numbers down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10583)|
| 2:56:25| But if you remember last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| our attendance numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| were steady right around 95%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| which is better than in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| normal year. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10593)|
| 2:56:35| that, I think, is the virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| effect that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| So that's why those numbers are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| I think if you could capture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| the absence numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| this year the same way we captured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| them last year, you're going to be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| similar numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| at that point. So we'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| much closer to doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| what we did last year as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| calculating the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| absences of concern. Does that make any sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| It does. I guess what concerns me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| and honestly, I guess it concerns me even about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| how we tracked stuff last year, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| we're really saying we had 95%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| of kids not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| absent. That doesn't mean we had 95%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| of kids in school, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10633)|
| 2:57:15| We had 95% of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10635)|
| 2:57:17| getting instruction in some form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| or another. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| where I'm going with this is a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| of, we look at our TCAP scores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| last year, and I mean this is, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| somebody that is just going to be driven by that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| we look at the fact of, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10649)|
| 2:57:31| look at kids that really got instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| in the classroom versus the kids that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| if we're not keeping up with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| somewhat, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| do we sort of know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| how many kids really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| got in-person instruction and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| did not get in-person instruction? And this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10667)|
| 2:57:49| we're really not offering virtual the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| we did last year. So, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| say this got really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| Say 50% of our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| weren't showing up for school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| but they all did a worksheet at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| Are we now saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| we've got 95% of the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| kids getting instruction one day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| It depends on what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| with that worksheet and how they turn it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| and if it is, it is, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| let, Dr. Ryswick is much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| talk about the classroom mechanics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| of it than I am, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| And are we going to, I guess are we also going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| show at all that we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| how many kids are out of school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| or if we pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| there will be no sense of knowing how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| kids are in school. Oh, we know exactly, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| know exactly how many kids are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| receiving instruction virtually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10715)|
| 2:58:37| because they will be coded for virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| instruction. Right now, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| can't be coded for virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| instruction because they're doing makeup work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| They're absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10725)|
| 2:58:47| So, that's part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10727)|
| 2:58:49| of our challenge right now. We need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| know who's receiving virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| instruction and to be able to code it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| We also need to know it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| for purposes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| our food service program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| because we have to report that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| state every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| help them calculate our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| reimbursement rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| And maybe this leads, I don't know if this goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| right with this question, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| from the state, they have changed back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| and forth and I mean, I don't know how we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10757)|
| 2:59:19| keeping up with it because it seems like on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| what we're allowed to do and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| we're not allowed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| So, to me, that somewhat goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| along with this virtual instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| and what we're doing. I mean, can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| someone speak to what we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| planning on doing for kids that are going to be at home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| Who's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| It's your turn. You're up now, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| And I mean, this might be on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| else, but I think it really ties into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10781)|
| 2:59:43| and I think it's what a lot of people are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| is what are we really allowed to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| for the kids that are not coming to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| Thank you, Ms. Babbitt. And let me say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| and I think Russ did a good job of explaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| the attendance part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| So, really, what you're getting at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| is what the state board policy that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10797)|
| 2:59:59| passed in July was trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10799)|
| 3:00:01| to get at. So, last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| there was kind of this whole harmless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| type of thing where we could code any student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10805)|
| 3:00:07| who was isolated, quarantined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| or on virtual instruction or a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| that went to virtual instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| They all had a certain code. Freddie's great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| on the code. It was a BL code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| So, you knew a kid was virtually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| getting instruction as opposed to an in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| student. The state knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| it was kind of loose around that about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| in the middle of COVID how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10825)|
| 3:00:27| to do that. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| they knew the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| attendance numbers weren't super accurate across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| state, right? So, this year, to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| tighten that up, that was the action that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10835)|
| 3:00:37| state board took in July. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| a lot of people think that's when they defined virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| programs and virtual schools. That was done, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| years ago. All they did was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| brought that same policy up and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| added this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| attendance piece for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| students who were quarantined or isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| They leave the word isolated out, but that's what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10853)|
| 3:00:55| meant. Quarantined or isolated so that there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| way to track their attendance. That's what this whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| is. So, in order for us to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10859)|
| 3:01:01| move to put students who are quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| or isolated into temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| virtual instruction, we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| have a policy change in the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| according to the state board that allows it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10869)|
| 3:01:11| for that reason. So, this language is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| lifted straight out of the state board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| and it really is to say they lay out four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| different ways and you have to meet two of those four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| to track attendance. That's the state's way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| to get back to a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10881)|
| 3:01:23| accurate way of tracking students' attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| so it's not just a free for all. All of these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| are VL coded and they're all getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| instruction. There are some requirements and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| laid out in those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| either teachers have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| contact visual or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| phone contact every day with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| Synchronous instruction, which would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| extremely expensive for us to do. We'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| hire a bunch of teachers to go do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| and then there's three and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| four, the ones that we're looking to do. One is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| students complete work, we're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| via Canvas, which is a learning management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| Canvas isn't laid out in the state board, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10913)|
| 3:01:55| learning management system is. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| four says that students have to be able to submit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10917)|
| 3:01:59| work on a daily basis through their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| learning management system or in person. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| for us, we're meeting three and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| four by our plan. Getting to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| Ms. Vibe. So, we have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| from the beginning, and let me try to be clear about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| in the summer before COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| made its resurgence, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| expectation was something Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| had asked earlier. What did we learn at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| end of last year that we want to carry on practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| wise? Well, one thing we learned is that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10941)|
| 3:02:23| teachers were trained in Canvas. We were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10943)|
| 3:02:25| to shut down for a week to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10945)|
| 3:02:27| fully virtual and all of our teachers used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| Microsoft Teams and all of our teachers used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10949)|
| 3:02:31| Canvas. We were trained in that. We continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10951)|
| 3:02:33| to offer training. We continue to do it now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| did it all summer. It's an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| now of us that Canvas was not a COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10957)|
| 3:02:39| response. Virtual and Chromebooks that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| all spent millions of dollars was not a COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10961)|
| 3:02:43| response. It's actually an instructional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10963)|
| 3:02:45| tool that we have moving forward. So, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| started through the summer expressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| through the principal institute from the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10969)|
| 3:02:51| that our expectation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10971)|

| 3:03:01| That's a muscle we learned to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10981)|
| 3:03:03| and we don't want to stop using it or we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10983)|
| 3:03:05| going to have to go into this massive retrain again, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| to retrain everybody to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10987)|
| 3:03:09| That continued. COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| obviously is making somewhat of a resurgence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| and so we've continued to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| that asynchronous posting of those lessons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10995)|
| 3:03:17| right, continued support from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| school level and or our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=10999)|
| 3:03:21| of technology to help support and train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| teachers who need that at the school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| to be able to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| I think teachers have a knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11007)|
| 3:03:29| base of Canvas. I'm not saying everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| is a master of that, but we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| it enough last year we were able to go virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11013)|
| 3:03:35| schools using that as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11015)|
| 3:03:37| close the week before Christmas and use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| So our plan will be no different than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| we were saying before and my hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11021)|
| 3:03:43| is, you know, we see this COVID resurgence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| leave and we still have this expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11025)|
| 3:03:47| that you post your makeup work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11027)|
| 3:03:49| Canvas. Sometimes that's a PowerPoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11029)|
| 3:03:51| with a worksheet. Sometimes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11031)|
| 3:03:53| could be a video. We're not asking teachers to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| 10 more things than they're already doing. We're asking them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| to move it into electronic format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| My time in schools last year, I know our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| out in schools last year, most of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11041)|
| 3:04:03| in-person classrooms were using Canvas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11043)|
| 3:04:05| for submission of work and all those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11045)|
| 3:04:07| too so they weren't making all their copies. I'm not saying everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11047)|
| 3:04:09| is doing that across the board. So our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11049)|
| 3:04:11| plan is for all students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11051)|
| 3:04:13| that their asynchronous assignments are posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11053)|
| 3:04:15| if you need support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11055)|
| 3:04:17| Danny and Julie both have different plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| working with the elementary PAC or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| principal advisory council and the secondary advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11061)|
| 3:04:23| council. They may do it a little bit differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| but right now our plan as we're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| through that is that we'll potentially provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11067)|
| 3:04:29| dollars to each school for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| to be able to pay teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| in a tutoring format where they can either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11073)|
| 3:04:35| during the day or have office hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11075)|
| 3:04:37| after school to be able to support the students who are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11077)|
| 3:04:39| that mode. That's actually a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| of the state board policy that you have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| one, the work available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| and that there has to be some support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| in there for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11087)|
| 3:04:49| Our best way to do that now, not to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| teachers teaching on two platforms and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11091)|
| 3:04:53| having a hybrid class where you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11093)|
| 3:04:55| 15 kids in session and 5 logging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11095)|
| 3:04:57| in from the outside is to try to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| it's true to what we ask teachers to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11099)|
| 3:05:01| teach your class in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11101)|
| 3:05:03| put your makeup work and your assignments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11103)|
| 3:05:05| on canvas asynchronously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| and then we will be providing dollars in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| to each of those grade levels based on principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11109)|
| 3:05:11| input of how they want to provide support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| for those teachers and families in off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| hours or during the day if that's what they decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11115)|
| 3:05:19| Thank you Dr. Isaac. I think Ms. Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| has a question. I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| I'm not sure who would be best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| to answer this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| Looking at it from a data perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| would it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| be accurate to say that using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| this policy change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| we would be able to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| attendance to consider whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| student received instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| but not necessarily to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| determine district wide illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11143)|
| 3:05:47| I think to your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| about instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11149)|
| 3:05:51| we talked a lot about that too because there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11151)|
| 3:05:53| this kind of daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11153)|
| 3:05:55| because it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11155)|
| 3:05:57| students must submit work via hard copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11157)|
| 3:05:59| or virtual formats. We talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11159)|
| 3:06:01| some of that. Our thought on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11161)|
| 3:06:03| is asynchronously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11163)|
| 3:06:05| a student could be sick and not able to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| in two or three days. Probably not going to hold that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11167)|
| 3:06:09| against them. If he or she is submitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| sometime during that ten day period and doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11171)|
| 3:06:13| that I think our thought would be show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11173)|
| 3:06:15| some grace and let the principal and teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| say the student is trying in best interest to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11177)|
| 3:06:19| so I think as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| instruction and attendance based on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| I think we would again allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11183)|
| 3:06:25| the schools to make that call but allow them to count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| the student present if in good faith they were working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11187)|
| 3:06:29| toward that even if they weren't able to every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11189)|
| 3:06:31| I think I'm getting more toward the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11191)|
| 3:06:33| way around. If the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| is sick but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| able to do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| we have no way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| know that really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11201)|
| 3:06:43| Well if they were submitting the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11203)|
| 3:06:45| we would be able to again count them from that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11205)|
| 3:06:47| If the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| and I may not be understanding your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11209)|
| 3:06:51| if the question is could we tell that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11211)|
| 3:06:53| that kid was doing that virtually versus in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| we could off of coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11215)|
| 3:06:57| I may be missing your question. What I'm looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| is when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11219)|
| 3:07:01| we're thinking about attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11221)|
| 3:07:03| as a way of determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| how much illness there could be in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11225)|
| 3:07:07| district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| that this may not allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| to do that. Are you saying this could mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11231)|
| 3:07:13| an ill student who would be at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| by showing their presence? Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11235)|
| 3:07:17| Yeah, I'm going to go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| attendance on coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| I was just talking to Freddie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| about that. I think the way the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| is written is we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11245)|
| 3:07:27| coding you and I'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11247)|
| 3:07:29| use the term VL because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11249)|
| 3:07:31| that was the code that we used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11251)|
| 3:07:33| last year. We'll probably continue to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11253)|
| 3:07:35| If you're coded VL based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| this policy it means you're receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| some type of virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| instruction because you're quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11261)|
| 3:07:43| or you're isolated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| and that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11265)|
| 3:07:47| an indicator that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| had a COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11269)|
| 3:07:51| illness. So it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11271)|
| 3:07:53| capture both of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11275)|
| 3:07:57| Is it going to be absolutely perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11277)|
| 3:07:59| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11279)|
| 3:08:01| But it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11281)|
| 3:08:03| step in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11283)|
| 3:08:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| Thank you, Ms. Owen. Okay, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11287)|
| 3:08:09| Mr. Watson and then we'll go to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11289)|
| 3:08:11| Henderson. I think Ms. Henderson was actually first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11291)|
| 3:08:13| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| So, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| sorry you had to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11297)|
| 3:08:19| This is something I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| actually really passionate about talking about because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11301)|
| 3:08:23| these kids getting behind and everything is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11303)|
| 3:08:25| something that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| last year and I think that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| come up with things in place to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| alleviate that a little bit this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11311)|
| 3:08:33| So what happens if a student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| let's say a student is out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11315)|
| 3:08:37| quarantine and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| they have a test after the week they get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| and they've missed two weeks already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| I mean, I just think that it's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| opportunity to beef up our virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11325)|
| 3:08:47| options. We saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11327)|
| 3:08:49| what worked last year, what didn't work last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| year and we can constantly be working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11331)|
| 3:08:53| on that, changing it, making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11333)|
| 3:08:55| better. And I've talked to several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| teachers who really need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| time to get their virtual instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11339)|
| 3:09:01| kind of up and ready. Have you guys thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11341)|
| 3:09:03| maybe taking a couple days off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11343)|
| 3:09:05| giving everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11345)|
| 3:09:07| a reset and letting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11347)|
| 3:09:09| teachers get that up and running a little bit better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| Good question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| Ms. Henderson. I think two parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| on that where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| number one, I'm sure that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11357)|
| 3:09:19| will be teachers again who need to be thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11359)|
| 3:09:21| through that. We're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| to continue to grow to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| think about it not being as two separate things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| like how I teach in person and what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| have to do to convert over to digital because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11369)|
| 3:09:31| we've tried to avoid that hybrid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11371)|
| 3:09:33| teaching, right? Instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11373)|
| 3:09:35| trying to talk about how do we bring the virtual into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| the classroom as a tool so that you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11377)|
| 3:09:39| some assignments and doing those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| With that still, we know one year doesn't make us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| masters in it so we still need to improve on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11383)|
| 3:09:45| We are a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| limited in the second option about having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11387)|
| 3:09:49| that virtual. I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11389)|
| 3:09:51| last year there was flexibility in districts to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11391)|
| 3:09:53| say, hey, let's practice virtual for a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11393)|
| 3:09:55| or do those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11395)|
| 3:09:57| We don't really have that flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11397)|
| 3:09:59| now. I mean, I know superintendents explain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11399)|
| 3:10:01| waiver process and or snow days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| or inclement weather days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| So I think it would be a little harder to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| do that. I mean, we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| burn a day or burn two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| You're kind of gambling there's not going to be snow or you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11411)|
| 3:10:13| going to need those kinds of things later in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11413)|
| 3:10:15| the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| So we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| have the flexibility to say tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11419)|
| 3:10:21| the next two days are virtual days to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| on that because those would count as against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| our ten days for inclement weather days. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11425)|
| 3:10:27| think that might be a little harder to work in. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11427)|
| 3:10:29| impossible, but I mean there would be a cost to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11429)|
| 3:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11431)|
| 3:10:33| And can I just ask a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| real quick as a follow up to that? I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11435)|
| 3:10:37| one of the issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| I've heard from teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| and principals is that they're concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| about what the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11443)|
| 3:10:45| is because they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11445)|
| 3:10:47| you know, they are trying to teach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| their class in person and so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11449)|
| 3:10:51| think that there's a lot of concern around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11451)|
| 3:10:53| that. You know, what is exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| what is expected to be on the website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11455)|
| 3:10:57| Are they supposed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| or what's available to students? Are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11459)|
| 3:11:01| supposed to have videos for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11461)|
| 3:11:03| kids to watch and that kind of thing? So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| I think that, is that kind of what you're hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| as a concern? I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| the big concern is that teachers and principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11469)|
| 3:11:11| principals understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| teachers are stressed about that and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| that's I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11475)|
| 3:11:17| the big question for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11477)|
| 3:11:19| I would just say this. I mean we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| I think it's been expressed over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| and over. Virtual has a place and I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11483)|
| 3:11:25| the virtual schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11485)|
| 3:11:27| academies that the students have enrolled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11487)|
| 3:11:29| in. I mean those teachers are fully working on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11489)|
| 3:11:31| full time with caseloads. That's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11491)|
| 3:11:33| a little bit of a different virtual experience. Obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11493)|
| 3:11:35| it's synchronous and those things are happening in real time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11495)|
| 3:11:37| than it's going to be for a student who's on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| 10 day quarantine with a teacher who's teaching in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| Last year what we saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| Shannon did a great job and her team looking through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| that. What we saw was teachers would kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11505)|
| 3:11:47| overdo, if you will, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11507)|
| 3:11:49| they really were, you know, they're so used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| teaching with their students in person where they can go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| touch them and be kind of, you know, over their shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11513)|
| 3:11:55| and look at those things that they tended to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| kind of like create these mega assignments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| that were bigger and bigger and bigger trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| make sure they could have kind of the same experience there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| I don't know that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| be able to replicate that. I mean our expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| is not to create more things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| or record a video during your planned time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| everyone in your classes that puts that over. Our expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| is, you know, if these were my slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11533)|
| 3:12:15| for a PowerPoint presentation or this was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11535)|
| 3:12:17| worksheet, I'm pulling those over into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11537)|
| 3:12:19| Canvas. There's even some, Shannon and her team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| have worked with folks to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| some Canvas Commons, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| classes and some lessons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11545)|
| 3:12:27| like apply for all first grade or all second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| grade. There are some schools that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| will be looking and thinking about that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11551)|
| 3:12:33| You know, if we have seven English 1 teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11553)|
| 3:12:35| maybe we can create kind of a series of lessons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| and we can share those around. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| I'd say, you know, again, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11559)|
| 3:12:41| we learned a lot, it's probably not totally perfected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| in how we do that, but I think there's opportunities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| grow. But, I mean, I would say that for the record, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| expectation is not for teachers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| do dual on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| that at all. Okay, great. That's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| Thank you. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| you all clarifying the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11577)|
| 3:12:59| around coding. A quick follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| up. Well, let me, since you're up there, John, let me get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| some questions for you real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11583)|
| 3:13:07| So, the support for students available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| on asynchronous instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11589)|
| 3:13:11| you know, I think we have to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11591)|
| 3:13:13| that submitting assignments is different than instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| right? It's a very different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11595)|
| 3:13:17| And so, students who are quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11597)|
| 3:13:19| or isolated who might be submitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11599)|
| 3:13:21| assignments asynchronously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| what type of support are we able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| provide? I know we're not going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| a teacher live the whole time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11607)|
| 3:13:29| virtual instruction, but what's the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11609)|
| 3:13:31| options that are on the table? What are we considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| to provide for students during support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| during that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11615)|
| 3:13:37| We started talking to our principal advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| councils for that, and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| the secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| principal advisory, because they're kind of two different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| what those principals have asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11627)|
| 3:13:49| are some funds to be able to either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11629)|
| 3:13:51| pay their teachers to teach on their plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11631)|
| 3:13:53| or be available. Some have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| like a hotline to be able to do that, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| it may be the core subject areas where you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| we kind of have math help, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11639)|
| 3:14:01| and you can call in if you need those supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11641)|
| 3:14:03| or that sort of thing. It may be after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11643)|
| 3:14:05| school hours or tutoring that's offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| at that point that they can, when parents come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11647)|
| 3:14:09| home, that they might be able to call and have somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11649)|
| 3:14:11| So, the idea of having somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| live in real time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| specifically for that is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11655)|
| 3:14:17| very difficult without hiring a bunch of extra staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| So, I think it's more availability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| for extra, like, specific supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11661)|
| 3:14:23| And that's not to say that the base teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11663)|
| 3:14:25| you know, they're not, you know, waiving all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| responsibility. They can still answer emails and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| We're just really trying not to overload the current teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| in there, you know, as they teach in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| So, it sounds like there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11673)|
| 3:14:35| going to be opportunity for each school to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11675)|
| 3:14:37| creative about how to provide that support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11677)|
| 3:14:39| and do it as they need in their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| How can we, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| I love creativity, how can we ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| that each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| student has an opportunity for support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11687)|
| 3:14:49| when we're doing it that way, school by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11689)|
| 3:14:51| school, and a lot of creativity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| That's a good question. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| there will be the expectation that that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| I do think, we did have a conversation with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| principal about this, you know, there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| level that you want to be creative, but you also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11701)|
| 3:15:03| want to have some level of district consistency. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11703)|
| 3:15:05| we were saying, you know, you don't want a student who goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11705)|
| 3:15:07| to West to say, oh, we're opening this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| and we're doing Teams calls and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11709)|
| 3:15:11| coming in live, but then you have a kid, same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| family at Bearden Middle who's saying, my teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11713)|
| 3:15:15| aren't doing that, I'm not getting the support I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11715)|
| 3:15:17| We really want to try to stick to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11717)|
| 3:15:19| the asynchronous so the teachers don't feel compelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11719)|
| 3:15:21| to have to do what some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| chose to do last year and be hybrid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11723)|
| 3:15:25| and juggling all those people at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11725)|
| 3:15:27| We think it's probably going to be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11727)|
| 3:15:29| and again, they'll help us with the models, but more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11729)|
| 3:15:31| kind of support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| as needed and it may not, again, be your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| teacher of record and sometimes it may be. It just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| depends on how the schools build that out for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| support. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11741)|
| 3:15:43| when will they, so this last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11743)|
| 3:15:45| item, number five, or number four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| says students submit work via hardcopy or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| virtual formats. How much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| is a student going to be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11751)|
| 3:15:53| to do that? You might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| have said earlier, I think you said something about ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| Is it within that ten day window?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11757)|
| 3:15:59| Just assuming that typically, you know, an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11759)|
| 3:16:01| isolation or a quarantine would be a ten day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| window, then, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11763)|
| 3:16:05| know, we do have make up policies. I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| there'll be some grace within that around kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11767)|
| 3:16:09| three day from return to school. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| idea would be in the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| the state board wrote the policy was that there's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| a daily submission of work if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| healthy and able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| But again, some of that's going to take some grace on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11779)|
| 3:16:21| kind of the family situation and the student situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| If a student were to be positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| and asymptomatic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11785)|
| 3:16:27| processing through, they probably could submit those on a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| basis. One of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| I've heard from administrators with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11791)|
| 3:16:33| policy is teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11793)|
| 3:16:35| having to go back retroactively and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| mark a kid present because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| let's say they were quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11799)|
| 3:16:41| and they chose to turn all of their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11801)|
| 3:16:43| in toward the end of that period instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| each day. And so now the teacher's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11805)|
| 3:16:47| like, oh, man, they were present. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| did everything that was expected. Now they've got to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| and mark them. How will that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| It's exactly opposite to default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11813)|
| 3:16:55| I like rest days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11815)|
| 3:16:59| It's exactly the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| The way we work attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11821)|
| 3:17:03| every day of the world is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11823)|
| 3:17:05| everybody is defaulted to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11825)|
| 3:17:07| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11827)|
| 3:17:09| you go in and change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11829)|
| 3:17:11| those who are not present to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11831)|
| 3:17:13| absent. That way you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11833)|
| 3:17:15| have to touch everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11835)|
| 3:17:17| in the district. You only touch those that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11837)|
| 3:17:19| absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11839)|
| 3:17:21| To clarify a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| on our virtual coding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11843)|
| 3:17:27| it is virtual instruction, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| can be absent from virtual instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| so that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11851)|
| 3:17:33| virtual present or virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| absent. And it works the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| way. So if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11857)|
| 3:17:39| out for ten days and I'm coded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| virtual during that ten days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11861)|
| 3:17:43| and I don't turn in any of my work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11863)|
| 3:17:45| or I don't do any of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11865)|
| 3:17:47| then you have to go back and code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11867)|
| 3:17:49| them absent as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11869)|
| 3:17:51| to going back. You've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11871)|
| 3:17:53| counted them absent. Now you're going to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11873)|
| 3:17:55| and count them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11875)|
| 3:17:57| present. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11877)|
| 3:17:59| the same process. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| not as iterative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| It takes a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| It takes a little bit longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11885)|
| 3:18:07| over a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11887)|
| 3:18:09| Okay. And to add to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| Owen's point, I want to make sure I'm clear on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| So the current COVID dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11893)|
| 3:18:15| that we have shows absences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| related to active cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| This attendance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| would not hamper our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| to be representative in that with the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11903)|
| 3:18:25| I just want to be clear that the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11905)|
| 3:18:27| we're coding gets present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11907)|
| 3:18:29| even if they're present but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11909)|
| 3:18:31| that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| an illness status. That's not whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11913)|
| 3:18:35| they're present or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11915)|
| 3:18:37| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11917)|
| 3:18:39| I think there's a lot of concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| that in terms of will that still be accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| I just want to make sure it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| Freddy, correct me. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11925)|
| 3:18:47| we're giving up anything in our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11927)|
| 3:18:49| to track any of that. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| actually adding to our ability to track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11933)|
| 3:18:55| That's correct. It actually gives us a little better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| clarity about the status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| of the students. So it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| virtual learning and present to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11941)|
| 3:19:03| as present. So it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11943)|
| 3:19:05| one code to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11945)|
| 3:19:07| We would be able to give a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| view of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11949)|
| 3:19:11| even though to the state it may say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11951)|
| 3:19:13| present or absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| Thank you. And just two more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11955)|
| 3:19:17| It says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11957)|
| 3:19:19| for isolation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11959)|
| 3:19:21| or quarantine due to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11961)|
| 3:19:23| is there a way to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| that people aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| taking advantage of this who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| are just not present for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| whatever reason but they're not really isolated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| How do we confirm that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| you're actually on isolation or being quarantined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11975)|
| 3:19:39| I think if somebody wants to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11979)|
| 3:19:41| advantage of anything, they can figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11981)|
| 3:19:43| out a way to take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| So I think we just have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11985)|
| 3:19:47| work it to the best of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| ability. And a minute ago when I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11989)|
| 3:19:51| is it absolutely perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11991)|
| 3:19:53| and that it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| that's one of the challenges that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11995)|
| 3:19:57| we face with it. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11997)|
| 3:19:59| it will be more accurate than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| And the last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12001)|
| 3:20:03| So of the four things, I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| make sure I'm reading this right, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| have to do at least two of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12007)|
| 3:20:09| to be counted present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12009)|
| 3:20:11| Correct. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12011)|
| 3:20:13| Can I ask a follow-up question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12013)|
| 3:20:15| to that, Russ? This may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12015)|
| 3:20:17| be for Dr. Reiser. I'm not sure who it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| So really to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12019)|
| 3:20:21| Watson's point, if they're treating this as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| a vacation and they don't check in with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12023)|
| 3:20:25| their teachers and they don't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12025)|
| 3:20:27| any of those things, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12027)|
| 3:20:29| they come back to school and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| then they're wanting to take the test they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| missed and they're wanting to be counted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| as present, but meanwhile they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12035)|
| 3:20:37| have to be actively engaged, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12037)|
| 3:20:39| on a daily basis is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12039)|
| 3:20:41| Right? And so I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12041)|
| 3:20:43| my question then is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12043)|
| 3:20:45| to Mr. Watson's point, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12045)|
| 3:20:47| they're treating it as a vacation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12047)|
| 3:20:49| and then they're wanting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12049)|
| 3:20:51| teachers to catch them up, that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12051)|
| 3:20:53| create a lot of extra work for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| they wouldn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| wouldn't be having to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12059)|
| 3:21:01| So I think that could be a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12061)|
| 3:21:03| to his point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12063)|
| 3:21:05| Thank you, Ms. Horne. I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12065)|
| 3:21:07| the isolation is probably going to be a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12067)|
| 3:21:09| clearer. I mean, that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| diagnosis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| in a way that there could be documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| for that and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| confirmation through the health department on that. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12077)|
| 3:21:19| is easier. To Mr. Oak's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| it's a little tougher on the quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| We know the way things are so that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| difficult. But there is a requirement even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| in the state board's policy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| they have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12089)|
| 3:21:31| submitting that work. So you couldn't go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12091)|
| 3:21:33| dark for 10 days and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| then come back and say I want credit for all those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| There has to be some work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12097)|
| 3:21:39| communication with the teacher and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12099)|
| 3:21:41| those kinds of things taking place in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12103)|
| 3:21:45| one of the requirements of that state board policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| is that there are six and a half hours of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| work that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| for that student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12111)|
| 3:21:53| every day to be doing. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12113)|
| 3:21:55| if they haven't done any of that over those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12115)|
| 3:21:57| 10 day periods, I think they would just be absent at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12117)|
| 3:21:59| point, especially if there was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12119)|
| 3:22:01| documentation of them being in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12121)|
| 3:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12123)|
| 3:22:05| And if they're truly sick, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12125)|
| 3:22:07| when they come back to school, then they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| would just be given their work as normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12129)|
| 3:22:11| as they would with any absence now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| Right. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12133)|
| 3:22:15| in most of these cases, sometimes before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| 10 day period, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12137)|
| 3:22:19| something. There would be communication with the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| It's not 100% foolproof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12141)|
| 3:22:23| If you just went dark for 10 days and then came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12143)|
| 3:22:25| back and didn't have any documentation, there would probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| a conversation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| Typically, again, we're going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| walk that out as it goes, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| those things could happen. As Mr. Oak said, there could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| be some folks who took advantage of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| and will try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12157)|
| 3:22:39| We would probably never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| as Mr. Myers just said, we wouldn't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| Definitely. We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| want to jeopardize their academic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| career. We want to make sure they've got every chance to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12167)|
| 3:22:49| to do those things and it's not punitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12169)|
| 3:22:51| But we also need to make sure they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| following some kind of guidelines for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12175)|
| 3:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| I would like to speak, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12179)|
| 3:23:01| Yes, please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12181)|
| 3:23:03| So a lot of the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12183)|
| 3:23:05| the question I had kind of came up, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12185)|
| 3:23:07| I don't really have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12187)|
| 3:23:09| question. I have a statement maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12189)|
| 3:23:11| I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12191)|
| 3:23:13| that this policy is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| attendance only, but there's not really a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12195)|
| 3:23:17| clear understanding from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12197)|
| 3:23:19| the district level on the grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12199)|
| 3:23:21| aspect of it. And I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12201)|
| 3:23:23| what Board Member Horan said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12203)|
| 3:23:25| putting the work on the teacher for when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12205)|
| 3:23:27| they come back. I just don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| us to have a mindset of punishing the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12209)|
| 3:23:31| regardless if they're sick or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12211)|
| 3:23:33| If they don't have the means or the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| to do the work every single day to upload| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12215)|
| 3:23:37| it, that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12217)|
| 3:23:39| And if they're quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12219)|
| 3:23:41| and at home and they can't come back until 10 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| but they don't have the support at home to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12223)|
| 3:23:45| the work every single day, then that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12225)|
| 3:23:47| they come back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12227)|
| 3:23:49| I know you talked about a grace period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12229)|
| 3:23:51| to get the work. So I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12231)|
| 3:23:53| when we finally vote on this for the next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| a district level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12235)|
| 3:23:57| consensus of that grace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12237)|
| 3:23:59| period across the board for the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| district of how much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12241)|
| 3:24:03| they will actually get to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| the work afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12245)|
| 3:24:07| And I think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12247)|
| 3:24:09| have to, as a district, think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| about when will the teachers have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| to upload this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| And so really, before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12255)|
| 3:24:17| vote, because I understand where it's coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| I understand this policy, but I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| a district level accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12261)|
| 3:24:23| and a district level plan on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12263)|
| 3:24:25| when the teachers will have the opportunity to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| what needs to be on the platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12267)|
| 3:24:29| as well as that district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| level grace period when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| comes to submitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12273)|
| 3:24:35| the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12275)|
| 3:24:37| Okay. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12277)|
| 3:24:39| Ms. Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| this is a called meeting, so the intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| is to vote on these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| Oh, then y'all better come up with some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| Because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12287)|
| 3:24:49| the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12289)|
| 3:24:51| And I know, Ms. Will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12291)|
| 3:24:53| was your question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12293)|
| 3:24:55| I just want to piggyback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| on Ms. Satterfield that I do think that the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| need time to build this out, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| That was going to be my next comment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12301)|
| 3:25:03| I'm very concerned that teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| are, that this is going to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| additional pressure, and I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| I heard you say that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| expectation from summer was to continue in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12311)|
| 3:25:13| but a lot of teachers weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12313)|
| 3:25:15| teaching in the summer, so it is kind of new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12315)|
| 3:25:17| And so I'm concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| that it's going to be a heavy lift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12319)|
| 3:25:21| for teachers, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12321)|
| 3:25:23| you know, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12323)|
| 3:25:25| if we're voting on this right now, tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12325)|
| 3:25:27| you know, students are going to have expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12327)|
| 3:25:29| that teachers may not be able to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12329)|
| 3:25:31| So, I think we need to be realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12333)|
| 3:25:35| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| Ms. Satterfield, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12337)|
| 3:25:39| then have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12339)|
| 3:25:41| is there another, something you needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12341)|
| 3:25:43| an answer to on, regarding that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12343)|
| 3:25:45| That and the grace period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12345)|
| 3:25:47| And I understand you said like the three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| that's what it is, that's what it is, but I want it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| like consensus across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| I'm happy to try to address some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| Okay, go ahead. So, I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| first of all, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| I hate to say, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| get it, there's that whole tight loose, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| How do we lay down exactly what needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12365)|
| 3:26:07| to happen, but then there's going to be 16 exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12367)|
| 3:26:09| to that. And that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| to leave that at the school and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| the teacher, to be able to have some ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12373)|
| 3:26:15| to do that, because every situation is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| a little bit different. We currently do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| the three days, you know, to make up work when you return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| Most schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12381)|
| 3:26:23| will give extended grace beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| I mean, yeah, there may be a teacher or two out there that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| going, nope, you know, kind of letter of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12387)|
| 3:26:29| here's what happens. But the whole idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12389)|
| 3:26:31| in this is that students aren't causing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12391)|
| 3:26:33| this to happen. It's something that they have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12393)|
| 3:26:35| to them. And that almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12395)|
| 3:26:37| all of the schools, all the schools that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| have been in understand that for graduation rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| for all those kinds of things that they're working to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| the students make up and catch up those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| things. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| I would say if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| situation where that's not been fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| you know, they should call their grade level director, they should talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| to their principal, talk to their teacher, like go through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| process to have that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| That's what would happen now, take COVID out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| situation, right? And if a kid needed more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| than three days, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| usually talk to the teacher and 99% of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12423)|
| 3:27:05| the teacher's fine with that. If there's a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| that the teacher's not, they talk to their principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| and they work their way up to where we get to Danny or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| Julie to have that conversation and let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12431)|
| 3:27:13| So, to me, it's not that much different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| than that. And if we lay, you know, four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| days out instead of three days and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| somebody's going to need five, you know, so I'm saying there's some of those kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12439)|
| 3:27:21| of things that we go, you know, we kind of trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| the school level administration and teachers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12443)|
| 3:27:25| do that. For the letter of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| for what we have to do for the state board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12447)|
| 3:27:29| this gives us that flexibility that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12449)|
| 3:27:31| board's acted so that we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12451)|
| 3:27:35| To me, that's where it's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12455)|
| 3:27:37| better across all the schools that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12457)|
| 3:27:39| let them try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| To address where we are with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| like virtual lessons, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| would say, again, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| want teachers to feel like they need to stop, drop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12469)|
| 3:27:51| load, you know, ten makeup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| assignments in there because the truth of the matter is that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12473)|
| 3:27:55| not going to solve it. When you've got kids who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12475)|
| 3:27:57| going to be out at different times during the year and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12477)|
| 3:27:59| may be on different units of study, like, you'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12479)|
| 3:28:01| load your whole year up on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12481)|
| 3:28:03| So, the idea is not a makeup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12483)|
| 3:28:05| assignment. The idea is a continuation of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12485)|
| 3:28:07| you're doing. So, if I'm teaching this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12487)|
| 3:28:09| novel or I'm teaching this math concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12489)|
| 3:28:11| what I'm doing, I'm loading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12491)|
| 3:28:13| into Canvas, like, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12493)|
| 3:28:15| it's not, I mean, I'm not going to say, oh, it's no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12495)|
| 3:28:17| They can just come and say, there's some effort in that for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| and there's some planning that has to be done, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12499)|
| 3:28:21| we're not expecting them to recreate a whole different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12501)|
| 3:28:23| lesson than what they did in their classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| that day. We're expecting them to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12505)|
| 3:28:27| move some things over that make sense electronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| for students to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| So, you know, so I guess I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| if we paused for a day and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| said, okay, everybody load up, it's like, what would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12515)|
| 3:28:37| load up because somebody might be out in three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12517)|
| 3:28:39| and it may not be what you're on at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| So, I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| where it gets complicated, knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| this may continue over the course of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| to do that. If they needed extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| training or they didn't understand something in Canvas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| and that sort of thing, we've continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| to have that available. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| everyone's not a master of it, but there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12535)|
| 3:28:57| are people at every school who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| and we would ask them first to look at your school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| and then we offer district trainings and supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| through Theresa Nixon and her staff and have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12543)|
| 3:29:05| that pretty much for the last two years. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12545)|
| 3:29:07| we would continue to do that. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12547)|
| 3:29:09| I mean, I'd love to give them time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| I'm just not sure that helps us in two or three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12555)|
| 3:29:17| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12559)|
| 3:29:21| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12561)|
| 3:29:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| What's the alternative to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12565)|
| 3:29:27| not putting the pressure on our teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12567)|
| 3:29:29| Because our teachers, they're looking like it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12569)|
| 3:29:31| April and it's only 18 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| in. So, what's the alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12573)|
| 3:29:35| to that and could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12575)|
| 3:29:37| that be, and I don't know, I don't know the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12577)|
| 3:29:39| but could it be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| the assignments that they have to do on Canvas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| is mirroring what's already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12583)|
| 3:29:45| with our virtual platform that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12585)|
| 3:29:47| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| we only have the virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| school staffed for, and they're held to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12591)|
| 3:29:53| the same requirements as far as class size and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12593)|
| 3:29:55| of that. So, the school that Ms. Hahn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| and Ms. Garrett have set up to run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| you know, we held them on staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| We didn't staff them fully. Once we knew we had about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| 700 people who were interested in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12603)|
| 3:30:05| we cut off the staffing at that point and staffed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12605)|
| 3:30:07| them to handle that. They have a little capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| but we've had some medically fragile kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12609)|
| 3:30:11| that have been moved into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12611)|
| 3:30:13| So, they don't have the capacity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12613)|
| 3:30:15| hold, you know. Okay, let me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12615)|
| 3:30:17| I wasn't clear. Can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12617)|
| 3:30:19| mirror the work that is in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12619)|
| 3:30:21| virtual, those for the grade levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| So, the student that's quarantined in 6th grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| at one particular school, can they do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12625)|
| 3:30:27| work of that week that is of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12627)|
| 3:30:29| calendar curriculum from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12629)|
| 3:30:31| A couple of assumptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12631)|
| 3:30:33| with that. If I could, yeah, you might want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12633)|
| 3:30:35| jump in and help. I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12635)|
| 3:30:37| one, not everybody's at the same place in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| everything, so it might not be, or there may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12639)|
| 3:30:41| be a course that's not offered in our virtual school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12641)|
| 3:30:43| that a student has that could be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| challenge, but I think there are some things we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12645)|
| 3:30:47| in the Canvas Commons, but I'll let,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12647)|
| 3:30:49| before I mess it up, I'll let Janet talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12649)|
| 3:30:51| Good evening, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12651)|
| 3:30:53| members of the board. Our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12653)|
| 3:30:55| has created common courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12655)|
| 3:30:57| that are based on our curriculum. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12657)|
| 3:30:59| in the Canvas Commons, and what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12659)|
| 3:31:01| heard this week is that we need to reshare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12661)|
| 3:31:03| where that material is and help our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12663)|
| 3:31:05| to find it, because that is a simple copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12665)|
| 3:31:07| from the Canvas Commons to put in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12667)|
| 3:31:09| Canvas courses. We can't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12669)|
| 3:31:11| for everybody. We can't roster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| every child to the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12673)|
| 3:31:15| courses, but what we can do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12675)|
| 3:31:17| make those courses available to our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12677)|
| 3:31:19| and let them pull what's relevant for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12679)|
| 3:31:21| where they are in their pacing, and make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12681)|
| 3:31:23| available to their students. So one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12683)|
| 3:31:25| of the things that Canvas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| allows us to do that I think, once we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| get really comfortable with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12689)|
| 3:31:31| is that it gives us also that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12691)|
| 3:31:33| time stamp of when students turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| in their work. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12695)|
| 3:31:37| remember as a classroom teacher, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12697)|
| 3:31:39| I had students turning in things late, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| wasn't in my stack of papers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12701)|
| 3:31:43| everybody else was turning in, keeping up with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12703)|
| 3:31:45| is really hard, especially when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| 100, 125| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12707)|
| 3:31:49| students in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12709)|
| 3:31:51| semester. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12711)|
| 3:31:53| when it's in Canvas, and the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12713)|
| 3:31:55| are submitting it at inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12715)|
| 3:31:57| times, you have that record that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| it was submitted, and it's easier for you to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12719)|
| 3:32:01| and find it. Also easier to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12721)|
| 3:32:03| that documentation to show a parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12723)|
| 3:32:05| when things were turned in or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12725)|
| 3:32:07| turned in. So it really, in the long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| run, will make it easier for our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12729)|
| 3:32:11| to keep up with all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12731)|
| 3:32:13| Okay. While you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12733)|
| 3:32:15| I think Ms. Babb has a question. Yeah, so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12735)|
| 3:32:17| sounds like there are some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12737)|
| 3:32:19| core classes already set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12739)|
| 3:32:21| It's almost like we just need to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12741)|
| 3:32:23| teachers how to use it. Another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| I was wondering about, because I just listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| to something the other day about Khan Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12747)|
| 3:32:29| and things like that that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12749)|
| 3:32:31| Are our teachers taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12751)|
| 3:32:33| advantage of things like that that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12753)|
| 3:32:35| established educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12755)|
| 3:32:37| things that are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12757)|
| 3:32:39| pretty good at instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12759)|
| 3:32:41| to maybe send their kids to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12761)|
| 3:32:43| that they're not having to recreate the wheel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12763)|
| 3:32:45| So teachers are using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12765)|
| 3:32:47| different materials such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12767)|
| 3:32:49| I think we do have quite a few who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12769)|
| 3:32:51| rely on Khan Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12771)|
| 3:32:53| We at one time had that connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12773)|
| 3:32:55| on our math page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12775)|
| 3:32:57| But our math department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12777)|
| 3:32:59| actually has gone through and created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12779)|
| 3:33:01| for elementary math, they have created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| instructional videos for every one of the topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| that they study. So there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12785)|
| 3:33:07| math video using the materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12787)|
| 3:33:09| that our teachers use and that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| kids can see. So that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| very connected to that material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12793)|
| 3:33:15| So that's also available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12795)|
| 3:33:17| in the Canvas Commons and in the YouTube page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12797)|
| 3:33:19| I recommend everybody check out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12799)|
| 3:33:21| our math YouTube page. So a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12801)|
| 3:33:23| of this that we're kind of talking about right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12803)|
| 3:33:25| and why it seems like we're sort of a late start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12805)|
| 3:33:27| is because of changes the state has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12807)|
| 3:33:29| to us. Is that correct? That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12809)|
| 3:33:31| As of last week, we did not think we could do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12811)|
| 3:33:33| We didn't think we could do this last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12813)|
| 3:33:35| and all of a sudden the state has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12815)|
| 3:33:37| kind of the rules again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12817)|
| 3:33:39| This is correct. Okay, that's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12819)|
| 3:33:41| helpful. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12821)|
| 3:33:43| Thank you, Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12823)|
| 3:33:45| Okay, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12825)|
| 3:33:47| Ms. Owen has her mic down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12827)|
| 3:33:49| and so if we can get her next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12829)|
| 3:33:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12831)|
| 3:33:53| Do we have a timeline for when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| teachers would be expected to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12835)|
| 3:33:57| things up and ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12837)|
| 3:33:59| At what point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| are their principals going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12841)|
| 3:34:03| why aren't your classes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| and ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12845)|
| 3:34:07| Thank you, Ms. Owen. I would say back to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12847)|
| 3:34:09| our expectation was in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12849)|
| 3:34:11| was that the Canvas was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| to be our backup for make-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12855)|
| 3:34:17| I think it could be varying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| degrees of that, but the expectation from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| the beginning, I know I myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12861)|
| 3:34:23| communicated that in the Principal's Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12863)|
| 3:34:25| I know Mr. Trent and Ms. Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12865)|
| 3:34:27| have followed up at least on two other occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12867)|
| 3:34:29| to that expectation to principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12869)|
| 3:34:31| I think to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12871)|
| 3:34:33| again, when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12873)|
| 3:34:35| as many employees as we do, people are going to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12875)|
| 3:34:37| that in different ways at different schools and that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| of thing, but that expectation has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12879)|
| 3:34:41| there already that that's happening and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12881)|
| 3:34:43| know there's been conversations in the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12883)|
| 3:34:45| That's not to say you wouldn't find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12885)|
| 3:34:47| a teacher who would say, I didn't know that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12887)|
| 3:34:49| that has kind of been our expectation all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12889)|
| 3:34:51| We hadn't really said anything out there to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12891)|
| 3:34:53| by September 15th all this needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12893)|
| 3:34:55| It was just always kind of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12895)|
| 3:34:57| expectation. I think since there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12897)|
| 3:34:59| more COVID cases, I think people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12899)|
| 3:35:01| have been more tuned into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| that, understanding that this is a real possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| and especially this latest thing we've heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12905)|
| 3:35:07| the Commissioner on the waiver this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12907)|
| 3:35:09| I think now people are really tuned into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12909)|
| 3:35:11| If it was kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12911)|
| 3:35:13| thought that I should probably do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12913)|
| 3:35:15| versus an expectation to do it, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12915)|
| 3:35:17| was clearly laid out from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| we still know people want to catch up time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| Again, I think principals will have grace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12921)|
| 3:35:23| with their teachers understanding this is year two of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12923)|
| 3:35:25| trying to do that, but I would say the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12925)|
| 3:35:27| expectation exists now and has since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| this summer that they should be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12929)|
| 3:35:31| I'm concerned that there may be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12931)|
| 3:35:33| breakdown in communication there somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12933)|
| 3:35:35| because I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12935)|
| 3:35:37| hearing you saying that that's been the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| expectation with principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| and what I've heard for the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| several days are teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12943)|
| 3:35:45| in tears because they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12945)|
| 3:35:47| been told everything's normal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12947)|
| 3:35:49| we're not doing all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12949)|
| 3:35:51| and so they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12951)|
| 3:35:53| extremely distressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12953)|
| 3:35:55| to suddenly be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12955)|
| 3:35:57| changing everything that they thought they were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| and it's not coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| one school or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| schools, it's coming from everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12963)|
| 3:36:05| We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12965)|
| 3:36:07| can continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| support that, put that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| there. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12971)|
| 3:36:13| obviously we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12973)|
| 3:36:15| not trying to cause stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| and unfortunately the situation we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12977)|
| 3:36:19| I don't want to paint it, I don't want to overpaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12979)|
| 3:36:21| the picture, it's no big deal because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| a big deal and it is work and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| effort on teachers' part to load| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12985)|
| 3:36:27| that and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12987)|
| 3:36:29| have, nor does anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12989)|
| 3:36:31| have that I'm aware of in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12991)|
| 3:36:33| a good plan to be able to do this. You either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12993)|
| 3:36:35| put teachers on this hybrid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12995)|
| 3:36:37| model that had everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12997)|
| 3:36:39| worn out by Christmas last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=12999)|
| 3:36:41| or you do an asynchronous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13001)|
| 3:36:43| model and it still requires some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13003)|
| 3:36:45| level of connection back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13005)|
| 3:36:47| teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13007)|
| 3:36:49| So I would agree, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13009)|
| 3:36:51| it's not ideal and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13011)|
| 3:36:53| I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13013)|
| 3:36:55| just need to be very aware at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| district level when we're looking at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13019)|
| 3:37:01| when they get to the point of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13021)|
| 3:37:03| not working somewhere, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13023)|
| 3:37:05| we need to be really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13027)|
| 3:37:09| that there are some places where teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13029)|
| 3:37:11| were not expecting to be doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| and so we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| really look at how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| support that. Sure, I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13037)|
| 3:37:19| a good word you said, support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| We'll be willing to try to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| if there are areas and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13043)|
| 3:37:25| we're hopeful that folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13045)|
| 3:37:27| will continue to reach out and talk to us, I mean there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| punitive for it. We want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13049)|
| 3:37:31| our schools to be prepared to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13051)|
| 3:37:33| to support their students and if they feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13053)|
| 3:37:35| they need the extra support, again I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13055)|
| 3:37:37| Teresa Nixon's team has been great at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13057)|
| 3:37:39| providing those kinds of supports, Shannon's team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| has been great instructionally to provide those as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13061)|
| 3:37:43| so we'll continue to gear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13063)|
| 3:37:45| up and try to clarify expectations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13065)|
| 3:37:47| again, not punitively, but support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13067)|
| 3:37:51| Alright, thank you. Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13071)|
| 3:37:53| Watson. Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13073)|
| 3:37:55| Dr. Ryswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| just to piggyback a little bit on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13077)|
| 3:37:59| Ms. Owen was saying, I've heard in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| challenges with getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13081)|
| 3:38:03| curriculum up in Canvas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13083)|
| 3:38:05| for curriculum we don't yet have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13085)|
| 3:38:07| So the new ELA curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13087)|
| 3:38:09| math curriculum in middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13089)|
| 3:38:11| so can you speak to that for a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13091)|
| 3:38:13| Because we've got a lot of stuff that's late for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13093)|
| 3:38:15| reasons outside of our control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13095)|
| 3:38:17| I'm going to let Shannon, because she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13097)|
| 3:38:19| has been part of this all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13099)|
| 3:38:21| but you're right, I will say this before Shannon comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13101)|
| 3:38:23| it's not been lack of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| effort from the district side to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13105)|
| 3:38:27| have that happen, but I'll let her explain the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13109)|
| 3:38:31| Thank you, Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| So we have digital access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13113)|
| 3:38:35| to almost everything, and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| materials, actually I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13117)|
| 3:38:39| even surprised how quickly our elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| reading department was able to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| material into Canvas Commons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| for the new reading series. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13125)|
| 3:38:47| they have created it, and it's up there ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| go, and it is aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13129)|
| 3:38:51| to the new materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| So the digital curriculum, we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| actually move that digital curriculum into another platform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| We can, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13137)|
| 3:38:59| So, yes, it's the print material that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| is slow. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13141)|
| 3:39:03| Another question, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13143)|
| 3:39:05| we haven't yet addressed the whole other part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| of this policy, which is around truancy, so I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13147)|
| 3:39:09| somebody to speak to that, because that's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13149)|
| 3:39:11| something that's potentially changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13151)|
| 3:39:13| One of the things I'm hearing, too, from some teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13153)|
| 3:39:15| is they have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13155)|
| 3:39:17| concerns still with some of their kids having access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13157)|
| 3:39:19| Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13159)|
| 3:39:21| are day students in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13161)|
| 3:39:23| computers, and that they don't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13163)|
| 3:39:25| their computer home because their parent hasn't turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| the form in, or they don't yet have internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13167)|
| 3:39:29| access, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| again, I don't want to penalize certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13171)|
| 3:39:33| students from being able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13173)|
| 3:39:35| still be counted present, so is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13175)|
| 3:39:37| anybody that can speak to that, what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=13177)|
