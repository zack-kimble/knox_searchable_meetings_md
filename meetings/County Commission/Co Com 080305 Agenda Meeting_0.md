| 0:01:09| Any additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=69)|
| 0:01:15| Mr. Weitrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| I would like to request that you add one resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| It's a resolution approving a contract with Duracap Asphalt for the hot mix hauling and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| placement contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Essentially, that's our resurfacing contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| That's the contract we use to resurface the various public roads in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| You asking for that to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| That's fine for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| I mean, it's okay with me to add it, just to have that to be added to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=102)|
| 0:01:51| We have two others, three others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| One is a memorial resolution honoring Bob Ray from having Harman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=115)|
| 0:02:05| We have another one, the Digital Surveillance System Equipment contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| This will be coming from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| And what is that, number 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| If you would look in your package on number 10, consideration of a community enhancement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=139)|
| 0:02:29| grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| The Sheriff's Department want to change that to $20,000 since they got five extra thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| So it's $20,000 instead of $15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| Is there any other additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| Commissioner Lampert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| You've got the one on the school there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Yeah, I wanted to change number 36, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| I wanted to change that to an ordinance, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| I would need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| If you want this to be as a charter amendment, yeah, you would need to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| Yeah, I'd like it to be a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| I will need to have whatever verbiage it is that you want to have within the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| to us so that we can draft that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Commissioner Lampert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| It says here, all taxes and or fee increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| I know that occasionally, like, I don't know if this would affect someone applying for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| zoning fee and occasionally MPC or the TTCDA or even sometimes, I don't know, Bruce, don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=226)|
| 0:03:54| you charge fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| I mean, so I guess we need to know which fees, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| Well, we're talking about things like the wheel tax, you know, where that is a, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| not a property tax, but it's a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| I think that if there was going to be a significant tax increase in the form of a fee that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=249)|
| 0:04:18| know, that that should go on a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| I mean, I'm not talking, you know, raising a nominal increase in the cost of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=260)|
| 0:04:30| permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| And that's what my question is, you know, if we're talking fees, I guess maybe when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| you write your, you know, the verbiage is to make sure that it doesn't include those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| types of things that need, I would think, need to be reacted a little quicker than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| maybe a referendum item would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| We're not talking about stuff that's going to be paid by everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| We're talking about wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| We're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Not necessarily a usage fee, such as permits and the zoning and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Just a question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Are there any other amendments needed to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| Seeing none, I guess the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| Mr. Chairman, if I can find it here, it's the number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| The discussion about the State Street site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| My recollection that we discussed the State Street site at our committee level, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=329)|
| 0:05:38| was at the, you know, if you remember last month, it was still a combined committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| And we decided, I thought, that at our regular meeting that it was simply we had already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| we didn't defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| We simply said we've already dealt with this item and it shouldn't be on this agenda because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| of a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| It wasn't deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| It was my recollection that we had already dealt with that committee and there was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| reason to deal with a discussion item since it's a non-voting item at our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| So, I think that this should be removed from our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| Well, it's my understanding that it comes from the clerk's office, so that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| easy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Well, then I think someone needs to make sure to research what they have in their minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| and make sure that it wasn't deferred, but if you'll just check on that and if it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| just simply that we've already dealt with it, then there's no reason to bring it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| up again this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| I remember it just like you, Commissioner, that's the way you remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Commissioner Leuthold, what was that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Is that okay with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Since you weren't on the commission at the time, we had discussed what, if we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| dispose of the property that we own on State Street or should we continue to hold on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=415)|
| 0:07:03| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| There was some discussion about we're not using it other than for a parking lot, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| then there's also the possibility that we have a lot of money invested in it, and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| right now, since we don't know where we might possibly need to expand jail facilities or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| an intake facility, that we might should hold on to it until we decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| I think it would be short-sighted to go ahead and dispose of it at this time, pending further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=447)|
| 0:07:35| discussion and seeing how things progress as far as our jail overcrowding, because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=455)|
| 0:07:43| still under the court mandate to keep the jail here under the 215, and we creep up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| that point quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| And I believe we sort of reached, we didn't take a vote, reached a consensus that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| wanting to keep that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Well, that seemed to be the consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| We didn't take a vote because it's a discussion item, and you don't take a vote on a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Most everyone agreed we need to, people with the committee meeting, agreed to keep it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| That would be my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Well, I remember it the same way both of you do, and what we'll do, we'll go to the clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| and make sure, go back through the tapes, and we'll take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| And if they have it as being deferred, then maybe they need to correct their minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| because that's the way, evidently, several of us remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| It's a request from the county mayor's office, and the county mayor would be glad to withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| Item 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Well, we're going to check on it and see what the tapes say, and I'm pretty sure what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| Pinkston and Lutho said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| That's our memory also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| That's what I remember also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Are there any other additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| Seeing none, as I said, the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| I have a couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| Commissioner, well, past commissioner, Kay would resign from the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| That's the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| I know you had some desire, Commissioner Lambert, to be on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Yeah, I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| If you're on zoning, I'm going to move you off of beer board, and, Commissioner Roundtree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| you'll be on beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Tank, how do we go about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| Does the full committee have to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| I'm talking about on chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Normally, the committee of committees have done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| I think the committees vote on the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Well, you think the board of zoning would vote on the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| The zoning committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| I think the BZA will elect their own chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| That's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| That's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| I just wanted to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| I heard some names circulating from the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| I certainly hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Maybe they're just aimed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| Are there any other things that need to come before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| Mr. Chairman, just so that people know, I am going to be out of the country for a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| over a week, and I will miss the intergovernmental meeting, being chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=624)|
| 0:10:31| And I also was told at the last commission meeting that Commissioner Norman, who's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| vice chair of that committee, will not be able to make that committee meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| So, I just wanted to let the members of intergovernmental know that on that day, they need to elect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| I guess, a temporary chairman for that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| Is that correct, Mr. Hall Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| Mr. Lutho, are you going to Poland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| No, I'm going to England.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| My son is on the Farragut High School rugby team, and they're going to England for about nine days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| I wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| I'm sure you've heard the rumor about the Poland trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| No, I haven't heard of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| I won't get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| I do know a very prominent North civilian in Poland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| You're moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| If he's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| When are you leaving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| I'll be leaving on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| You'll be back for the full committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| I'll be back for the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| On the 12th, remember, we have our charter amendment workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| On the 17th, we have the after end of governmental and finance, the solid waste facility workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=707)|
| 0:11:57| Is there anything else that needs to come before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| Seeing none, agenda meeting's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080305agendameeting?start=722)|
