| 0:01:35| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| Any opposed? The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| Are there any items to be withdrawn? Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| Thank you, Mayor. Yes, I would like to postpone item 9L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=107)|
| 0:01:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| That is the Jerry Green rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Right. Now, two people have signed up to speak. They could only speak to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| Do you want to hear that or is that – do they want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Oh, thank you. Postpone four weeks. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| And I'm sorry, now what, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| There were two people that signed up to speak, Terry Faulkner and Tom McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| They could – since we have a motion to postpone, they could only speak to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Is that what you wish to do, Mr. McAdams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Or Mrs. Faulkner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Both. And I think if Mr. Green is here for him to speak if he wants also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| I think there's a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| I have another postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Okay. Good evening, Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| Good evening, Mayor. I'm Tom McAdams, 1043 Craigland Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| I would urge you not to postpone this matter and to go ahead and hear it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| I don't know what would change in four weeks that would change anyone's position on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| It's a C-4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| The only reason given for it was the applicant's desire to open a used car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| That's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| He wants to open a used car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| The people who are opposed to it are adamantly opposed to C-4 zoning in that area to a change from F-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| That's not going to change in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| It's not the sort of thing where a few shrubs in front or a setback is going to change anyone's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| C-4 zoning is just inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| The four reasons under the city code that you are required to find exist in order to change the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| are not going to change in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| There's not going to be a major citywide change in commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| There's not going to be a major change in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| Just none of the factors that you should base your decision on are going to change in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| I understand the natural tendency to try to avoid the controversy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| and there is a controversy over this one, but that's not going to change in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| We think the better plan would be to hear it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| We hope you'll deny it tonight and then ask MPC to study the whole area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| and that's not going to change in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| So we would urge you not to postpone this and to proceed with the hearing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Ms. Faulkner, do you wish to speak to the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Okay, I don't see her here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| Mr. Green, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Would you like to speak to the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| I'm with Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| I wouldn't really care to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| I don't really want to wait either because, as he said, there's nothing that's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| The whole reason that we're here tonight with the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| is because the whole thing that was put out and blast-mailed to every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| is about how the South North Shore is going to change forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| And the truth to that whole matter is it cannot change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| It's F1 from up at the very front of Kingston Pike all the way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| You cannot change it unless there is an atomic bomb and some way something happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| because it cannot by the laws that unless the U.S. government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| come down here and brought it out of the flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| So I'm with Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| There is nothing to change about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| I went to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| It was 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| I came here before every one of you and told you about my case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| and it's not going to change tonight either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| I'm a small businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| I've came down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| I've worked hard my whole 20 years down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| I haven't asked for nothing that affects the area in any derogatory way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| I mean, I'm doing it right now beside it for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| And for somebody to throw something out and make it into a way that it's going to change forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=348)|
| 0:05:57| Tom is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Nothing is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| So I'm all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| If he wants to hear it tonight, I'm ready too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Okay, is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| We have a motion and a second to postpone 9L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| Would you like to speak, Councilman Stanton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| What do we hope to achieve by the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| Are you asking me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| I mean, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| Well, this has been a difficult situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| and partly what has happened is that a couple hours before the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| this came to light that there was opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| And there's been talk on the fact that people didn't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| In fact, it was under my radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| I'm not sure that my other council members saw it when it went before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| There's been talk that the sign wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| There's been a lot of e-mails, a lot of telephone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| I'm sure that my fellow colleagues have gotten as much information in the last couple days as I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| And I think that one of the things, and Mr. Green has now said to go ahead and hear it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| I think one of the things that we were looking at at one time is whether or not it's possible to even send it back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| to see if there's another zone that might be able to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| We also wanted to look at the fact that if, in fact, it's the C4 that is the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| is it possible that there's some way in which he can continue to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| and do his business on that lot adjacent to where he is doing the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| There's ways in which, and we just haven't had the time to really get totally involved in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| there are ways in which you can put conditions on property that go with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| It doesn't necessarily go with Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| Are there ways in which we are able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| Basically, I think what one of the reasons that we were asking for the postponement in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| was that we haven't really had time to see whether or not there's a way that we can get the two parties together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| to see if there is a way to come up with a compromise in order for Mr. Green to continue with his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| and yet at the same time have the neighborhood, our neighborhoods in this particular situation, satisfied with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| There's also been additional information that's come up this afternoon that I feel that I haven't had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| to really decipher and get into in terms of some other people that have weighed in on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| And my thought was that as much as I don't particularly want you folks or us to have to continue to deal with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| and with all the e-mails and telephone calls and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| that I think that if there's a way in which we can be fair to the neighborhoods and fair to the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| the small business person who's trying to make a living and who's contributing to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| not only through sales of the automobiles, but sales of his business and his employment taxes and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| that if there's a way in which we can find a compromise, I think that that's what we ought to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| and that we ought to try to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| So is four weeks going to make a difference? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| Maybe that everyone's already made up their mind where we stand on this and that that's what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| But that was the reason that I was asking for a postponement to see if there is any possible way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| to come up with some kind of compromise between the parties involved in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| Because I'm sure that all of you have heard from constituents all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| And so I think it's something that I know that all of us are taking seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| And will more time help? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| Okay. Actually, do we have a second on that? I thought we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| But was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Okay. Did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| So, Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Yeah. It strikes me that in light of the positions taken at the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| that we would be wise to hear what has to be said by both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| And even if the conclusion at the end of that is postpone it for some reason that Mr. Greave has suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| we can always do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| But I think we should hear and be better informed on the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| Otherwise, we're sending sort of a, I don't know, a cloudy lob to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| to do something that we don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| I think we should hear the folks and just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| Just get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Yeah, let's hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| You can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Okay. Well, the only rebuttal that I would have to that is I'm going to assume that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| Councilman Greave has told people not to come here tonight to show support either for or against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| that it was going to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| And I think to do that would be, you know, I don't think it would be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| And I don't know that you've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| I won't assume that you've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| And, I mean, the people aren't here that represent both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| I mean, you've got two folks here that aren't probably a few more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| But I think had they known we were going to hear it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| I think there would probably be a few more people out there than there are this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| That's just my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| I'm going to support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| In terms of postponement, it just seems like both parties just got up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| and neither one wanted to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| I don't think much is going to change in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| So I think it makes sense to go ahead and hear it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| I see Ms. Faulkner has arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Ms. Faulkner, we already heard from both sides, both not wanting postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| You signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Do you wish to speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| You would have to speak to the postponement only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=708)|
| 0:12:09| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| I had asked to be taken off the speakers earlier, but maybe it didn't get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| And since I didn't hear that earlier, I'm not, you know, I can't speak for Bearden Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| without speaking to the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| And I'm not sure I understand what's happened either since I just came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| So we have a motion and a second to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| This is 9L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=762)|

| 0:12:47| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| You want a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=772)|

| 0:12:56| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| House is 5-4 so it is postponed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you all for being here and speaking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| More items to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| 12C is the corridor overlay and this is something that we have been studying for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| The administration and the law department are continuing to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| We will be having a new MPC director so I would like to ask that we postpone this for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| This is the corridor overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| It is 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| And also, Council, Ms. Carlene Malone has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| So, Ms. Malone, if you want to speak, you can speak to the postponement motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=838)|
| 0:14:07| In the meanwhile, Councilman Wallace, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| Yeah, well, I guess I am caught off guard on that one too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| I was hoping it would be less than six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| It has been on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| I think we have kicked it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| We have gotten word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| We have had a workshop on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| I am ready to vote on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| But six months, that is like a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| We have an MPC chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Ms. Branscom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Hold on just a minute, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Yeah, we do need to study it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| We did have some comments that we took back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| and with the change in administration and the leadership at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| we have not been able to really iron out those details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| as to how this corridor overlay district is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| If you want to shorten the period of time, we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| but we were really hoping to be able to get new leadership into the MPC director position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| and work with that new director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| We have people standing, you know, waiting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| I mean, you know, have been waiting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| So, I mean, they are organizing behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| So, I mean, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| I have not heard of anybody waiting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I have heard people say they are organizing behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| saying, you know, they are ready, you know, they are willing to get organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| to get, you know, to start bringing that forward in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Then what we can do as soon as we get someone in that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| we can start that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| And, you know, I can tell you, maybe we postpone it for six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| but we will try to jump on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| That will be one of our first priorities once we get a director in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| Did you want to speak to this, Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Perhaps we should table this and then we can bring it back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| Would that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| May I amend my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| The second permits it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| We can move that to a table, motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| At any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| You can come back at any time then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| I have been to many, many meetings about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| and I am sure there are people somewhere organizing behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| but we would like it if they would step out of their shadows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| and we would like to see them at a meeting someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Obviously, I will defer to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| It is very important with something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| which will affect the entire city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| that we get it right and get it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| And I think Town Hall, Fountain City Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| who I am here speaking on behalf of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Town Hall has regularly attended the meetings, provided comments, done the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| We would like to be included in whatever deliberations take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| We will continue to check the newspapers and the agendas and try to keep in step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| But we would like to have dialogue of people who are interested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| so that we do not end up at the last minute, people just showing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| and frankly not understanding where we have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| and the issues that we think are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| So we certainly go along with the wisdom of council in the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Motion to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Okay, thank you, Mrs. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| So we have a motion to table 12C, the corridor overlay zone ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Okay, that is tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| Anything else for postponement or to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| Are there any moving items on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Do you want to make a motion for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| If I could, I would like to move up in the agenda 11A through E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1072)|
| 0:18:02| And if it would please the council, I would like to move 12A to the heel of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| And I will make a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| End of the agenda before public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| What happens to the first group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| 11A through E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| 11A through E, those are resolutions honoring our football teams and some renamings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| that the public property naming committee dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| That would be moved up to right after elections and confirmations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| And then move 12A to the end of the agenda before public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Okay, so there is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Do we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Okay, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Is everybody sure 12A is about the mayor's salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| Just in case you hadn't found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| And I will be recusing myself and Vice Mayor Pavlis will be chairing the meeting at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1133)|
| 0:19:04| So there is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| All moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Anything else to be moved, postponed, added, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| Withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Anybody want to withdraw some here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| So now we have consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| 11P through W are pensions and 11X and Y certificates of compliance and 12E is a 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1162)|
| 0:19:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| The ayes have it and the consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| For the mayor's report, I hope you all enjoyed Martin Luther King holiday yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| There was a beautiful day for a parade and we had a wonderful parade down Martin Luther King Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| and a wonderful memorial church service and concert last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| So I want to thank the MLK Commemorative Commission, which puts on these events each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| They do a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| And we have included among the many volunteers throughout the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| some of our staff members are actively involved, like Mr. Tank Strickland and Jackie Clay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| Josh and Hunley, and Tasha Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| And also I want to recognize the co-chairs, Ms. Renee Kessler, who has been the co-chair for 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| and she has now announced her retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| And she was honored yesterday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| So she did a great job over these past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| And Clarence Vaughn has served as the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| So we certainly thank them and all of the members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| And, you know, these, you all know how important it is that we remember what Martin Luther King stood for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1236)|
| 0:20:44| and really not only what he stood for, but how much more we still have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| We've made a lot of progress, I think, over the years, but there's still more that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| And I think that's what these events remind us of year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| A few more things that I want to call to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| On Monday, January 26th at 1.30, we will have the ribbon-cutting for the Prosser Road construction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| As you all know, this has been a need for many years to address the persistent flooding problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| on that section of the road near the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| This is part of the capital project package that council approved on last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1273)|
| 0:21:24| And so please join me and Councilman and Mayor Brown and city staff as we're out there to showcase that work that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1284)|
| 0:21:32| That's Monday, the 26th at 1.30 at Prosser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| Also on Thursday, the 29th, so next Thursday, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| there will be a public blood drive at the Civic Coliseum to help Captain Jeff Stiles of our Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| And I'm going to ask Chief Rouse to say a few words about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Captain Stiles, early last year, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| and he's been receiving treatment since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| And he has been, for the past few weeks, he's been over at Vanderbilt Hospital receiving some additional treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1324)|
| 0:22:13| And so this is a way for us to, as a community, to show our support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| Captain Stiles has served this community for over 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| And so it's our opportunity to give back to him and to show him our support as a community to help him as he goes through this battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1345)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Again, that's Thursday, January 29th, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Council, just a reminder that our annual budget retreat will take place on Friday, February 6th, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| This will be at the Convention Center, like last year, in Room 200, A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| And this is our midyear review of our current budget year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| and the first step towards consideration of next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| As always, Jim York will give us a status report on revenues and expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| and we'll also talk about where we are in some of the major projects included in our current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| So we'll see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| And finally, I have some good news, a report from our annual Consolidated Charities Giving Campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| As you all know, every year we make an effort to encourage city employees to contribute to the local charities at whatever levels they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1401)|
| 0:23:29| We have a variety of efforts, including competitions between departments and directors to see who can increase giving the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| And I'm pleased to announce that for 2015, we increased total giving of city employees by 35 percent from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1415)|
| 0:23:44| City employees pledged a total of almost $89,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| This includes about 54,000 pledged to United Way, 20,000 to community health charities, and 14,000 to community shares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1429)|
| 0:23:58| I want to especially thank Lieutenant Savannah Aube of the Knoxville Police Department for again leading this campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| She always does a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| And the members of the campaign committee include Chip Berry, Kathy Ellis, Penny Owens, and Patricia Robledo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| Also, as part of the campaign, we engaged in some friendly challenges, you might remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| which were announced at the United Way kickoff last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Mayor Burgett and I challenged each other over whose employees could increase their United Way contributions the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| And Chief Roush and Chief Sharp had a similar challenge between police and fire personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| So I can now announce that the winners of those challenges, city employees increased their giving substantially more than county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1474)|
| 0:24:42| A little round of applause, please, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| Shave his head? Does he have to shave his head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| No, and the fire department outpaced the police department more than doubling fire department contributions from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| We've got a lot of firefighters out here. Let's give a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1497)|

| 0:25:11| We're under negotiations about that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| I talked to him this afternoon, and so all I can say is we're under negotiations on what will happen and when that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1514)|
| 0:25:22| And Chief Roush, I think it means that you and your officers will be cleaning some of Chief Sharp's fire engines in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| and I'm sure he won't give you the biggest, dirtiest, grimeyest trucks, but I can't promise that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| So anyway, I want to thank all of our employees for their generosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| and our city workers serve the community every day in their regular jobs, but this is really going above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=1539)|

| 0:36:54| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| Okay, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Yeah, thank you, Mayor. I want to point out tonight I'll be accusing myself in the vote and I feel it necessary to explain further about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2219)|
| 0:37:10| So if you'll indulge me in an opportunity to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| My company, Coldwell Banker, Wallace & Wallace, listed that property for sale. It did close on April 16, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2235)|
| 0:37:28| There were no further commissions after that or nothing was due after that. That contract ended at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2248)|
| 0:37:37| After that, one of my agents, unbeknownst to me until today, listed the property for the owner, current owner, Mrs. Bradley, for lease and for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2257)|
| 0:37:48| That listing agreement expired on December 31, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| I came aware of that today with over 300 sales associates and 1,300 active listings at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2274)|
| 0:38:02| It's impossible for me to keep aware of what properties we have listed or which our agents are involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| Since this afternoon, I have talked to Mr. Frost and Mr. Swanson and Mrs. Bradley to inform them and I will be recusing myself from this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2290)|
| 0:38:19| However, I was under no contract. Our company was under no contract and received no financial gain at all from Mrs. Bradley to list a property for sale or for lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2299)|
| 0:38:29| That contract has expired and was expired by the time we voted on it on January 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| I don't feel that it's necessary that it was a conflict of interest, but being that it's been raised and that I want to protect the integrity of the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2316)|
| 0:38:45| and the integrity of City Council and my own integrity, that if it's a hint of impropriety, I want to take the high road and recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| I have since put out a memo to mainly my commercial agents, the 15 commercial agents that work for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| and asked them to diligently let me know if they're involved in any lease or sale that may be before Council and before this body for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| There's two additional property amendments. Because of that action and because of those conversations this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| I will be recusing myself from those two votes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| It's unfortunate. I spent a lot of time studying this and upon this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| I appreciate someone bringing it forward and I think this is the best and the best for the city and the best for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2367)|
| 0:39:36| So I will be recusing myself. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Thank you, Councilman Wallace. Councilman Dalvopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| Yes, I don't know if we have people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| But, you know, this question, the last time it came up was fairly well divided amongst City Council folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2386)|
| 0:39:55| And I think it's important, it may have been neglected to have observed it at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| but there were 30 nearby residents who objected to this change in the sector plan, in the one-year plan, and in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2401)|
| 0:40:11| And I think that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| I mean, it's acknowledged and admitted that this is in the middle of a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| There has been a tradition of sort of breaking the commercial line once you cross that railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| And I think it's important to hear the voice of the neighbors and the people surrounding there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| that they do not want to see their R1 residential zone area broken down and eroded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| And that seems to be, you know, this is like the first step in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| I think there is a danger that we diminish that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| When you couple that with the traffic in that area, the danger of cars pulling out onto the busy Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| I think it's one that we should think long and hard on and not approve the change to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| We have heard that this property was examined and reviewed by the city codes people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| and they acknowledged that it has a grandfathered office status that is protected by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| And it came down to the last time it seemed like there was an issue about whether the original sign was grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| or whether additional signs were needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| It strikes me that changing the zone for that is pretty extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| There certainly are ways to go to the BZA and get an exception for the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| I think our own either sign committee or the council, when they act on stuff like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| can say if you've got a grandfathered office condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| you certainly ought to be able to have the amenities that an office one zone would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| And if that includes some reasonable signage to tell the world you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| I don't see why our sign ordinance couldn't recognize that you, by comedy, have the right to apply for such a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2519)|
| 0:42:07| So I'm urging my colleagues to rethink this in terms of not breaking the zone there, the R1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2527)|
| 0:42:16| that does protect that community and that neighborhood area and to deny the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| with the understanding that at the present time at least, and I don't know of any reason why it would change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| that office use is considered grandfathered and protected and can continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| That's really what I wanted to say at this point. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Thank you, Councilman. We do have people signed up to speak for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| Those speaking for are in this order. Cindy Bradley, Betty Jo Mahan, and Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| So would you all like to proceed, Ms. Bradley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| Maybe we go a little out of order. Ms. Bradley is asking me to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Certainly. That's fine. Let me get my timer up here for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| Go right ahead and state your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| I am here on behalf of the applicant. I am mayor and members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| I will not reiterate everything I said last time but just hit some of the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| This property has been treated as if it was zoned office since back in the 80s and perhaps before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2600)|
| 0:43:29| At one time it was a Presbyterian church. I don't know what the Presbyterians called it when they stopped using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| We would deconsecrate it as an Episcopalian, but I don't know whether it was officially done or how they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| But anyway, it has not been used as a place of worship for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| It has been used as an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| The city has issued permits acknowledging that it is an office building during renovations a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2631)|
| 0:44:00| You will hear from Ms. Mahan in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| She is head of the Enskip Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| During the past two or three years she and her organization have studied the zoning in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2647)|
| 0:44:15| They have engaged in collaboration with the city of Knoxville and the MPC in having a general rezoning of the Enskip neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2655)|
| 0:44:25| They do not object to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Ms. Bradley, as a matter of fact, before she purchased the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| talked to Betty Jo to see what her neighborhood association and her neighbors would think about her buying the property and rezoning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2672)|
| 0:44:44| And they received no opposition at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| And as a matter of fact, Betty Jo spoke in favor of it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| Regardless of whether the conditions are valid or not that MPC put on the property, they will always be on the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2694)|
| 0:45:06| And Ms. Bradley fully intends to comply with those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| However, with or without the conditions, this zoning only makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| I think most of you all have been to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| It is not suitable for a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| It is suitable only for an office use and an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| And certainly zoning ought to recognize what a building is being used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| and what it has been used for for these many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| So this is not a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| Ms. Bradley, if she can get it rezoned and get a modest sign, which the sign ordinance allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| and I don't think it's being changed for an office building under the proposed zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| she intends to have a title company, a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| These people will all rent the property from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| Somebody, another fellow that has an office, needs an office for his business and a dance studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| The dance studio would not survive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| It's a children's dance studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| It would not survive there unless they can have some signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| So I think Ms. Bradley will be forced to do nothing other than have her office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2779)|
| 0:46:26| And a large part of the building, if she cannot get the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| will return to the disuse it has had for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| The building has essentially been vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| And you know what a vacant building does, ultimately, and who it attracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| So I would urge you to approve this zoning on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| If I have any time, can I have it for rebuttal, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| That's not the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| I always try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Yeah, I know you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| I always expect you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Less than are they persistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Hi, Ms. Mahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Let me start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Betty Jo Mahan, 5325 Rowan Road, which is just down from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| And I spoke to Mark Campin, and I just wanted to let him know and wanted to let you know, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| that I did talk to more than a handful of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| And I've e-mailed people since, I think it was, I looked today, it was August, September, and October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2844)|
| 0:47:31| to let them know that that rezoning was happening and going to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| And it was more a lack of people saying anything to the e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| And then the people that I talked to had no problem as long as it was just office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| and not going to anything like apartments or halfway houses or some of the other uses that were listed in 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2865)|
| 0:47:53| So I just wanted to set the record straight there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| And, of course, we did not discuss a sector plan change to change everything from office down to the railroad at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2876)|
| 0:48:06| because I don't really think that's appropriate now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| And, like I say, that hadn't been discussed or even brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| All we talked about was it would be a good use of the building, it would keep the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| it would make the area look about the same, and it would not leave it open for some kind of other use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| that wouldn't be appropriate in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| And that's what we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| And I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2910)|

| 0:48:32| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Ms. Bradley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| Cindy Bradley, 1308 Fieldwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| I'm the owner of the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| I have spoken to many, many, many, many people in the area, have a lot of clients, friends, church members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| that live in the area, and they've all been very, very supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| I have quite a number of people here tonight that have come in support of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| I could have had hundreds of names on a petition had I wanted to take the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| Aside from all the rhetoric, it is an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| It has been an office building since 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| I'm trying to simply make it legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| Everyone says I can put a sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| The city assures me I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| The law department says I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| I don't think I can apply for a sign in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| You know, we want to be a positive thing for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| Contrary to the things going around on the blogs, I happen not to be a little rich girl that flips properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2968)|
| 0:49:36| I graduated from an inner city high school, very proud Fulton graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| Have never worked less than a 50-hour work week in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| I have a high school diploma, and I'm self-made, and I'm proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| And I contribute to my community, and I'm here trying to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and the rest of it is going to be up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| Thank you, Ms. Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| Okay, now those who are against this, Carleen Malone and then Ryan Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| Mr. Bradley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3017)|
| 0:50:21| Yeah, it's Ryan Bradley, 601 Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| You almost think I'll wear scrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| This is the second time I've been here in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| I want to say that Councilman De La Lope kind of took a lot of the words out of my mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| with maintaining the integrity of the area and keeping it R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| But then I also want to touch on some kind of new points that I didn't make last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| I mean, I've already talked about the 30 people that have signed the petition against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| I also would like to know, this Inskipp Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| I'm wondering why I didn't get an invitation to their neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| or anybody that's in opposition of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| We do live in Inskipp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| It seems to me that Knoxville has a problem with vacant office and commercial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3071)|
| 0:51:18| Looking just around five miles around 609 Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| there are 56 available office and commercial spaces for rent in that area alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| And I'm concerned if we move it beyond the railroad tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| and talk about rezoning everybody 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| how many more vacant office buildings do we really need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| If you look at 01 zoning, it allows a 6 by 6 foot sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| which is not really that much larger than her 4 by 4, 5 by 5 that she has available now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| I'm wondering how much exposure she's really looking to gain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| from an extra foot here or there on her sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3122)|
| 0:52:11| Additionally, the annex has been for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| I know it's been taken down at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| And there has been people there looking at the possibility of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3138)|
| 0:52:30| I feel like he's there looking for subdividing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| He was surveying the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| So we feel that she's going to try to subdivide that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| and sell it off in order to make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| I mean, she got this property at a deeply discounted rate because of its zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| I think she paid $160,000 according to the records that we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| And she's trying to sell the annex for $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| She's not really at risk of losing any money on this, it doesn't seem like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| because if you look at how much she's put on the rental of the annex alone at $5,000 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3185)|
| 0:53:14| it would take her only 32 months to lease that side of the building to recoup her money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| But I just feel like it's more about money than it is a sign, since she already has a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3201)|
| 0:53:36| And I guess that's all I really have to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| So I'll let Carlene talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you, Mr. Bradley. Mrs. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3221)|
| 0:53:56| Again, thank you for being here. You know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| Members of Council, Mayor Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, on behalf of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| I'd like to repeat our comments from Town Hall from the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| In addition, I will add to the record our November 2nd, January 5th letters to City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| a new Sentinel article dated November 12th regarding traffic problems along this section of Cedar Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3260)|
| 0:54:26| and a page from the 2014 one-year plan on land use designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| I would also like to repeat the comments of Tom McAdams earlier on a different rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| where he spoke about how the standards for rezoning have not been met, and the same is true here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3278)|
| 0:54:47| Members of Council, the plan amendment rezoning that you're considering tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| will bring a fundamental and profound change to Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| Unfortunately, we got here due to a poorly thought-out land use designation, CI, civic institution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3294)|
| 0:55:02| that was introduced in the north and west city sectors in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| and mechanically put on the map wherever there was a church or a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| What has followed is increasingly tortured logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| At the last meeting, you were told that putting office zoning in the middle of an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| that is zoned solidly residential, which is what this is, from the railroad tracks to Broadway at Knox Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| is not spot zoning because it's based on an adopted plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| And you were told that the one-year plan amendment and rezoning were to fix an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| That is, office, not the present residential zoning, must be put in place to have the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| and zoning consistent with the CI, civic institution designation of the 2007 sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| Let's look at the sector plan and the CI, civic institutional land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| Both the sector and the one-year plan say that CI is for, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| land used for major public and quasi-public institutions, including schools, colleges, the university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| churches, correction facilities, hospitals, utilities, and similar uses, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| Here's the problem. NBC said that all of those uses, those very uses, are inappropriate for this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3371)|
| 0:56:19| and prohibited churches, public and private schools, art galleries, museums, all correctional facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3379)|
| 0:56:26| In other words, NBC prohibited the uses that are, in fact, the CI, civic institution designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3386)|
| 0:56:35| major public and quasi-public institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| What NBC has proposed is, in fact, contrary to the sector plan and is in no way consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| In short, if the rezoning and plan amendments are necessary in order to be consistent with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| and necessary to avoid a determination of spot zoning, then we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| And the problem is that the very uses of the plan have been prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| Furthermore, the CI designation says that zones permitted in CI are, quote, 01, 02, and other zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3424)|
| 0:57:12| that allow civic and institutional uses as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| Unfortunately, the 01 zone does not allow churches as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| It allows them as a use permitted on review, just as the present R1 zoning allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3442)|
| 0:57:30| And the R1 zoning caused problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| In the opinion of NBC, most of the 01 permitted uses are inappropriate for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| To fix that problem, a legally suspect step was taken, prohibiting 13 out of 15 permitted uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3458)|
| 0:57:45| and all uses permitted on review in the 01 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| Council, the problem is the CI sector plan designation, not the one-year plan or the zoning at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3469)|
| 0:57:58| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| And just how do you prohibit a permitted use, which Article 4, Section 2.0.1 states are uses permitted by right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| Do you have any standards for prohibiting these uses by right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3489)|
| 0:58:17| And if there are no standards, I would say arbitrary and capricious is a real possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| At the last meeting, much was said about the need for a sign as being part of the reason for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| There's a monument sign on the property at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| That sign was legal as a sign for the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| Article 5, Section 10, C.3 permits a 6-foot high sign, 36-square foot monument sign for a church in an R1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3516)|
| 0:58:45| That is the same size and same type of sign that is permitted at present in the 01 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| Monument, 36 square feet, 6 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| If the church buildings and office uses are grandfathered, then it would seem that the existing sign is also grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3535)|
| 0:59:02| And under 13.7208, that sign can be taken down, rebuilt, and moved on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3542)|
| 0:59:09| Members of Council, this neighborhood deserves thoughtful consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| It is the kind of neighborhood we hear all the time that we need in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you, Ms. Stallone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Okay, Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| Well, obviously there's a lot of zoning issues and legal unknowns, I think, in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| and a bigger picture should be looked at in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| I don't think anybody thinks Ms. Bradley is disingenuous, and we wish her success with her business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| but again, I'm not very supportive of rezoning this one particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| I think the future unknowns, there's been no legal satisfying answer that I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| of what someone may or may not do in the future on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| So for that reason, I can't support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=3595)|

| 1:17:50| I would like to point out that the one neighborhood that they're bringing as the supporters is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| a mobile home park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| I have emails from other surrounding neighborhoods of residential properties who are not in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| I believe there are some people here from Autumn Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| We've had emails from Oakley Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| We aren't alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| There are several surrounding neighborhoods who do not want this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| We've seen in the papers there have been several robberies at the local Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| Dollar General pretty much across the board caters to a lower end clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| I believe they are wanting to put one there to service the mobile home park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| I believe it's going to hurt our property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| I guess I just leave it in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Would you want this in your front yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| To address that they've changed ... I didn't even see what you presented as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| photographs, but I don't think they've raised any roof lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| I don't know how many trees they have on there, if they meet the requirement as far as how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| many trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| When I looked ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| You have 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| The way it was supposed to be for RP1 that is zoned for commercial purposes, when parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4743)|
| 1:19:12| areas are not enclosed within a structure, they shall be screened by evergreen planting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| that will obtain a minimum of five feet within a period of one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| All I know is the previous proposal had eight red maples, which are deciduous trees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| six crepe myrtles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4764)|
| 1:19:25| I don't know how many evergreens are on this proposal, but I doubt there's enough room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| with the encroachments to actually screen the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| There isn't enough room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4775)|

| 1:19:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| This issue is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| It is an area that has the subdivision that is where the Seven Springs appellant lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4781)|
| 1:19:55| When this first was going to MPC for use on review, the neighbors contacted me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| I pointed out to them at that time that this was a use on review and that this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| is zoned neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| Whether we like a Dollar General store, whether we want a fresh market or whatever on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4810)|
| 1:20:17| property, what is proposed to go at that site is exactly the intent that dates back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4817)|
| 1:20:24| to 1994 when the property was rezoned to planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4824)|
| 1:20:34| I could not support an appeal on this, and even though I was asked to go to MPC and speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| I did not go then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| I'd like to hear anything my colleagues might have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Yeah, I'm really kind of taking back the statement about Dollar General stores attracting a lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4849)|
| 1:20:57| clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| I don't know that to be the case and or about the statement about robberies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| I mean, you know, I read a lot about robberies at banks and, you know, various, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| that anybody is immune to robberies and particularly taking back a little bit about response times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4869)|
| 1:21:17| I'd like to know where your foundation for that comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4877)|
| 1:21:31| I guess my first response about the lower end clientele, when you go to the Dollar General's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| website and you read the median income is $75,000 or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| And if you look at where the Dollar Generals in town are located, there are four within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| a very, very stone's throw proximity of Knoxville Housing Authority projects, I think it projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| an image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| And I think I don't want that image in front of our neighborhood where we would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| maintain our values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| We would like our values to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| And I think if you were honest with yourself, I think you would probably say that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| want it in your front yard either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| As far as the response times from emergency personnel, having lived in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| for 13 years, I've had to utilize emergency response, whether it be for police or ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| And we've seen 16, 17 minutes for response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| I think if you congest the area even further, you're asking for problems, not only from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| emergency personnel, but maybe on getting kids home from the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| Well, I mean, I guess I don't want to debate it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| I truly question 16 or 17 minutes response time from our uniformed bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| I've lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| That's all I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| I mean, the $75,000 range, that's pretty substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| I mean, I represent a district that I'd welcome it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| I would agree $75,000 is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| I've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| We're not going to debate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| I would welcome this store in my district as I would in your district as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| I mean, it looks like that they've gone over and above what they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| And so, I mean, I just wanted to hear, I don't hear really where you're justifying some of the things that you're alleging here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=4995)|
| 1:23:25| Mr. Seymour, I have a question for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| Can I say one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| You know, I can ask Mr. Seymour a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| When you say a neighborhood prototypical store, I mean, what is the difference in the stores that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5015)|
| 1:23:43| 9,100 square feet is their smallest store and designed for a very local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| They have bigger stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| There's one on Emory Road that's a market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| I don't know how big that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| I think they vary within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| But the 9,100 square feet is for a very small area to be serviced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5043)|
| 1:24:11| The 9,100 square foot, did you say 9,100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| 9,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| And you may not know, but I don't know if you do or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| but, I mean, is it more lends itself to more of a mixture of a grocery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5058)|
| 1:24:24| or a convenience type as opposed to more of a hardware or I don't know what the terminology would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5064)|
| 1:24:32| The larger stores are going to food markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| And I will confess, my wife shops at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| She loves them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| But, yeah, Tim, maybe you ought to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| Their 9,100 square foot prototype is the one they have many thousands of built every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| They have moved towards more refrigerated units for convenience sake, more frozen food, more milk, more eggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| more of that one-stop convenience that is their hallmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| The outside of the building, as far as the prototype goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| that 9,100 square feet is typically a metal panel building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| with a little bit of split-faced block on the front where the entrance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| And what we're doing in this case is very much in excess of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| And they typically do respond to local MPC requirements, zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| when there's calls for brick, decorative, ethos, you know, stucco colors, even signage requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| They always go to fit the neighborhood they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| And I think they've made an excellent effort in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| and what's above and beyond the normal prototyping cost to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| And this is actually not for your body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| It's for the requirements that were presented by the Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| Yes, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| The last speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| What's the closest Dollar General to that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| I can Google it and find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| I think they actually presented some good details on what was closest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| There was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| I think there are several miles or in excess of three to four miles to a Dollar General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| to another Dollar General store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| Two miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| You can certainly look at all their locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| And when you look in northwest Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| they are a lot closer than even a couple, three miles in some areas of town, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| In the west Knoxville location we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| there's a circle of Dollar Generals in the area that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| where this one is proposed is right in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| It fills a big blank spot for their marketing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| Mr. Seymour, you're projecting the signage on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| Do you have specifications for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| I mean, he mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| I guess I want to go back and reiterate that the design changes that you're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| and conceding to this machine, they've asked for additional landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| Is this a deviation from your standard landscape plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| And then talk about what your sign requirements are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| Is it going to have a pole sign or just on the facade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Pole signs are not allowed in this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| There will be a wall sign and a directional sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| and those will be the only signs allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| And so would you say the landscape plan is a deviation from your standard plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| Tim, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| They typically meet whatever the zoning ordinance calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| And this does meet the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| and the evergreen trees are in response to the Seven Springs request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5251)|
| 1:27:38| So those came as recommendations from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| and those will be adhered to in your plans you submit and plans that get installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| Actually, the landscaping is more in response to the request of the Seven Springs neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5266)|
| 1:27:54| So you've assured them that those things will be done based on what you've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| Mr. Shod's here, and he will sign off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Under the current zoning, what is the current zoning exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| RP1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| And what all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| I mean, I've got zero problem with Dollar General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| and I just wonder what all are the uses that could go into this commercial neighborhood zone area without a use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5298)|
| 1:28:25| Without a use on review, there is no commercial use in the RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| But under the RP1 zone, an applicant or a property owner has the right to request up to one acre of commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5310)|
| 1:28:39| based on per 100 units in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| The guiding, what guides the uses of the commercial area once they ask for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5324)|
| 1:28:51| are the uses that are permitted in the neighborhood shopping center district, SC1 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| Those uses that are permitted in SC1 would be permitted in this type of facility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| I want to point out that in 1995, shortly after this property was rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| the same applicant or the Shod family did receive approval of a development plan at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| that would have permitted over 20,000 square feet of commercial use at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5353)|
| 1:29:21| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| I've got a second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| I don't know how this relates to the rules, but if someone else on the opposition wanted to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| how would we go about doing that if I wanted to request that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| Someone who is opposed to the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| Yeah, there's someone else from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| I mean, well, wants to support the appeal that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| Someone that supports the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| Yeah, that's in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| Have they had the opportunity to have up to three speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| Well, have there been three speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| Can we do that right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| I mean, can I call somebody up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| We've had one speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| That's why I'm asking just the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| Request this has been the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| You can amend the rules to do it out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Make a motion to amend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| Okay, yeah, I'd like to make a motion to amend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| There's someone who wants to speak that lives in a nearby neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| I'd like to give him a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Okay, this is a motion to amend the rules to allow a speaker, second speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| Okay, so who is that speaker then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| He's coming to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| Sir, please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| Yes, I appreciate the time you've given me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Jason Mann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| I live at 6040 Tennyson Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| I just wanted to point out one brief thing about water quality in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| I know water quality speaks to a lot of folks in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| and you've got some runoff reduction stuff coming down the pike here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| but I wanted to talk about water quality in Ten Mile Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| This is at the absolute headwaters of Ten Mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| There's a few springheads located just upstream of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| but the increase in impervious area in this watershed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| will drastically increase the urbanized effects of Ten Mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| and my watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| Ten Mile Creek follows along the back property line that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| and it is deeply incised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| We've got folks mowing up to the banks and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| I don't want to name names or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| but severe water quality impacts from the urbanization in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| If you were to increase impervious land in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| you are going to have increased problems with a lot of the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| downstream from there, including a lot of the culverts in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| and downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| A lot of things are undersized down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| The county and city boundary meanders back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| along Amherst and Piney Grove, so you've got to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| While I do have the remaining time, I do want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| the connectivity is absolutely ridiculous for this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| The windy roads are deathly scary to both my 69-year-old mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| who lives in the area, and my wife, who's driving with my two kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| down 14-foot wide lanes with drastic windy curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| A few minutes to I-75, a few minutes to 40, a few minutes to Western at 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| Good luck to these 18-wheelers getting in and out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| If you have a single entrance and egress for this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| you're going to have some serious problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| When coal's at its peak demand, that train is running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| a lot more than 10 to 15 times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| It keeps me up at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| But I just want to point out that traffic is absolutely stopped, gridlocked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| at this intersection, and I think that having a commercial activity there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| is a big mistake for my property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| Anyway, thank you so much for Councilman Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| Appreciate you all amending the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Again, Jason Mann, thank you so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| Thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| I'd like to point out that on the opposite corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| from where this proposed Dollar General would go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| the land is also commercially zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| It's a bigger parcel of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| It would be sized to possibly accommodate a convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| with the items that one would typically find at a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| So this is a neighborhood commercial zone to provide a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| for people who live not only at the Seven Springs neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| but throughout that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| I believe the lady wanted to make one additional comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| If we could let her do that, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| If she wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| What's your comment or question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| No. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| She said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| So at this point we do not have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Is that correct, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| I'll make that motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| Motion to approve the appeal of Miss Doherty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| There is no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| I'll second it just so we can have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| I think we know what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| Okay, so there is a motion and a second to approve the appeal of Miss Doherty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| which is to deny the Dollar General store is basically what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| Okay, so all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| Okay, vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Okay, this is if you support Miss Doherty, you vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| You're approving the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Okay, so all in favor of supporting Miss Doherty's appeal say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5680)|
| 1:34:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Okay, those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| Okay, first of all we're going to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| Okay, just to be simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Okay, if you support Miss Doherty, you vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| If you support Dollar General being built, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| Aye for Miss Doherty, no for Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| I'm sorry, Councilman Stanton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| Well, Mayor, just to state my position on this, I actually have a lot of sympathy for the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5714)|
| 1:35:21| I'm not necessarily a huge fan of Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| But I saw this as a zoning issue and it seemed like this was appropriate for commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5725)|
| 1:35:35| So I will not be supporting the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| But I just wanted to be clear that I'm not, I don't see it as a vote in support of more Dollar Generals or Dollar General in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5738)|
| 1:35:49| But just to clarify my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| General Dollar, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Can we do a vote on Dollar General stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| Okay, so again, vote aye if you support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| I'm sorry, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| Yes, I was over there and I know that it's a winding road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| It's very close to that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| However, I don't have any problems with the Dollar General located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| And people may be glad at some point that there's something close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| Because once you leave Middlebrook Pike, you're not going to find very much for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| So I'm going to be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| No? You're going to vote no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| I'll make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| I am voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| Now let's call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=5805)|

| 1:40:44| And then I think it's safe to point out this does come with a federal, come by a federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6044)|

| 1:41:25| I don't know whether Jim Hagerman or Bob Wetzel is the right person, but it seemed to me like a lot of money to inspect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6085)|
| 1:41:31| construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| We have in-house inspection folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| So I'm wondering, A, why so much to do inspection and why use an outsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| And, B, are we being reimbursed at all by the developer for this expenditure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| The good news on this is the reason we're having to hire outside help is we have so much development going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6107)|
| 1:41:52| We went over these projects with our engineering department over a year ago, how we're going to manage this flow of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| activity, and they wanted to get some outside help to help them manage these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| This is based on an 18-month project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| We think the project will be done in less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| So the number should be absolutely less than this number, but you don't know that until you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| It's a not to exceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| It's a not to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| That's the ceiling you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| It is a not to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| And also the project is capped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| This is a South Waterfront TIF project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| And so there is a 2.5 public allocation that goes for both the construction and the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| So this is going to be, it's a capped expense at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| And the last part of the question was, does the developer reimburse us for any of the inspection services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| The money for this is, he's building public right-of-way here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| This is building the public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| This is the stuff that serves the buildings he wants to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| The South Waterfront Vision Plan requests that in this particular area we're going to move the road 20-some feet south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6170)|
| 1:42:58| We're going to build a 20-foot river walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| There's going to be a public road off of this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| So this will all be inspected at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| So there's roads and utilities and that kind of stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| Roads, utilities, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| All the utilities will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| They will be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| They'll be underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| The overhead will go underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| So this is the first implementation of the vision plan to any large scale at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| I might mention while we're here, we've had several discussions with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| There will require some street closures on this as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6202)|
| 1:43:26| Our engineering department is still negotiating that with the developer to make sure we minimize the impact on the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6206)|
| 1:43:32| but it's also a project that's going to require some road closure time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6217)|

| 1:44:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6266)|

| 1:44:32| 12-D is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Appendix B, zoning regulations regarding pet services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6272)|
| 1:44:40| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| Okay, we have one person signed up to speak against this, Ms. Carlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| And Ms. Malone, please state your name and address for the record and I'm going to start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6286)|
| 1:44:53| 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| Carlene Malone on behalf of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| We're not opposed to pet services and we're not opposed to pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| If you read the MPC transcript, it's all about how much we all love our pets and we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6305)|
| 1:45:14| What's important here is the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| We want to make sure, first of all, that it is enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| that you can tell the difference between a kennel and a doggy day spa or indoor whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6321)|
| 1:45:28| The other thing, and this is vital to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| whatever the owners, residents of C2, which is my understanding of where this request began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6331)|
| 1:45:40| whatever they want in C2, fine with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| Our concern is C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| C1 is a restricted neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| It pretty much exists in six or seven places in all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| It is the old, spontaneous, small commercial areas that are in the middle of older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6356)|
| 1:46:04| There's one, for instance, the Smithwood Corner on Tassel Pike across from the Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6364)|
| 1:46:11| We want to be protective of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| And let me point this out and it's a little bit interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| The newer zones, town center development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6379)|
| 1:46:25| which has almost exactly the same limitation on uses as the C1 neighborhood commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6385)|
| 1:46:34| this is not going to be granted to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| even though the uses are almost verbatim in both of those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| We think that's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Please understand what's being proposed is not just grooming, but it's socializing animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| it is training animals, it is daycare, it is all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| There is no requirement, no standards whatsoever for indoor pet uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| Veterinarians, for instance, are required in our zoning ordinance to have soundproofing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| This does not even require soundproofing and we're talking in the C1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| where it can literally be 20 feet from a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| So our request is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| We want to make sure that the city believes it is enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| and can be distinguished between a kennel or some other animal thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| We want you to understand that what's being proposed for indoors has no standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| and it allows pet shops, training, daycare, all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| It's not just grooming a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| And above all else, we ask that it be deleted from the C1 zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| Thank you, Ms. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| I have some concerns about this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| and probably my biggest concern is this is a solution looking for a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| I'm not sure that we have this big outpouring of requests for this particular zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6479)|
| 1:48:05| and I'm concerned many of the things that Ms. Malone brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| and I don't think Ms. Malone from this, but I also share some of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| And I really think that this is probably not something that we need to approve tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6496)|
| 1:48:24| I think that we need to work with, we need to think about what we want this to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6504)|
| 1:48:30| if there is a problem that demands this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| and then to look at some other possible restrictions on this particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6513)|
| 1:48:39| I would not particularly like to have a doggy daycare next door to my house, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6519)|
| 1:48:46| and that could be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| Hopefully not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| I don't think the people who were here earlier from the Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| would be real thrilled with this on that parcel of land either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| I'm inclined to woof, but right now I just wanted to ask a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| One is, and if Ms. Malone is there, if I could ask her a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6545)|
| 1:49:10| If we take it out of C1, which is the close-in neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6550)|
| 1:49:15| that solves one type of problem, proximity in an area maybe where it doesn't belong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| or at least there's a nice question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| You mentioned there are no standards for these indoor pet uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| Where would we find the standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Are there any that you would propose, or has MPC just not come up with a list that helps us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| MPC has not come up with any standards for indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| They have standards for outdoor, which involves planting trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| and it's outdoor for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| So if you had outdoor pet training, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6585)|
| 1:49:52| But one of the things to remember is some of the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| that are being recommended for indoor pet services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| are presently uses that are only allowed in C3 and C4 zones at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| So we're talking a big jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| And again, with veterinarians in C3, they have to have soundproofing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| So we're talking not a small little thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| I think what Councilwoman Palmer is talking about, she understands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| They're not small little things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| These are big differences in what we're going to allow in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| The other thing is, when you have a definition of a kennel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| which is, I think, four or five dogs over six months of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| how do you tell the difference between this, doggy daycare, and a kennel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6632)|
| 1:50:40| You know, the language is more than four or more than five dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| over six months of age being kept on a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| I'm not sure I understand what kept on a property means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| And kennels are not allowed in C1 or C2 or C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| You've got to be in C4 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| So, you know, we just want to know that things are clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| and we want it out of C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| It's just an inappropriate zone for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| And I tend to agree with Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| We need to really discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Sir, are you here to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| Okay, what is your name, and are you here to speak for or against this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| I am actually for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| My name is Everett Ivey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| The address is 1112 Calloway Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| Councilman, he wasn't signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| If it's without objection, I'll let him speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| Okay, go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| I'm going to start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| First of all, I want to clarify the services that are going to be offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6697)|
| 1:51:43| In a doggy day spa situation, what I plan to do is basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| for those dogs that have separation anxiety from their owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| I am submitting a place for them to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| so that they do not chew the condos and apartments and homes of the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| And they would come here and socialize with other animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| socialize with me and the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| There will be grooming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| There will be pet behavioralist specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| I am currently attending school to do pet aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| There's going to be skin care issues that are going to be addressed for the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| There's a growing need for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| I am a licensed esthetician and do skin care for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| but I am changing that and doing it for the pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| There isn't going to be any boarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| There is not going to be any dogs after 6 o'clock in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| So all of this rhetoric about the barking and all of the noising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| and all of this should be deflated now because after 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| the dogs will be with their owners, you know, doing their owner thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| This is only going to be a doggy day spa for during the daytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| There isn't going to be any need for any kind of boarding or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| This is just pet walking services, grooming services, the pet esthetician services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| and for the separation anxiety dogs, there's going to be the doggy day spa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| And as I said, that is going to end at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| I'm going to run it 6 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| And then after everybody gets off from work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| they're to come and pick their dogs up to go to their condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| apartments, homes, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| This is a great need for the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| We have the new doggy day park that is provided for the dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| There is a growing number of revitalization for the I-1 section to be turned into condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6817)|
| 1:53:46| There is new condominiums that are being built as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| There are lots of renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| All these condominiums means that there's going to be even more dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| than there already is in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| This need is very great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| The city FIDO people, I have talked with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| and every single person that walks through their door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6845)|
| 1:54:09| the one thing that they need and want most of all is grooming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| and other services that they do not offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| And so I'm going to be that person that offers these other services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| Is there any other questions or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| We'll just stay close in case there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| I'm a little concerned over the fact about the C-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| I have concerns over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| I have similar concerns that Ms. Palmer has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| And the real concern I have is the fact of really what the standards are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| and how detailed and how we have put those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6886)|
| 1:54:49| And so I am concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| I'd also like to address the fact that what we're looking at is we're looking at an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| for the entire city, not just the downtown or not just yours as a business that you hope to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| If we pass this, then this can happen wherever there's a C-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| and maybe we won't have the standards if we pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| So I would really recommend that we send this back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| and really have a good understanding of what the standards are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| and really take a second look at the C-1, as Ms. Malone has pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| So do I need to make that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| Well, let's just make a motion to take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| I make a motion we take it out of C-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| Make a motion to approve it and eliminate it from C-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| Well, the only problem I have with that is I agree with taking it out of C-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| but I also think that we really need to have the standards set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| And apparently that's what we're missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| So it will come back to us on a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| I'd like to just actually your counselor would like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| I want to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| This process, and I never spoke to the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| but this process began when Mayor Brown contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| He said he had a constituent who was interested in opening a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| like is being described in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| I've never spoken to the last gentleman who just spoke here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| but it sounds like he's the person who contacted Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| And Mayor Brown and I before the meeting today were talking about this over the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| hoping this individual would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| In order to accomplish, to try to move this on down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| I prepared a resolution asking MPC to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| The purpose of the resolution was to ask MPC to look at it in the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| but it was perhaps a little ambiguous where the then-leadership of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| decided to look at this on a city-wide basis rather than a downtown-only basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7011)|
| 1:57:00| So if there was any Scrivener's error on my part, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7020)|
| 1:57:04| But when Mayor Brown asked me to prepare it, it was to look at doing this in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7024)|
| 1:57:12| I wanted to bring that to council's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| Okay, but then I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| That we send it back to MPC for review of the C-1 and for more stringent standards to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7038)|
| 1:57:25| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| That's fine. You're just going to send stuff to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| I mean, you don't have a chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| I mean, we're going to get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| I mean, you're going to go down there six or nine months before it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| I mean, if you only want it in C-2, then let's vote it in C-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| and work that stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| Otherwise, it's going to get lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| I mean, that's why it did come as a recommendation to get it downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| You've got a lot of dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7070)|
| 1:57:51| You've got new apartments coming downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| I mean, right the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| That was really my deal to be in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7076)|
| 1:58:02| Councilman Delavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| Yeah, just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| I mean, I can appreciate what's being said now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| and that is that it was suggested that this occur as a more limited use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| in the downtown area where you don't have backyards and stuff that the dogs can run and play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7095)|
| 1:58:22| and so you can drop your dog off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| He talked about 12 hours a day from 6 to 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| MPC has 18 hours a day, and I don't know where they got that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| But, I mean, the duration, a 12-hour day strikes you as less of a kennel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| and leaving your dog and going out of town and just kind of a convenience for workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| So the time of day I think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| I think we should have some standards that they don't seem to be that exotic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| Should there be soundproofing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| Should there be a few other things that protect neighbors nearby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| who don't want to be sort of imposed on by a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7135)|
| 1:59:02| I kind of wonder if MPC didn't pick up on that when they got the referral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| It would be helpful for them to list control standards that protect adjoining owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7147)|
| 1:59:14| Maybe we can start, since this started as a downtown thing, with a central business district zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7154)|
| 1:59:20| and if it takes off and is wonderful, we can expand it to other zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| but why not use that as kind of a testing ground for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| That would have resolved the C1 issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| but I don't know whether we're the ones to set the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| or whether we should refer back for a list of standards that would be appropriate to protect neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| I don't think it should take a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| If it's soundproofing, if it's some other standard, we should get those in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| It sounds like an interesting idea and one that may be needed for downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7187)|
| 1:59:52| because you don't have the luxury of the backyard where the dog can run and play while you're at work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| So I would send it back, I guess, with directions to come up with standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| and to try it on a limited basis in C2 central business district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| and then we'll go from there as it expands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| Councilman Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| I just wanted to say, Councilman Wallace, we do have an acting director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| and interim director as far as MPC goes, so that shouldn't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7216)|
| 2:00:20| Hopefully MPC is still running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| He just got it did in November of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| It's like they obviously didn't think it was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| But I think I made a motion and I thought I heard a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7239)|
| 2:00:40| Although Councilman Greaves stole my thunder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| I do hope that we do have an interim director who is directing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| and the MPC is not sitting on its hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| I don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7250)|
| 2:00:53| I share you, Mr. Kelly, and the interim director and the staff are still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| Believe me, I can vouch for that in the last five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| Since Mr. Ivey originally contacted me about this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7263)|
| 2:01:10| and it seems it's taken on a life of its own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| but I don't think it's going to get lost in MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| Even though we don't have a director right now, we should have one sometime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| Basically, this man had what I thought was a pretty good business idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7283)|
| 2:01:29| and he wanted some help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| However, originally I was thinking mainly of downtown only, but we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| So that's why I'm supporting Councilman Greaves' motion to send it back to MPC for further study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7298)|
| 2:01:46| so that we can come to a good conclusion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| Mr. Kelly, did you want to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| Well, if you do refer it back, I believe we can get something back to you probably in April sometime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| but probably based on the timing of the planning commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7319)|
| 2:02:02| and public notice requirements and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| I think we can probably get something back to you in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| Certainly not any later than May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| So the motion is to send back to MPC and what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| To review C1 and more stringent standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7338)|
| 2:02:24| Is that the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7344)|
| 2:02:25| Developed standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| Developed standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| So are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| I take that motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7353)|
| 2:02:49| Can we take a quick break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| I was going to say, is that the first order of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| Generally two hours, we do take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| We have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| Do we have people in public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| Why don't we go ahead and take a, it's 9.04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| Why don't we reconvene at 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| 9.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| Well, 9.15, let's say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7391)|
| 2:03:15| That's too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| That's too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Let's take a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| 9.12, you all be back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| We're starting at 9.12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| Is there a motion to change that at the starting time or city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7403)|
| 2:03:30| 12A is an ordinance to set and fix the salary of the mayor of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| Requested by Vice Mayor Pavlis and council members Palmer, Campin, Wallace, and Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7414)|
| 2:03:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| Obviously, I'm going to chair the meeting from this point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| Just have this and then one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| But, you know, I wanted to bring this forward for a lot of different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7430)|
| 2:03:57| And if you all just allow me, I'll get through this as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| So what I'm proposing is that we raise the salary of the seat of the mayor from $130,000 to $142,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7442)|
| 2:04:13| which is a $12,500 increase for the seat of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7453)|
| 2:04:20| So, you know, why now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| I think that's a very fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| And there's quite a few reasons that I think that it's a good time to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7465)|
| 2:04:29| And the first reason for that, it's been nine years since we last adjusted the salary of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7469)|
| 2:04:38| And Mr. Frost and I, we spoke about a lot of different things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7478)|
| 2:04:45| And one thing that I didn't realize that I realize now is that if we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| the only time that you can adjust the salary of the mayor is after council races, which obviously is this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7489)|
| 2:04:58| So we would have to wait two more years if we didn't address it now, which would, you know, put it out 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7498)|
| 2:05:04| And we've discussed that, you know, how that affects our employees, you know, the mayor's employees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7504)|
| 2:05:11| When we did the, you know, the studies and what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| and we decided as a group or the majority of the group to, you know, to go ahead and implement the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7513)|
| 2:05:21| the raises a lot quicker than normal, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7521)|
| 2:05:27| So if we don't do it now, the gap continues to widen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7527)|
| 2:05:32| Another reason, too, is the, you can start picking up qualifying papers to run for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7532)|
| 2:05:39| I would assume they would all be in conjunction, the mayor's seat and the council's seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| but most importantly for the mayor's seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| Because I think if someone is out there teetering, if they're on the fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| that everything needs to be out there or as much as possible transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| and obvious to everybody as to what a salary would be, what benefits would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| and just everything that would be involved in running for mayor and if you were elected as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| So I think that that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| But, you know, most importantly, again, I just want people to realize this is not about the mayor that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7566)|
| 2:06:13| This is about the seat of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| So I want to emphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150120?start=7575)|
