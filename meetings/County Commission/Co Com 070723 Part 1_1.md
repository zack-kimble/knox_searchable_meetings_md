| 2:36:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| Just don't do anything and it will keep you out of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| But, Mr. Law Director, then it is up to this body to make the necessary adjustments to our ethics policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9392)|
| 2:36:44| to give it some teeth, to give the Ethics Commission guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9404)|
| 2:36:50| So why don't we, as a commission, come up with a committee to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9410)|
| 2:36:58| Instead of putting it on the Ethics Commission where they, you so eloquently pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9418)|
| 2:37:04| that they don't have the power to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9424)|
| 2:37:06| This is our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| Then why don't commission have, Mr. Chairman, you can appoint, we can vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9428)|
| 2:37:12| whatever we want to do is put some people in a committee to study what's being done around the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9432)|
| 2:37:18| to go look at it, and then bring it back to the Ethics Commission or bring it back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9438)|
| 2:37:23| If that's a motion, I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| So if we're charged to do it, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| This is not easy decisions we have to make, and that's why we make the big bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9451)|
| 2:37:35| So let's earn them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9458)|
| 2:37:39| And I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9459)|
| 2:37:40| Mr. Law Director, did we not accept the state's ethics committee laws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9460)|
| 2:37:49| What we did, we adopted the policy that was the model policy that CTAS came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9469)|
| 2:37:56| That's what we did, which is now on file with the Secretary of State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9476)|
| 2:38:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| But this would be a completely separate body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| This would be the ethics policy committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9489)|
| 2:38:14| Would this be a subcommittee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| That would satisfy me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| The main thing I don't want is I don't want to have a body come up with policy and also enforce the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9498)|
| 2:38:26| It would satisfy me if we had two separate committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9506)|
| 2:38:31| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:32| Just very briefly, you already have a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| and their law director has already said by passing this resolution you give them the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9514)|
| 2:38:39| These are people that you've already selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9523)|
| 2:38:44| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| Sometimes you need your friends to tell you what's wrong or your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9526)|
| 2:38:53| or your wife to tell you that tie doesn't work at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9533)|
| 2:38:57| You need outsiders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| We have a committee that has two commissioners on it and some outsiders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:04| All we're asking them to do is make a recommendation, series of recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9544)|
| 2:39:09| that we are free to ignore or change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| I know that, Commissioner Lambert, you're hung up on this idea about enforcement and making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9554)|
| 2:39:19| Again, we do this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9559)|
| 2:39:22| The federal government has committees that recommend judges pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| and they don't automatically go into force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| They have to be voted on by Congress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9568)|
| 2:39:29| This is merely a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:32| Let's go back to Commissioner Hammond's original motion and just take a straight up or down vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9572)|
| 2:39:36| What do you have against creating another committee, and we could have another committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9576)|
| 2:39:40| Because we don't need two committees, Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9580)|
| 2:39:42| We could have another committee that doesn't have a single person serving in government on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9582)|
| 2:39:47| We could have a real committee of citizens and not politicos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9587)|
| 2:39:52| We could have a committee without anybody that's elected on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9592)|
| 2:39:57| What would be the matter with having a real committee of average citizens making recommendations for the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9597)|
| 2:40:04| rather than going back to this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9604)|
| 2:40:06| Because we're playing a shell game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| And this committee, by the way, there are politicos on this committee that have access to grind with individuals that are being petty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9608)|
| 2:40:15| I know there's one man that we would not appoint him to the Industrial Development Board because of nepotism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9615)|
| 2:40:22| because his son was on the city's Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9622)|
| 2:40:27| and that gentleman has done nothing but criticize this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| Now, I don't think he's taken his charge seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| and I don't think that he's being impartial when every word that he says in the paper is against this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9634)|
| 2:40:41| I think that if we're going to have somebody advise us on ethical policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9641)|
| 2:40:47| that it needs to be a clean, independent group, not a group of politicos with access to ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9647)|
| 2:40:53| I think we need citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9653)|
| 2:40:54| And I think we know by now that politics is what the other guys do and honest public policy is what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9654)|
| 2:41:00| That's everybody's definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9660)|
| 2:41:02| So let's get real about this, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9662)|
| 2:41:04| We have a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9664)|
| 2:41:05| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9665)|
| 2:41:06| Let it make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| And by all means, let's stop the personal attacks on the members of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| Let's just argue about what the best policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| We're disengaged in some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| I just pointed out that there have been personal attacks against this body made by a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| That is bringing it to the attention of folks that this ethics committee is not of snow white folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9684)|
| 2:41:32| There's people out there with political access to ground, and it's as political as anything in this government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9692)|
| 2:41:37| And if we're going to have someone recommend a policy, let's get a new committee, an independent committee of all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9697)|
| 2:41:43| I was snow white once, but I drifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| And let me just say we all have drifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9706)|
| 2:41:49| Let us just put this group of citizens, let's give them the opportunity to do their work, and let's evaluate their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9709)|
| 2:41:55| Let's return to the original motion and pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9717)|
| 2:41:58| Let's get ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9718)|
| 2:41:59| I think we're all ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9719)|
| 2:42:00| We're on a substitute motion, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| Would you repeat the motion again, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| Commissioner Trammell's substitute motion is to create a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9724)|
| 2:42:09| Lee, go ahead and tell us how you want it set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| It's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9733)|
| 2:42:14| How many members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| I was just asking simply if that's what you were trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| So I want to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:19| I think what you would need to do, though, is you'd need to come up with a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9739)|
| 2:42:24| A committee of five from this body to bring to the full body clarification on our ethics policy, teeth and enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9744)|
| 2:42:37| rules and regulations to be followed by all Knox County employees and elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9757)|
| 2:42:42| And how would the committee be set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| I mean, who's going to pick the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| Mr. Chairman, that's your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9767)|
| 2:42:55| Commissioner, can you second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9777)|
| 2:42:59| I mean, I thought you made the second when he made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9779)|
| 2:43:04| Well, no, I mean, if this one fails, I've got another motion to bring that we do a body of no elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9784)|
| 2:43:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| Five from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9794)|
| 2:43:15| Five from this body is what Commissioner Trammell's motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9795)|
| 2:43:20| And I guess we need to do roll call starting in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| A vote yes would mean we would appoint a new committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:30| A vote no would mean we go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9810)|
| 2:43:34| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9814)|
| 2:43:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9815)|

| 2:43:45| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| I was reminded of a great commissioner once that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9827)|
| 2:43:51| This isn't Candyland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9831)|
| 2:43:54| You don't like it, start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9834)|
| 2:43:55| So I vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9839)|

| 2:44:09| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9849)|

| 2:44:12| Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070723part1?start=9852)|
