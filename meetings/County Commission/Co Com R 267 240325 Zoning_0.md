| 0:02:47| Seeing none, Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=167)|

| 0:02:53| because it's consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| The F Floodway zone will be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=176)|

| 0:03:04| No, I just wanted to say I just wanted my brother over there to help me because my husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| passed away, and I've just about killed myself taking care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| So that's the reason we want him over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=198)|

| 0:04:08| the street name of Old Tazewell Pike to Memory Hill Lane between Murphy Road and a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| 70 feet north of the southeast corner of parcel 039257.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=253)|

| 0:04:26| The applicant is Knox Planning, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Would you please read your recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the name change from Old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| Tazewell Pike to Corinth Church Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Is there any opposition to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| Seeing none, any comments, Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=288)|

| 0:04:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| This is a little not quite as simple as it looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| As you can see, there was a request and recommendation by the planning staff for one name, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=303)|
| 0:05:12| Planning Commission voted for another name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| I'm a little bit torn, and I'll explain what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| I'm a little bit torn here because this is, you guys hopefully will remember the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| of Old Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| We debated that for a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| The part of Old Tazewell Pike that is essentially been rerouted into this new neighborhood is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| what's being renamed because it doesn't really make sense to call it Old Tazewell Pike anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| So Planning, and Ms. Brooks, feel free to jump in if I misstate anything here, but Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| reached out to the residents on this new street and gave them some options as to what name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=348)|
| 0:05:57| they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| These two names were among the choices, and the residents voted, I believe, four to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| in favor of Memory Hill Lane, and so that was the recommendation of the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| Subsequently, at the Planning Commission meeting, those residents didn't come because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| they thought they had made their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| There were some folks in the area that expressed the opinion that it should be called Corinth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=379)|
| 0:06:27| Church Lane because the church that sits on Old Tazewell Pike was originally called Corinth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=387)|
| 0:06:36| United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| It isn't called that anymore, but I think the thought was that it better reflected the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| history of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| I'm all about that too, and I grew up in that area, remember it being Corinth Church, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| at the same time, it's not that anymore, and the people that live on this road are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| to live there for, you know, however many number of years, and who knows, maybe for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| a long time, and I don't mean to offend anybody, but I'm a pastor who believes in an advancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=425)|

| 0:12:11| Since there's so much traffic on Pettigo, is there any plans for the county to widen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| that road or do anything to alleviate some of that traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=737)|

| 0:21:55| that when we discuss road improvements, including widening, guardrails, rumble strips, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1315)|

| 0:27:05| What our development is intending to do is actually take advantage of that prior disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| and put our development basically in that area, so we're really not disturbing any additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| land other than that area, and we may need to realign along the frontage with the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1638)|

| 0:30:27| Yes, and I'm glad that that image that's up in front, that's the most appropriate image| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| You can see, I mean, there's a TVA easement that bisects the property and you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| the southern limit of that disturbance from that prior borrow pit and that condition basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| draws a line along the south and all of our, you know, development would be north of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| and again, then the concept plan that we submitted with our traffic impact analysis, it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| you know, the footprint would fit very neatly in that patch of exposed earth and this gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| to, you know, the issue with this development is we are asking for an extension of three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| dwelling units per acre and this is in the rural area under our current growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1872)|

| 0:31:18| The first criteria is it needs to be zoned P.R., which is why we're here and Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| Staff and Planning Commission agree that it should be zoned Planned Residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| in a property like this with, you know, the environmental constraints, there is hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| there, there's a TVA easement, it just makes sense to give you the flexibility to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| to cluster the development that the P.R. allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| The second is that water, sewer, and utilities are available and there's no question this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| property is served and has capacity for water, sewer, and the utilities at this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| The third is the road access and that's the reason we had a traffic impact analysis to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| study what the potential impacts from our development would be on High School Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| you know, from the location of this property to the south on Copeland where it intersects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| and that's where the planned growth area starts and also keeping in mind what other developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| have been in place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| And our traffic impact analysis looked at that and said, you know, the road can handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| the additional trips from a development that's 2.98 dwelling units an acre, which is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| we are proposing just a little south of 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| So it meets all the criteria of the current growth policy plan for extensions of the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1947)|
| 0:32:35| of the 3 units an acre in the rural area and I understand we are in the process of amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| that growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| This body has approved it contingent upon, you know, the comprehensive land and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1962)|
| 0:32:51| plan being approved and we're also waiting for Farragut to decide whether they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| to vote in favor of the growth policy plan or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| I do want to point out that in the history of growth policy plans, the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| has never voted to approve one yet, but we're hopeful they will this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| But all that said, we're dealing with the current plan in place and while we are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| very hopeful that the new growth policy plan will pass, the current plan does allow this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| extension for this additional density and, you know, I think even though it's still in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| the rural area and this property should be in the rural area, you know, this is a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| unique piece of property because of its prior use, because of the prior disturbance, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| not creating any type of real precedent for, you know, extensions, additional extensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| into the rural area that doesn't have a piece of property that's already been disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| like this one has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| If we're wanting to preserve the rural character, the rural character of this property has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| been disturbed and so that makes it a very unique circumstance to discuss and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| why Planning Commission, and if you listen to their conversations about that, they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| convinced that the extension to 3 dwelling units an acre would be proper because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| prior disturbance and the ability to utilize that for a very nice, very affordable development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| So I would ask that you follow Planning Commission's unanimous recommendation and approve PR at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| 3 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2052)|

| 0:34:17| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Mullins, if this rezoning goes through, you have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| to put 100 units on this property, so are you telling me that the tan area up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| the pit, is where you're going to put the 100 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Absolutely. It would be 103 units and if you look at my letter on page 4, and it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| in the traffic impact analysis, there is a proposed concept plan showing those 103 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2078)|
| 0:34:46| right in that area, that disturbed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| Okay. Okay. And just for the record, I believe in January of 2001, the Town of Farragut did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| vote for the growth plan when it was initially adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| I'm sorry, I may have been incorrect on that. I thought it had to go through the mediation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| process in the state first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| And I could be too. 2001 was well before I was paying attention to these sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2108)|
| 0:35:16| Thank you. Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to point out the blue line stream at the front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2121)|

| 0:35:31| Absolutely. Absolutely. And that's, again, why the PR is appropriate, because it allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| us to avoid that. And of course, the blue line stream isn't in that borrow pit area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| It's away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2141)|

| 0:36:02| And because the area is already disturbed, that kind of changes the situation a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| bit. And also looking at the daily vehicle trips, the capacity is there on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2168)|

| 0:37:55| All right. I will give each of you five minutes to address this. The applicant will have five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2275)|

| 0:38:10| Thank you, Madam Chair. This is about 56.4 acres just south of Kingston Pike. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2290)|

| 0:38:27| some time. At one time, I think it was going to be Phase II of Briar Glen, which is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| you see, if you go back up, you will see some stub outs from Briar Glen into the back portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| of that property, which is already zoned primarily planned residential. I am not sure what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| density was when they zoned planned residential. The density did not seem to be assigned to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2328)|

| 0:39:02| zoned planned commercial. We are asking to extend that office zoning down into the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2342)|

| 0:39:14| current zoning. We are then asking to take that from planned commercial, which can allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| some pretty intensive uses, to the OB zoning, which allows office business park uses, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2360)|

| 0:39:39| to develop this as some apartments. We have Mr. Murphy, who developed the apartments down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2379)|

| 0:40:06| recommended five units an acre, Planning Commission voted unanimously for five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| but we are okay with four units an acre on the density, as long as we can get at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| the four units. Now, we have had quite a bit of neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2415)|

| 0:40:31| actually the Thursday of the snowpocalypse, and despite all of that, Mr. Snowden appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2431)|

| 0:40:49| Thank you. We did listen to their feedback, and we have talked to Mr. Kline, who is representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| both the neighborhoods for Briar Glen and for Suburban Hills, and we have talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| Commissioner Oster and understand that she has some conditions that she wishes to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| in place, which we are fine with. These have been something that we have discussed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| the neighbors and Mr. Kline. You know, four units an acre is one of the conditions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| can be imposed. The planned residential has a 35-foot peripheral setback. It can be reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| adjacent to other residential uses, but we are going to agree not to reduce that 35-peripheral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| setback adjacent to Briar Glen or Suburban Hills. Landscaping and buffering has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| a big deal, and we are going to plant six-foot green giants at 12,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2493)|

| 0:41:55| to go eight feet, and we have talked about if they want to increase that, you know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| they are willing to pitch in the difference, that we certainly could talk about that during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| the development plan phase. The biggest concern that I think all the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| had is they don't want our new traffic coming through their existing neighborhoods. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| know, and that was quite a bit of conversation at planning commissioners, several planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| commissioners that think, you know, that connectivity is something that they actually wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| have, but the neighbors have been very, very, very clear they don't want that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| Now, it would be convenient to be able to design a subdivision with those existing sub-outs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| in mind, but we are okay to respect their wishes and not connect through their neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2553)|

| 0:43:40| to announce our new address. I represent a Briar Glen subdivision and suburban hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2620)|

| 0:43:54| about as the conditions and the conditions that we have agreed to that you'll hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| Ms. Oster. So I'd like to ask you all, if you are here in support of those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| as we agreed upon to either raise your hand or stand up, wow. I have never seen an agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2647)|
| 0:44:18| upon condition supported by this number of people at county commission ever. And I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2658)|
| 0:44:26| been doing this 36 years, folks. Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. It's important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2666)|
| 0:44:35| understand why they're here. Number one, from the suburban hill standpoint and Briar Glen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| these stub outs that exist are not to be connected and everybody's agreed to it. And so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| asking you all to pair up with the neighborhood and the developer and not allow connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2688)|
| 0:44:56| through the subdivision onto these streets. It's important for the quality of life and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| we can talk further about it if need be. The second most important part is the landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2704)|

| 0:45:20| And it's important that we recognize his ability and willingness to continue to work with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2720)|
| 0:45:28| folks and these folks' persistence in working. Because we had many meetings, lots of phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| calls. Mr. Mullins and I have been on the phone more than we want to be with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| Mr. Smith has agreed to plant six foot tall green giant trees 12 feet apart. According| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2741)|

| 0:45:54| conditions associated with this development. The six foot green giants will be planted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| as close to three foot off their property line as allowed by site conditions. And neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2758)|
| 0:46:06| are allowed to pay the difference if they want to start out with an eight foot tall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| tree instead of a six foot tall tree. And the trees will be planted 12 foot off center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| So they will grow together. These are green giants. And what will happen, hopefully, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| that there will be a buffer, a landscape buffer, a natural buffer, so that between the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| developments, the ones existing now and the ones about to be developed, there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| a nice buffer. Aside from no connectivity and that landscape buffer, four dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2792)|
| 0:46:41| per acre has been agreed upon by all the parties. We would ask you to go ahead and approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| And Mr. Smith has agreed not to reduce the 35 foot peripheral setback adjacent to either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| Briar Glen or Suburban Hills. And with that, I'll turn it over to you all for your eminent wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2814)|

| 0:48:55| we received a ton of emails from all of you and bravo for that. And so if you didn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=2935)|

| 0:51:39| And I appreciate that. I doubt there's one commissioner that didn't get from Suburban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| Hills or Briar Glen or Hannah Place about no stub outs. But I want to also thank Scott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| Smith publicly, if you don't mind standing up. He's back there in the back. He attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| the meeting with 85 people. I'm going to correct you, Ben. And he didn't know what to expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| because when you're a developer in front of a whole lot of people, when there's a bunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| of land up for sale, you really don't know what to expect. And he answered the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3130)|
| 0:52:17| and he has met with me numerous times. And he's been really good to work with. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| want to thank him publicly for that. I want to thank Wayne. It's the first time that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3144)|

| 0:52:36| for Suburban Hills and Briar Glen as well. And as always, Ben's a pleasure to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| and always know that he sticks with what he says he's going to do. And he holds his applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| to the same, which is important. But really thank my constituents for being here, making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3171)|
| 0:52:59| your voice heard. And I'm just excited. This has been an exciting zoning. It's been stressful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3179)|
| 0:53:08| and it's been times you kind of didn't know which way we were going. But I knew in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3188)|

| 0:53:25| I've got a good amount of conditions on this motion. Excuse me. So I'm going to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3205)|

| 0:54:35| Thank you. Do we have a second? Second. Commissioner Oster, did you want to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3275)|
| 0:54:45| include a landscape plan? Yeah. I mean, I put the six foot green giants in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| but we can also do the landscape plan. We can add that also. Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| All right. Thank you. We have a proper motion on the floor for Ms. Oster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3298)|

| 0:57:45| for up to five dwelling units per acre. This rezoning is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| designation of low-density residential and as well as it is located within the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| growth area under the current growth policy plan. It's a smaller size track than you normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3476)|

| 0:58:11| With it being a smaller size, that makes density all the more important when you factor in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| the total cost of the development from the sense of the acquisition cost, the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3497)|

| 0:58:44| improvements that have happened over the last 10 years or so to Snyder Road. The preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| development for this development would be on Catlett Road. There were some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| about Catlett Road being suitable. I have spoken with Director Snowden with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3536)|

| 0:59:07| I know that is preferred from the developer and that is preferred from some of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| that we have seen from the community would be not to have access off Snyder. The additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| infrastructure improvements include, as I understand, there is going to be a new traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3559)|

| 1:01:02| are a little bit older homes. Snyder Road is not a great road. In fact, it is almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3662)|
| 1:01:13| a racetrack, to tell you the truth. I do appreciate the Catlett Road entrance. I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| that is something that would be preferable. Having said all that, I have told Mr. Forrester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3679)|
| 1:01:28| the best I feel like I can do on this is four per acre. It is a very small parcel. It lays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3688)|
| 1:01:37| reasonably well, but even at four per acre, it is going to take every available buildable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3697)|
| 1:01:47| place on it to make that happen. As much as I wish we could have come a little closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3707)|

| 1:02:36| So obviously five was a request, a smaller piece of property. I have discussed that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| could come up with my client. If we cannot get five, is there something less that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| can live with? Looking at the lot, looking at the way it lays and conceptually laying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| it out, I think if he could get 51 lots, he could make it work. Eleven and a half acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3774)|
| 1:03:02| it ends up being about five more total lots on the development. It does not get you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3782)|
| 1:03:11| necessarily four and a half, but it is just five more lots. I do not believe that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| make a substantial impact and traffic increase on the area, but would allow to absorb these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| costs and go forward with the development. Mr. Moyers, I have a question for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| If I make a motion for an exact number of lots, is that acceptable or do I have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| a per acreage? Density is done per acre, so you would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| to figure out what that would equate to in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| What is that? Math in public is around 4.4, 4.5, somewhere around there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3825)|
| 1:03:56| We have done maximum number of lots on Thunder Mountain properties up to total number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3836)|
| 1:04:08| lots. I do not recall that. Amy, is that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| that we do? Are we able to express this in terms of maximum number of units rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| density per acre? The commission has done that before, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| could probably do a little math here and also figure out volumes per acre as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| 4.6, 4.68. Substitute motion for 4.68 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3871)|
| 1:04:42| Second. We have a substitute motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| at 4.68 per acre by ward seconded by Jay. Is there any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3887)|
| 1:05:00| Commissioner Jay. Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| why I seconded the motion. Almost monthly, this commission says we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| more dense development in the area that there is already dense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| We want more infill in places that there is already more dense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| We want more units near major corridors. This fits every one of those criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| We are not going to have more affordable housing if we keep taking a prime example of the thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| we do want and making it harder and more expensive. It may only seem like a few other lots, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3932)|
| 1:05:41| that is the difference between maybe a $200,000 house and a $300,000 house, the way costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| are today. This is a prime example of exactly what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| ask for. This is not out in the rural areas. It is right in the heart of a bunch of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| neighborhoods with a bunch of other access. That is why I seconded the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| This is a great example of how we can help build more affordable housing by granting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| a higher density in a dense area. Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just had a question for Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| Catlett and Snyder, what are the widths of those roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| The width of Catlett, we looked at it today. It varies, but it is fairly consistent between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| 19 and 20. We kind of estimated that the average width from Catlett down to Gilbert would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| about 19.5 feet. Based on the standard values that you sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| me today, about an 18-19 width road, you are looking at 2,000 to 3,000 average daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| vehicle trips. That is the capacity of a road of that width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| I don't have that chart in front of me, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| We don't have a count on Catlett Drive, but we did have a count on Snyder, which obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| is the more main road. Snyder fell within that range, so I would assume this would too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| but we don't have a count on this location in particular, on Catlett Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| With the addition of 606 vehicle trips, are we pushing capacity on Catlett or Snyder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4025)|
| 1:07:13| Let me look at that chart again. I'm sorry, Commissioner. It's been a minute since I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| looked at that. Like I said, I don't disagree with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| Jay, but again, we are tasked with the responsibility of making sure that the roads that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4042)|
| 1:07:30| and the topography that we have to deal with, that we are not adding overcapacity to roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4050)|
| 1:07:38| based on the improvements that we can do or we can require the applicant to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4058)|
| 1:07:46| Widening a road only addresses safety. It does not address capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| We've really got to start looking at that. Everything that you read about doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| that means you have to reduce density in those areas, and so you've got to weigh that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4076)|
| 1:08:09| Thank you. Are there any other comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| Let's see. No lights. We have a substitute motion on the floor to approve this planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4091)|
| 1:08:19| residential zoning up to 4.68 per acre. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4099)|
| 1:08:31| Madam Chair? Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| Sorry about that. That 4.68 equals 51 lots. Make sure it equals 51 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4115)|
| 1:08:43| All right. Commissioner Stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4123)|
| 1:08:52| Madam Chair, I would like to clarify, there is some debate about the total acreage of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| The MPC staff report says one thing, the KGS owner card says another, and the deed is silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4137)|
| 1:09:06| So until a survey is done, we don't know. But I do think to be fair to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| if the thought is this commission wants 51 lots, it might be better to stick with a lot threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| in this case, rather than a density, because we don't know the exact density due to the acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| discrepancy. Just for your all's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| If Mr. Moyers is okay with it, then we'll do the 51 lots, if it's okay with the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| All right. So you're changing your substitute motion to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| For clarity, for 51 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| 51 lots on this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| And a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| And second approves. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| Any other questions? Seeing none, this is for 51 lots. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| Opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4198)|

| 1:11:14| Introduction of the applicant. Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street here for the applicant. Thank you. Is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4274)|
| 1:11:23| Seeing none, the planning recommendation, please. Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4283)|

| 1:11:37| Thank you. Mr. Mullins, would you like to speak to this? Yes. Thank you. As you know, this was deferred from last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| because there was conversation about the potential realignment of Sam Lee Road at the location of this property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| you know, we went back and we had more conversations with Director Snowden Engineering Public Works about what that could look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| especially not knowing what the property is there to the west when they may be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| Although a little bird told me that that Mr. Lowndes has actually filed a zoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| already and that will be coming down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| So we may get to work on that piece of property sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| But regardless, what we did is we tried to look at this and how can we make this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| without having to be dependent upon necessarily connecting to Mr. Lowndes' property. And I want to apologize, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| I know I did this privately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| but I want to apologize if we confused or didn't articulate something the way we should have and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| the entire project hadn't been really entitled, just the piece that we can offer with our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| And keep in mind that planning staff, because this is in the planned growth area and because this is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| with the sector plan of medium-density residential, they had recommended five dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| which is actually the upper limits of low-density residential, not medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| And we had accepted that recommendation at Planning Commission. They voted unanimously to approve it at five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| It was after that that this whole idea about working with Sam Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| the Sam Lee Road realignment came up. And we're happy to do that. We're happy to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| We've moved forward with several alternative concepts, ran them all through Hardin Valley Planning Advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| make sure they're okay because they gave us quite a bit of input about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| kind of what they are interested in in this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| And we think it's appropriate to move forward with the rezoning. In fact, the last concept I sent to you guys, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| it's just conceptual. It kind of reserves that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| lets us have our access with a driveway off of Sam Lee, has a space of continuing towards Mr. Lowness' property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| kind of reserved for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| use, and we don't have to solve that problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| but still allows us to have that access and have the rezoning. And that concept was for 42 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| which has always been the concepts we've had that have been between 39 and 42 dwelling units an acre is what we've always talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| If we had the full 10.74 acres, that would be, you know, four units an acre or a little bit 4.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| right around there. Not knowing exactly how much of that property is going to be taken up with any potential realignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| we estimate that a density of 4.5 units an acre would give us the flexibility to do our project the way we always envisioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| but also the county flexibility to utilize the southern portion of that property for some realignment of Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4459)|
| 1:14:26| And Mr. Clark spoke last week, and I know he's had some additional emails with his concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| You know, there's going to be additional, the Sam Lee Road will create a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| between his property and ours, and there'll have to be landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| with our development, and I'm sure that, you know, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| future road improvements, there may be landscaping along with those improvements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| But our detention is going to be basically in that little nook in that upper northwest corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| There's already a low spot. The water already runs there primarily, and we are intending to do, actually not detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| but kind of retention and make that a community amenity, sort of a, we hold the water, have a fountain feature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| and as you hold the water and that fountain aerates it, it deals with some of the the environmental and the bio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| concerns that Mr. Clark has expressed in some of his emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| So we, it's something that we can use an existing low spot where the water is already going and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| make that part of our development. And keep in mind that, you know, that the low spot is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| 1,350 feet from the pond that Mr. Clark's cows feed in, so we're still a good ways away, and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4527)|
| 1:15:38| the low end of our, the southern end of our property is about 1,106 feet, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| So we think that there's opportunity as we move forward with the development plan, as we'll have to, to have some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| you know, make sure that we're respectful to his property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| I did, Commissioner Frazier reached out to me and expressed her concerns about road capacity, and I'm glad she did so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| because it allowed me to do some homework before I came, and I'm sure you wanted to have an intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| conversation about that, so I really appreciate you giving me a heads up on on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| And so I reached out to Mr. Snowden on on the capacity, and he shared with me the same chart that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| he shared with you, and I did math and asked Mr. Director Snowden to confirm my math, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| I'm not good at math. As I understand it, Sam Lee Road averages between 19 and 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4585)|
| 1:16:35| and the most recent data we have as far as average daily trips are 2,029 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4595)|
| 1:16:42| From that TPO minimum standard values chart, 19 to 20 feet has a capacity, road capacity of 3,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4602)|
| 1:16:51| to 4,000, so we're certainly under capacity now. If you look at the traffic estimation in staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4611)|
| 1:16:58| report, and that was done at five units an acre, we're looking at an average daily trip increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| of 669 trips, so that would make this capacity on Sam Lee 2,698, still within the 3,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4623)|
| 1:17:16| trip capacity for a 19-foot road. This is between 19 and 20. Well, if it goes up to 20, that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| 4,000 average daily trip capacity, so with our development, we're still within the capacity of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| Sam Lee Road at this location and going back at the 19 to 20 feet, so that may change as more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| development comes. It's something I agree, Commissioner Fraser, you need to look at every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| development and see what they're doing and adding to that, but for this project and with our impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4658)|
| 1:17:46| we are within capacity for that road, as I understand it, and Director Snowden can feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| free to articulate and explain that a lot better than I could. So I think this is a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| It's a good project. We know what can go in there with medium-density residential will be a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| more intensive than what it is now. If you look at what Advanced Knox has placemarked this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| to be, that's a traditional neighborhood, and traditional neighborhood, the RA and RB zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| are directly related, and RB zones allow up to 12 units an acre without a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| and the planned residential zones, anywhere from one to 24 units an acre are partially related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| so we think that 4.5 at this property is very appropriate and also gives us some flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4703)|
| 1:18:32| in the county, some flexibility to correct a condition with Sam Lee Road, not just for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| safety, but for the capacity. So I'd ask that you approve 4.5 units an acre. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4717)|
| 1:18:46| Commissioner Brooks, did I have you read the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Yes, you did. I did. Apologize for that. Are there any questions or comments before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| I move forward? Commissioner Frazier. Thank you, Madam Chair. Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| Director Snowden, on Sam Lee, we've got several developments that are not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4741)|
| 1:19:11| Tell me about the vehicle counts for those developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4751)|
| 1:19:19| Because as Mr. Mullen stated, we are falling under the 3,000, but barely. We're coming in at like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4759)|
| 1:19:25| 2,700, but then you've got two developments that have not reached build-out at this time on Sam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4765)|
| 1:19:34| Lee. I want to take a moment too to thank the applicant. I don't know, are they here? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4774)|
| 1:19:45| I want to thank them. They have been tremendous in working with the community and really just asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4785)|
| 1:19:53| what is your vision and taking the considerations and really trying to work them into a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4793)|
| 1:20:03| I also know that Mr. Clark is here and didn't know if Mr. Clark wanted to make any sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| make any sort of comments or if you had anything to add to the discussion. He is one of the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| property owners and he had some concerns. And again, both Mr. Mullins, Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| the applicant, they've been very willing to work with you and hear those concerns. I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| make sure that you are you're okay with everything that you've heard. I've got him. I've got him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4826)|
| 1:20:41| I've got it. Okay. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| Yeah. Commissioner Fraser, I'd be glad to. But Ms. Brooks may still may have some comments too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| but Hayden Hills is, if it's not fully developed out, it's very, very close and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4852)|
| 1:20:59| Hayden Farms looks like it does have some capacity left. We did require them from memory to widen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4859)|
| 1:21:10| I think Hayden Farms or Hayden Hills, pardon me, had to widen up to their entrance and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| Hayden Farms had to widen from their entrance back to I think it was a minimum of 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4875)|
| 1:21:25| as far as the number of trips that will be generated by that development. I'd have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| do a little further math, but I did want to let you know that we did require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| widening of the developers of both those subdivisions to improve assembly to a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| point. Okay. But again, that's only, that's only impacting safety, not capacity. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4898)|
| 1:21:47| So really when the buildout is completed of those two subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| we're going to exceed capacity on this road. I drive this road almost daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4911)|
| 1:22:01| And I have, you know, I've mentioned this. I've had, I've had concerns again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| I think this applicant has been tremendous and worked with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| I'm just really trying to think, I hope you can appreciate that I'm really trying to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| long-term and the impact on existing established communities because there's a lot of growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4932)|
| 1:22:21| on Sam Lee. And I know we're really trying to mitigate that. We're really trying to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| it, improving it. But because of the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| there's not a lot that we can do. So we do have to consider every vehicle trip that we add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4951)|
| 1:22:40| So those are just my comments. Commissioner Frazier, may I ask a question to Director Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| about that? Just in this minimum standard values that I have, it does look like there's a correlation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| between minimum road width and capacity from average daily trips. And I just want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| sure I understand, like, for example, the capacity for a road of 20 feet is 4,000 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| If you go up to 21, it's 5,000 trips. And if you get up to 24 feet of width, it's 10,000 trips a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4980)|
| 1:23:07| day. So I just want to make sure I understand, does road width also address capacity or just safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4987)|
| 1:23:17| It's a little bit of both. When you think of capacity, capacity is usually dealt with in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| vehicle delay because you think of usually capacity at a traffic signal. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| you've got so much vehicle delay. Capacity on a two-lane road, and I've had this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| with Commissioner Frazier, is really the, it's one of the most difficult things to establish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| So what our consultant did as part of this analysis was look at a point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| these, above those volumes at that width, it became problematic from both a safety and capacity. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=5023)|
| 1:23:52| I correlate it to be a little bit of both. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| Are there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| Commissioner Frazier, I do echo your concerns. I do know especially that from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240325-zoning?start=5043)|
