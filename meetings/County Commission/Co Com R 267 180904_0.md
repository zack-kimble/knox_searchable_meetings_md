| 0:04:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=296)|
| 0:05:06| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Thank you. Thank you, my fellow commissioners. Uh, I really am at a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| of a loss of words. But, uh, one thing that I'd like to say, I guess if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| will set any kind of tone is my belief is that the chairman of this board is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| servant to this board. This is a servant's job that works for you. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=325)|
| 0:05:33| also say as we look, I think split votes are great votes. We all represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| different points of view. We all have different ideas. You know, our our folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| elected us all for different passions. So split votes, vigorous debate are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| welcome. And that's what our community wants. I think also something that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| been nice to see is civility. Eso I remember one time I remember, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| we're at a training. I remember Commissioner Daly mentioning one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| you know, hey, once the votes over, we kind of move on. And I think that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| right approach to have. I also think that civility is appropriate as we work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| with our partners at the school board, City Council, our state representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| and throughout this community, even our staff that works for us at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| So, um, anyhow, thank you. I'll do my best. The only guarantee I could make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| is that I've got the law director here to help compensate if I make a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| on Robert rules of order. So, uh, if that's how we start, but anyhow, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| want to thank you for your vote, and I'm looking forward to being your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| servant. So thank you. Uh, moving on on and also for our guests in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| audience and the public back home. The purpose of this meeting is to elect our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| other officers and to as a board select folks to serve on committees for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| County Commission. Uh, those committees and those votes will take place via| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| resolutions that have been put on this agenda. So process wise, as we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| through our agenda, you'll see us first elect a vice chair. But then, as we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| into committee assignments, you're gonna see us, um, elect, uh, members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| this body to committees. Then you're gonna see us actually vote on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| resolution to codify those elections. Uh, you also see for for those watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| at home, you'll see us or I don't see that the TV folks, but for members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| the audience, you will see us after the selections have been made to say who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| gonna be on those committees. The chair will call those. We will go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| recess, and those committees will be called to order. The chair will begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| that committee meeting. That committee will elect a chair, and then the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| will proceed to elect a vice chair. And then, uh, unless there's any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| business in that committee, that committee meeting will close. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| saying primarily heads, heads nodding. So I think we're all on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| with that. Does that all make sense? So, uh, uh, Madam Clerk, I'll go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| let you call it the next item on our agenda. We've got the election of a vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| chair. Okay, so the next order of business is to, uh, elect a vice chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=495)|

| 0:17:05| And I served on this committee past, so if we'd like, we can keep the same committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| together. That was Anders, Busler, Carringer, Gill, and Nystrom. You going to take yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=1029)|
| 0:17:18| off of Biggs? I can drop for Biggs. I don't care. Actually, I'm sorry. I'll take myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=1038)|

| 0:17:29| track here. The motion I'd like to entertain would be a motion to accept this slate by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=1049)|
| 0:17:45| acclamation. So moved. Is there a second? The motion was made by Anders and seconded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=1065)|

| 0:18:15| committees. Then we will recess commission. And after we have recessed commission, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| is when each one of these committees will meet individually. Number four on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=1101)|

| 0:45:44| commissioners who have been serving, if they'd like to serve another four-year term, or if we can just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| frankly open the floor up for nominations for other commissioners to serve on this committee. It is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2749)|

| 0:46:27| nominated by Commissioner Bussler. I'll go ahead. Go ahead. I mean, I'll serve if nobody else wants to. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2787)|

| 0:47:25| concludes that one. Moving on, we have item number eight on the agenda. Madam Clerk, would you please call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| This is R-18-9-104-SS. It's a consideration of a resolution to approve a resolution to approve a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee reappointing commissioners and reappointing Jim Morrison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| to the Knox County Audit Committee. Okay. All right. As a point of order, and I might point out that this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2864)|
| 0:47:55| committee that Commissioner Schoonmaker worked hard on this past month to pass a resolution clarifying the term of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| service on this particular committee. So thank you, John, for adding that clarification at last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2881)|
| 0:48:12| So the point being, we had, it was unclear in our rules if, for example, as we look at it, the intent of the rules was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2892)|
| 0:48:24| appoint commissioners to four-year terms on this committee. Schoonmaker and I, as a matter of fact, have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| at that time were appointed to what was finishing folks' terms. John, as chair, I'd prefer not to talk about this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2910)|
| 0:48:38| if you'd like to go ahead and add a summary of that before we, I guess we would probably need to have a nomination if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| you and I would both like to continue to serve on this for us to continue in that service. And then we will have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| opening for another commissioner on this. Taking my chairperson hat off, I would like, as Hugh from the 4th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| District, I would like to continue to serve on this committee. Correct. And what we would do is if Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2935)|
| 0:49:03| Nystrom and Schoonmaker were reappointed to this committee, we would serve the balance of our commission terms. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| we would serve two years, and then the third member would serve a four-year term. So it's staggered. And then we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2949)|
| 0:49:17| be reappointing Jim Morrison. They would serve whatever is left of their term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| Of whose term? The executive official you put into it will serve whatever term they have left in that capacity on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| audit committee. Right. But I was saying if it was Hugh and I, it would just be a two-year. You've got to assume Dave wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| to come off first. Well, Dave's not part of that. He is. No, he was not a two-year termer two years ago. We've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2975)|
| 0:49:46| put three people on there here regardless. Right. Okay. So what I'd like to say, John clarified through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| resolution at last month's meeting, just to make it cleaner, but at this point we do still need to have a nomination on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=2992)|
| 0:50:00| floor for the appointment of the folks who will serve or continue to serve on the audit committee. So at this point, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3000)|

| 0:59:10| Okay. For this particular seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| I believe that Commissioner Busler has served in this in the past, but I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| entertain nominations for someone to serve in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| Commissioner Busler, he hasn't put a railroad through my front yard yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| Okay, do we have any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| I'm going to nominate Commissioner Smith because he needs to learn where the rails go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| I could make a joke about y'all having a one-track mind, but I'm going to try to avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| So are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3585)|

| 0:59:55| But it will spike the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| All right, Commissioner Daley has made a motion to cease nominations. Do I have a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| I'll second it, but I don't think Commissioner Smith wants to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| All right, I'll go ahead and ask Commissioner Smith, if elected to this position, would you serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| No, I think Commissioner Busler is the perfect choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| All right, Commissioner Busler, would you like to continue your long service to the Railroad Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman, and I'm planting a railroad right through the middle of his yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| What I'd like to entertain is a motion by acclamation for Commissioner Busler to continue his service in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3630)|
| 1:00:38| Do I have that motion? So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| It's moved by Commissioner Daley and seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3644)|

| 1:01:27| Knox County Pension and Retirement Board has a separate subcommittee that serves as an investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| This particular committee is the committee that serves along with the trustee's office and our financial advisors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| and representatives from the school board to review and help monitor our overall county finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| and where we have our cash deployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3707)|

| 1:02:11| So you're already on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=3732)|

| 1:10:14| Yes, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Are you going to clarify which term each individual is serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| One rolls off on December 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| We will clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| This first nomination, which we have Commissioner Biggs for, that was the first nomination that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| came in, so I'd like to slot Commissioner Biggs, if it's acceptable to commission, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| the first open position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| The second nominee was Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| Unless we have a third or fourth nomination, if it's those two, my initial instinct is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| to have Commissioner Carringer put in that second slot, based on the order of nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| if that is agreeable to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| Is that okay with you, Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4260)|
| 1:11:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| I'd now like to have a motion for this resolution, which is, by the way, I don't believe we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4263)|
| 1:11:11| a motion to cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| Yeah, we had a motion without a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| It was set by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| All in favor to cease nominations, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| Next, I'd like to entertain a motion to pass Resolution R-18-9110-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4287)|
| 1:11:35| The resolution reads, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| appointing Commissioner Justin Biggs to serve an unfulfilled term expiring December 31,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| 2018, and appointing Commissioner Michelle Carringer to serve an unfulfilled term expiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4306)|
| 1:11:53| December 31, 2019, on the Arena Use Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| So moved by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Are we done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| I'll also ask you to speak to that too, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4337)|
| 1:12:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| I'd also, first of all, I've got a very important announcement, and then I'd also like to entertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| any other announcements that are happening in your districts or committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| But it is likely, not likely, but it is imperative that we will need to call a previously unscheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4357)|
| 1:12:46| meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| This is going to be related to approving the bonds for our Sheriff's Deputy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| I'm going to ask the Law Director to provide some clarification on that, but we are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| voting on that or doing that at this meeting because it's not in our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| But I would like to have the Law Director provide some insight to this, and then likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| on our Commissioner's Forum, we will put out some dates to have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| So go ahead, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| This body is required to approve the bonds for both the Trustee and the Sheriff, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4395)|
| 1:13:23| we only have a limited amount of days after they've taken office to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| And the Chairman and I have talked about this, and he's going to call a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| It will be put on the forum for you all to agree to the special call meeting so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| we can get the bonds registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| They're under bond, they're bonded right now, but the statutory procedure is you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| to approve so that we can have it registered with the registered deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| So it's a technicality, but we need to get it done pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| And what is the exact deadline on that, just for the Commission and the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| Okay, we have 20 days from the time they take office, so we have to have it registered and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| voted on before September the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| So I'll be meeting with your Chairman, he'll select a date, and then he'll put it on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4451)|
| 1:14:17| forum, which will be public, and then we need time for notice, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| So it should be happening pretty soon for you all to vote on the special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| John, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| You had a look on your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Yeah, no, I was just, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| So we can't talk about dates or anything at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| Not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| I'll visit with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| We'll likely, when some dates are put on our forum, I'll make sure that Drusilla has sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| out an announcement that those have been posted to our forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| But this is obviously a very important item to get on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| Yes, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| By the Commission here, will this be done at an a.m. or p.m. type time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4493)|
| 1:15:01| I'll, if this Commission would, generally speaking, are there any preferences for when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| we put these choices out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Do you have a preference for morning or afternoon, Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| If you do it early enough, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| If you do it like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| Midday is bad, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Eight, nine, something like that would be good, because from now on out, from the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| of the month, there's other meetings that we go to that's during the day at lunchtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| than we have some in the afternoons and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| And they are community meetings, which are important to the people in my district, especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| Just to clarify, we'll be voting on the bonds for the sheriff and the trustee at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| There'll be one single resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| The resolution topic will be put out on the forum, so you'll know what the subject is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| I just wanted to make sure that the new commissioners have access to the forum at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| Probably not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| We will talk to Zach to make sure that you guys get access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| To clarify, and also for the public and any of our guests who are here at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| today, the forum was developed for Knox County commissioners to debate or discuss items online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4575)|
| 1:16:23| in a public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| It is easily accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| The public can look at what's happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| So it is a sunshine venue that is open to the public if we have to publish items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| need to be clarified, such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| And we'll make sure that the IT department follows up with you guys to make sure you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| So at this time, I know we're all awfully busy serving our community, so I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| open up the floor just by a show of lights if you've got any community activities or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| things that you need to share with our county commission and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| Does anybody have any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4613)|

| 1:17:53| I look forward to working with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| What I might make is one other announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Looking back at some things we've discussed at this meeting, Legacy Parks, I believe they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| probably got their fall dinner or their fall luncheon coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| It's very important for us as a commission to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| I'll make sure, I think in the past commission has tried to put together a table for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| Commissioner Busler, have you got an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| I'm just recalling at this meeting we usually discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| We normally discuss buying a table and that's for all commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| And let's see, I forgot what the date was, but we do have availability to get a table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| now and we can call over there and reserve that table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| But now this will come out of our discretionary constituent funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| It's Friday, October 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| The new commissioners will go ahead and spend $500 apiece for that and the rest of us will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| take up the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| Commissioner Caringer, then I have one other point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| I just want to say thank you all for electing me to be your vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| I will promise to be there to support everybody and everyone and especially to help out our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4750)|
| 1:19:19| chairman and I just appreciate the opportunity to serve and I'm looking forward to having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4759)|
| 1:19:27| a great year for Knox County with our new additions to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| I want to remind everybody about the fair lunch this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| I think it's at noon, 1130 or noon, but that's a great event and I'm looking forward to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4780)|
| 1:19:46| great fair sitting on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| Well, I acknowledge these two lights and then I've got one other final announcement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| I want to ask everybody to kind of keep your game face on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| Go ahead, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| The legacy part of the lunch, unfortunately, I will not be able to make it this time, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| One thing I'd like to ask, I'm going to look at Drusilla, I'm going to look at the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| director and I'm going to look at, I guess, via word of mouth for all of our county departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| as well as the newly elected county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| When several of us, when I believe the four of us first came on the commission two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| ago, immediately following this meeting, there was a training where we met with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| the department heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| The law department reviewed Sunshine Law and it was kind of a good kickstart to everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| commissioner careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| I remember I was very grateful for that training and Commissioner Wright was the driver on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| it and it was a really good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| The state did pass a law that required, and many of us also went and participated in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| that required all new commissioners to do the training in Nashville and Murfreesboro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| that took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| However, I don't think that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| We do have a new administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| There's still some, as we've seen, some changes happening in department heads, but what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| going to ask Drusilla and myself and other members of this body, the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| we will work together to put together something that will be open to all commissioners that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| I'm not sure if we can pull it out between now and our next meeting, but likely in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| we'll probably put together some sort of similar training for both of y'all and also for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| I know that the mayor's probably put in a few new department heads and there's Zach's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| new in IT, there's a new head of recreation, and I think by then the new mayor will probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| be a little bit more settled in and it would probably be appropriate three or four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| from now to have a similar type of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| I'm seeing heads nodding in agreement, so we'll begin to pursue that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| I just want to remind you all that we are a member of the TCCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| They will be getting letters and things from the state from the Tennessee County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| and CTASC also that will have training over here on Henley Street through the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| of Tennessee and that goes through all kinds of manner of training of what to look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| as a county commissioner and what jobs are done throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| And they will address it since it's here in this area as a charter government and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| charter government operates differently than other county governments, so we've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| keep that in mind also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| I guess in closing I just want to let y'all know how grateful and humbled I am to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| to serve this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| At the very beginning I said my take on this role is that the chair is a servant to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| commission and I look forward to serving in that way for all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| We've got a great community, this is a great commission, and as a body we've grown so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| over the last decade and I'm humbled and it's a privilege to be able to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| At this point I'll call this meeting to adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180904?start=4986)|
