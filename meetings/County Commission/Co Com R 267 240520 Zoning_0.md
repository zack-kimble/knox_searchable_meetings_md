| 0:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| And the staff approved this project based on what the developer presented to NOx planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=635)|
| 0:10:45| in the planning process at Planned Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| At what point during the meeting did they ask to have that switched from Planned Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=649)|

| 0:11:10| The request of the applicant was to go to R.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| Staff's recommendation was Planned Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| There were conversations that were had in advance with the applicant if they were okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| And the planning commission did vote for Planned Residential, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| So in layman's terms, what's the downside for the developer to continue with the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=691)|

| 0:15:36| We have owned the property on Red Hallard Lane next to 10022 Bob Gray Road for over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| 20 years now, and not much has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| We have lived here since there was a small white house and a single trailer on the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=943)|

| 0:15:54| As I mentioned in the planning meeting, Knox County PR zoning is not very clear, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| wanted to investigate our options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| We have been told conflicting information about what could and couldn't be put on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| property in the email and phone correspondences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| We thought rezoning to RA would eliminate that confusion and allow us different options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| as well as still fit the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| This property is about two-thirds of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| It is unique because it's between two neighborhoods, a busy road, and a mobile home park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| If any piece of land should require RA zoning, this would be it, since RA is more versatile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| for low-density residential, and it fits in with the other RA zones in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Now I would like to address some of the concerns that were brought up in the first planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| meeting, drainage safety, access, and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| For drainage, complaints posted on the website regarding drainage are from the far side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| Festival Lane, more towards Dutchtown Road, and were not directly on our drainage side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| During that previous planning meeting, county engineering stated there was no issue for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| drainage with any use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| The drainage was stated as more than adequate as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| On safety, we understand that homeowners would want to keep things safe, but safety is dependent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Out of the 16 homes on Redheader Lane, four homes are currently rentals, and we have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| problems of drugs, police calls, and subleasing with renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| People in any dwelling can bring safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| A concern was brought up about the access to Redheader Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| If mobile homes are to be put on the property, we have not made a decision as to what to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| do with the property, and that was never our intention to allow traffic through to Redheader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| Lane for mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| After all, we are the closest to the lot, and we would be the first home affected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| any decision we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| We would like to address this concern by asking to voluntarily place a condition on the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| to Redheader Lane if R.A. is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| The condition would be for R.A. zoning, access to Redheader Lane would not be used for mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| As for traffic, adding two more homes with access to Redheader Lane would not create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| that much more traffic than the cul-de-sac, with currently only two driveways that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| could support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| In comparison, Dutchtown Woods Neighborhood has up to seven driveways on their cul-de-sacs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| Also, I would like to note the access is only 26 feet wide, which is one single driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| I also feel if our decision falls into single family homes, that we should be able to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| the road and cul-de-sac just like any other single family home on the Redheader Lane as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1085)|

| 0:18:14| That is why we proceeded to check the zoning requirements for this piece of property, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| only for us, but the surrounding neighborhoods and community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1098)|

| 0:18:25| I believe the rezoning of the property to R.A. is consistent with all the criteria of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| this area based on the Planning Commission's findings, and due to this property's unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1108)|

| 0:18:36| The R.A. zoning allows for more clear building allowances that are similar to the area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| does not add, by its own merit, any problems with drainage, security, or traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| By voluntarily placing a condition on the access in R.A., all the concerns should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| R.A. zone is consistent with the adjacent properties and would fit into the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| density of the zone, in this case, of five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1133)|

| 0:20:20| neighborhood structure that's a cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1220)|

| 0:20:30| We purchased the land because we knew we wanted to have kids there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1230)|

| 0:21:15| multifamily dwellings, putting in mobile homes or trailers is something that's not desirable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| for the folks that I'm speaking on behalf of or myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Connecting Bob Gray directly to the Red Heller Lane, making basically a semi-loop, turning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| it from a cul-de-sac to a loop that connects to Bob Gray, or even doing it by two private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| drives is also something undesirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| I haven't heard any suggested plans for that, but I did want to put that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| I think the biggest, the biggest thing that is, is, is a concern of the mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| While the applicant has indicated the desire to possibly go with single family dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| my understanding is the current zoning they have achieved can allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| So other, other zoning would allow more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| And we request that if, if the board strongly consider, basically they've been a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| bit uncertain about where they want to go with the property, what they want to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| So we'd like the commission to think of some guardrails up that basically keep trailers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| from being built there connected to Red Heller Lane, multifamily dwellings connected to Red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| Heller Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| We want to keep the integrity of our neighborhood, not only for the safety of our children, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| also for our property values, which I doubt will be compensated for if trailers go onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| the property connected to Red Heller Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| So basically that is our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Basically connecting Red Heller Lane to the trailer park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| Right now we have a buffer that, that, that property was the buffer between a current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| mobile home park and that, that house was torn down and the, the, the, the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| purchased that property and, and they're going to use that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| So that's kind of a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| And if we see trailers go in there and no one wants to see trailers period, but if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| did go in, we'd want them connected to Bob Gray directly as well as multifamily dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| I see I've let my time expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| If you'd state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| Cody Coonrad, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| So hello, my name is Cody Coonrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| I live at 10131 Red Heller Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| I purchased the property in March of this year and live there with my wife and four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| I've lived in Knoxville for over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| I spoke with Doug and understand that as of yesterday, he and his wife have no final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Previously, I thought the plan was mobile homes and he mentioned mobile homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| So I would have reworded my email to you guys, but this may be my only time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| So I need to address the many possibilities for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| As no plan is set, I'm speaking against two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| One against some of the potential uses allowed by RA zoning and two against rezoning period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| or at least for the approved plan to be limited to that approved by the planning board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| I'm for two single family homes as approved by the planning board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| And I quote the planning board members at minute 48 of the April 11th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| If they want to do anything other than single family, then it would have to come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| And if so, if they want to move forward with two single family residences connecting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| the subdivision of 16 houses, I don't think that's going to overburden the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| It could be a good addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| I'd like to make the motion to approve RA because it's consistent with the sector planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| We have a motion to approve RA for staff recommendation, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| This shows that the approval was based on two single family homes of similar quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| but Doug has said he was considering single family or prebuilt or mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| From Knox County representative at minute 44, under the existing zoning, they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| do multiple units, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| This shows PR is acceptable for the approved use of two single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| Some quotes from Doug around minute 32, we were trying to explore our options, they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| conflicting information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| It wasn't until the sign was posted that they found out some of the options were allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| They wanted RA zoning because that would eliminate any future confusion, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| Doug has some ideas of what they would want to do or what they could do, and he told the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| board that he did not understand his options until after submitting rezoning and still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| is unsure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| The planning board didn't clarify with him, but rather approved RA based on a limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| use that was already allowed under PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| With all that, I'm against any development that would make Red Hellard a two-entry street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| including connected private drives between Bob Gray and Red Hellard for the reasons presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| I'm against mobile homes period of any count or kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Even if not connected to Red Hellard, it would remove the current buffer between the mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| home park, Red Hellard, and Cresthaven, allowing easier access and reduced home values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| There's a large difference in number of safety incidents per dwelling between the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| mobile home park and the surrounding neighborhoods, see LexisNexis crime maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| I'm against substations, cell towers, and the like for many quality of life and home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| value issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Though I doubt that's the plan, I would like to officially remove that as an option if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Overall, I'm disappointed with the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| Doug did not present a plan, and he expressed that he was uncertain in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| At that point, the planning board could have stopped and asked for a clear plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| Instead, they approved a zone change based on one of the possible many options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| I believe the result was a disservice to the Pollocks and the surrounding neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| and I think it added undue tension for the neighborhood in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1561)|
| 0:26:09| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Steve Tuschelski, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| And I reside in the Cresthaven neighborhood, which backs up to that cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| My property is directly behind the applicant's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| So as we kind of learned about this, it was a little late in the game for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| We heard about this after the planning had already been approved, and there was no notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| to us, even though as a resident right there, it would have been nice to have been notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| about this change coming or even being applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| So that was a little disturbing that we didn't know anything about this, even though our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| property backs up to where this request to change is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| There's also multiple people down our street, of which we'll have the same concern of not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| being notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Five things come to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| I've got six kids, and the security of our property is very solid right now, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| and it's because we have a buffer with the trailer park that is across the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| So this would remove that buffer and allow easier access, not only to our property, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| to other adjoining properties down our street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| And our concern with that would be the increase in crime and exposure to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| Property values, obviously, depending on what gets put in there, because I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| a lot of different stories on that, as been alluded to, not sure what the plan is, that'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| impact our property if we ever try to sell it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| The infrastructure, I'm not an engineer, but I do have some concerns about the erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| that's already happening on the backside of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| So this would remove trees that are further up and potentially cause even more problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| which I'm already having issues with, with my fence coming down because of the erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| that's already occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| The big issue for us is privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| We're going to lose that with the buffer being removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| Potential security risk to our children and other children in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| And the fact that there was no heads up on this to anybody in our neighborhood that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| change was being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1697)|
| 0:28:27| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Daniel Casey Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| I live at 10112 Red Hillard Lane, direct next door neighbors to the Pollocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| First things first, I guess I've got to give credit where credit is due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| Kyle Ward, where did you get that multicam sport coat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| So I, as some of you that may know me, I work with a lot of PTSD veterans and a thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| gift for one of the guys I was working with was this camouflage jacket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| So I wear it with a lot of pride tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| I appreciate you asking me, but yeah, this is in honor of the guys that I work with and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| all the men and women that served as a disabled veteran brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| So I'll be pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| I was prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| I'm here kind of neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| My wife and I and our three-year-old son are one of the newer residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| We've rented there for four years before we purchased two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| We purchased because of the neighborhood and because of all the neighbors, a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| place to raise a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| People care about each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| This situation has caused a lot of strife, a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| I think there's a lot of non-transparency, but I think that transparency is driven from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| a lack of information, a lack of understanding of the process, and a lack of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| So all I want to do after hearing everything is just lay out some information that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| shared with me, and hopefully you guys with your expertise will take it in and weigh it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| out and share it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| So I shared all the initial concerns of impact to property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| As retired law enforcement, very concerned about safety and security, very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| about the roads being connected into basically ending a cul-de-sac and connecting to a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| throughfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| However, after listening to what Doug set up here and asking for conditions and speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| with him twice and speaking with the other neighbors, most of those concerns that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| seem to be addressed in his request for conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Unless I'm misunderstanding, that pretty much avails me of most of the concerns I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| My family trusts the Pollocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| We trust the concerns that all the neighbors have, but we also trust you guys as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| with your expertise and knowledge that if there are options that we're not all considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| that you guys will bring that forth and help the Pollocks get with a good plan in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| to make the most profit on their property as is their right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| So just as a neutral party, we wanted to share that the concerns are legitimate, but we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| like they're trying their best to address those and do what's best for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| and themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| So we trust the process, we trust them, and we trust the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| I'll give you a couple minutes to respond, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1876)|
| 0:31:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| I appreciate everybody's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Again, the whole point of going through this process was to try to determine what's possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| to put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| I mean, that's the whole reason of trying to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| We talked to the county planning commission trying to understand what is able to put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| RA seemed like it was a good fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| We've spoken basically with all of our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| We tried to talk, we tried to give some options of what we thought was possible, but we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| know really right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| I mean, it's some of our learning process, we're trying to learn what's even acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| We weren't sure like opening it up to the neighborhood that's good for two single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| homes, but you've got the trailer park right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| And I mean, if most of the people don't want to have, they want to have a buffer, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| want to have like a park there or something as a buffer between the mobile home parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| and the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| But at some level, I have to figure out, you know, what is the best option to do with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| That's the whole point of why we're trying to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| We want to do what's best for ourselves, but also for the community as a whole, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| the neighbors, but even, you know, bigger, bigger portion within the mobile home park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| and within people across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| So for us, it's we're trying to do what we think is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| We're not trying to say we're trying to do something to hurt anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| I think a lot of this confusion has been like, we felt like being attacked from behind the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| back and talk to like, we're going to ruin the neighborhood, we're going to try to hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| I think that's very misleading and mis-fundamental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| I mean, we want what's best for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| We lived in the neighborhood for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Our kids grew up on that cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| We have as much passion about what's going on in that cul-de-sac as any of the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| who currently live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| I think we've lived there the longest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| We have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| We bought the land next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| We're trying to figure out what's best for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| So I mean, we're ultimately trying to do what's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| I mean, I think, you know, there's nothing that we want to do to say like we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| to try to, you know, hurt anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| But basically, from our standpoint, you know, I want to do what's best for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| That's the whole reason to go into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| There's been a lot of confusion, even talking to the county commission of what can go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| It's just a matter of what's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| And I mean, that's why we go to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| That's why we try to have this as an open conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| We could have tried to do this behind people's back, but we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| We tried to go through this process as law-abiding citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| So I appreciate that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Hey, staff, what's the zoning density for low-density residential for RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| No, it's five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Not you, staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| It's approximately, I think, 4.3 is what it pencils out to somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| That's the max for RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| So there's a minimum 10,000 square foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| So this would be a down zoning from five to 4.3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| Yeah, they could potentially build up to or put in potentially three lots at PR 1 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2059)|
| 0:34:27| 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| And then the restrictions on PR versus the restrictions on RA for what they can build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| Oops, I just closed that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| Are you asking about the uses that are permitted in RA versus PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| The uses, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| In RA, houses, accessory buildings, mobile homes, churches, gardening, golf courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2085)|
| 0:34:54| public utilities, et cetera, are allowed in RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| And for PR, what it's currently zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| I'm going to read you the list so I don't miss anything, but homes, single family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| attached dwellings can be considered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| So duplexes and single family homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| PR does not include mobile homes, but it can consider duplexes, multi-dwelling structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| and commercial uses if you have a large enough property, 20 acres or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| I'm probably the most pro-development commissioner that's on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| I do not feel comfortable downgrading this to RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| I think PR is fine for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| I think it fits with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| It doesn't make sense to me unless you don't want to build houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| And knowing the area very intimately, it's a residential area that I think more houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| are needed in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| So for me, that's where I stand on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| I agree with Commissioner Ward in looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| I felt like the existing zoning of PR is appropriate and aligns with the existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| It also guarantees that no building permit would be issued for development on any property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| within PR until a written application review of a development plan has been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| And so that gives the residents a little more time and opportunity to speak to things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2182)|
| 0:36:31| you would like included in a development plan, such as a planted vegetative buffer, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| a type A or type B landscape screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| But it gives another layer of opportunity for the residents to have some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| So I'm really comfortable with PR as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| Claire, can we make sure that's in the record that we agreed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| She said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| It is the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| It's the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Please make sure that's in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Director Brooks, these are two lots that we're now listing that the combined acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2226)|
| 0:37:14| is 0.67 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| So it's basically two-thirds of an acre for both lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| 0.67 acres is the approximate size of the tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| So on two-thirds of one acre, how many dwelling units do they want to put on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| That would be a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| But they've not said anything to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| So you've got 0.2 thirds of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| You want to put how many dwelling units on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| It would be two dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Two total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Two total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| One on each lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| And then this development was built out back in, what, 95, something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| 93, 94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| And these were two additional lots that were never built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| So originally, there was a White House and a trailer that was on that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| that was next to the trailer park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| So when Houston Homes bought that property, they bought the 20 acres that surrounds the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| trailer park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| They built the neighborhood of Dutchtown Woods there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Dutchtown Woods then basically, when they were done with it, they had some access that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| they didn't want to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| So we decided to purchase the land, and it's adjacent to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| So we figured there was some advantage for us to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| So you're comfortable with two dwelling units on the total of 0.67 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| Is there any other discussion before turning this over to Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2326)|
| 0:38:55| Seeing none, Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| I spent a lot of time on this, and I actually talked to Mr. Pollack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| I've talked to neighbors, and not only on Red Hillard, but also Dutchtown Woods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| Oak Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| And so it's a concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| And so my motion, I think, to Mr. Pollack's probably not going to be a surprise, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| I try to be very upfront and clear when I talk to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| I'm a lot more comfortable with this going back to PR zone, just because it backs up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| to residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| And 0.67 acres is a small acreage, especially when you're kind of, I mean, if anybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| looked at the, and I'd say most of the commissioners have, looked at the area, it's pretty tight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| And really, as a matter of fact, I ask engineering to go out today, because Oak Haven, the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| of Oak Haven is having some severe drainage issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| And it's coming from that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| It's not coming from the other side of Dutchtown, I don't believe, or Bob Gray, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| And we're, so they're looking into that, but that concerns me of how much more dirt is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| going to be moved when we've already kind of got a drainage issue going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| So what my motion is going to be is to approve PR zone up to two dwelling units an acre with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2413)|
| 0:40:26| the conditions as follows, entrance and exit onto Bob Gray Road, no stub-outs or connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| to Red Hallard, and you will have the 35-foot setback with a landscape buffer A. So those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| are my conditions, and that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| Oh, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| We have a motion on the floor by Oster, a second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| Did you have a question, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Yeah, just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| When you say two units per acre, and he's got less than two-thirds of an acre, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| means he can only do one dwelling on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| Two dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Two dwellings total, but I think in the motion you said per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| So two dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Maximum of two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Maximum of two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| For the two addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| For the two addresses, you only get two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| Okay, but I feel this is a little bit like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| I will let you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Let me jump in here because we want to be very careful because we don't want to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| his rights away because right now, at five units an acre, he has PR five units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| right this second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| He can build three houses, three townhomes, three houses on the .67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| So right now, if I'm him, I would say, I withdraw this because I don't want to get a lower zonage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| than I already have because what you're proposing is to give him less houses than he currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2520)|

| 0:42:05| So the advice, I'm not giving you advice because I'm not supposed to give you advice, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| common sense thing for him to do right now is be like, hey guys, I don't want you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| I'm retracting this right away because you're about to give him less and devalue his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| right in front of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| He's about to lose $50,000 if you do that because he's about to lose a whole entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| So let's not be hasty is my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| I would just vote this down as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| Don't give him the RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| He keeps his zoning just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| We're not going to devalue his property because all he can do right now, if we put that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| up, he would be crazy to let us go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| I would just jump right in and be like, hey, no, I don't want it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Forget this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| I'm going home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| So let's just be sensible here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| I don't want to screw somebody over just because he came in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| So if you want to re-say that, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| But that would be how I see this situation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| We have to be kind of careful here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| We don't want to screw over citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2588)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Mr. Law Director, I believe if the motion would be to deny RA, Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| it will stay PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| If you deny the motion, if you deny his request, then it'll be whatever it was before he came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| To get a clarification here for just a second, he's got two individual lots that are, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2628)|
| 0:43:56| has got a permanent address, the other one is a zero address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| So you're saying he can get two houses on one lot and one house on the other for a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| of three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| If he has .67 acres in total, he can combine his lots at any point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| So he has to look at his one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| So he has .67 units of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| If he has five units an acre, that gives him 3.3 houses, so he's allowed to build three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| It can be split into three lots right now, as it currently stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| So he can build three townhomes, or he can build three houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| But he's not asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| He's just asking for two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| He's not asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| You've got to be careful, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| There's a whole trick to this whole game, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| He's going and asking for an RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| The only reason you ask for an RA in this situation is you don't want to build a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| You're not trying to call him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| That's the only reason why you would do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| That's why I said, I'm not for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Keep it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| He has to build a house or a townhome, which is what everybody just said they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| He has the right to build that right now, as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| Just because people want to de-downzone doesn't mean it's necessarily the best thing for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| So it's an extremely dense area already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| This density is not going to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| He's allowed to move the dirt already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| There's nothing stopping him from building three houses right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| So you don't want to take people's money and their rights away without it being as crystal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2720)|
| 0:45:29| clear as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| So I'm just trying to make it crystal clear as possible for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| So the best thing in his interest is to say, I'm retracting this and go home because he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| not going to get, well, I don't know if he's going to get it or not, but it doesn't sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| like he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| He can ask to take it away if he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| I don't know how to mean I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| I mean, I'm just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Yeah, I'm just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| I'm trying to explain the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| As long as everybody understands, that's the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| He can currently build three houses or three townhomes on the acreage that he has because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| it's currently zoned for PR5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| If you approve it, yeah, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| That's what he currently has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Just had a question or actually, this is what I think what is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| These two lots were a part of a subdivision that by developing it, it isn't going to directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| really impact that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| It's impacting an adjacent subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| And so these two lots were left open because of flooding, that there were flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| That's an assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| There was no flooding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| The two lots were left empty for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| That makes me a little bit leery as to why these two were left empty and in a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| new adjacent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| So they were left open for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| But I think that's what's really confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| And this is the hang up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| To Commissioner Ward's point, the PR up to five of the subdivision that these two lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2824)|
| 0:47:12| are actually a part of, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| But I think what the commissioner of the district is saying that it should align more to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| subdivision that it actually impacts, which is those living on Red Hillard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2843)|
| 0:47:32| So I think we're kind of at a really tough spot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| All of these are valid points, but I agree with Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2864)|
| 0:47:51| It seems that the applicant has no desire to put more than, to create a third lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| So, you know, I would take him at his word on that, but regardless, my vote will be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2878)|
| 0:48:07| deny this rezoning and let it stay like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| If we have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| If we don't, maybe we should create it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| Well, I'm not going to do that yet, but I'm hoping the maker of the motion will agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| But we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| I just want to say on the microphone, the thing that we were discussing over here, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| was Commissioner Ward was saying that he could just ask for a withdrawal and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| Some years ago, this got changed in our rules in section G of our rules on top of page 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| It says for any applicant who asks for a withdrawal at the commission zoning session, the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| shall be considered a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| So unless he gets suddenly ill and runs off to the bathroom and is not heard from again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2929)|
| 0:48:57| you can't just say I want to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| You can, but it's considered a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| So it ends up being the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| I just don't want to set the precedence that we take money away from citizens when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2947)|

| 0:49:14| And if he wants to build two houses, he has the right right now to build two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| I just don't want to take away any more of his rights is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| So if he has the right to build three, I don't want to take his right to build three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| and devalue his land and take $50,000 away from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2970)|

| 0:49:41| I just have a really hard moral, a very big moral struggle and taking money away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| people, especially when that's not what they came here for in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2986)|
| 0:49:54| Commissioner Polak, you look like you're about to, I mean, Mr. You look like you're about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| to explode there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| Did you have something you would like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| I mean, originally, the whole point of this process was to try to figure out what can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| be put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| It's a very difficult situation because you have mobile home park and we have neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| So we're trying to do what's best for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| Our intention was always basically to to consider what our best options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| We originally approached the county engineering asking what could be put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| They gave us different answers of what could or couldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| We asked, can pre-manufactured homes be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| Can modular homes be put there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| They said, no, not under the PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| So because of the proximity to the mobile home parks, it makes it very difficult for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| any real buddy to find that property desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| So that's why we thought, since we own the property adjacent to it, is to add that access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| to the Red Heather Lane to give that as to make it more desirable for somebody to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| that as being an attractive option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| There was never this intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| This is the part that's really frustrating is like, we're not trying to do anything that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| going to harm anybody, but everybody is up in arms about, you know, trying to devalue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| And the whole point of this was we were trying to figure out what our options were, but,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| you know, to get to get like attacked or to be, you know, suggesting that we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| to do something wrong is is is very disheartening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| But again, I can only say that for for what we want to do, I mean, we don't have a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| We're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| This is the whole process of why we're doing this is trying to figure out what is best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| I mean, like I said, everybody just wanted it to be a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| But there's stuff that we have to consider as far as we've invested money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| We've invested time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| We're just trying to do what's best for them, for the for the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| I mean, that's that's our that's our goal is to do what's best for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| If if like Mr. Ward said, I mean, I'm I'm not against a PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| I was told that originally PR had things that we couldn't put on it, meaning pre-manufactured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| homes or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| And we would do that access to the main road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| I mean, that's going to take capital on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| You know, that depends on how much money we're willing to put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| But again, it was never an intention to do any harm to anybody or to do anything that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| going to cause this this kind of to strife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| I mean, it's caused us a lot of stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Sure, it's caused them a lot of stress, but it all goes back to we were told certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| during the engineering planning discussion and we were like, well, let's just go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| I mean, it's a little bit of ignorance on our part, but we're also trying to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| out it's an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| I mean, as far as what what's required and what what is what is best, because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| you guys have that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| You guys have that that ability to make, you know, the community better or worse based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| on all the discussions that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| I mean, all these all these zoning issues, I mean, that's building the community, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| building the Knox County as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| I mean, we're trying to do what we think is best for our little community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| And it's a little spot that, you know, we've lived there for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| And I know a lot of these neighbors have lived there for multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| So I mean, again, I can only say that we're not trying to do anything that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| hurt anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| That's the reason why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| That's the reason why we're trying to to see what is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| I mean, I don't want to spend a lot of time investing, investigating pre-manufactured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| homes or, you know, because there's a mobile home park, there's a mobile homes is acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| if that's not a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| So again, it goes back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| And that's the frustrating part is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| And I think even during the last meeting last week, the code for Knox County is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| When I went to a pre-manufactured home builder, I asked him, can we put a home there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| They said, well, where is the home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| They said, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| They said, we have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| You're going to have to ask Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| And that's what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| I asked Knox County and they didn't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| So that's the frustrating part is that the decision has to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| So somehow I have to know what I can put there within my.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| And we're going to work that out for you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Mr. Pollack, it sounds like just from your discussion that you are looking to do a pre-manufactured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| That was an option, but we would always the idea of a pre-manufactured home was open it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| up to the main road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| The issue is because of the proximity to the mobile home park, we figured that was a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| enough buffer in between the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| We wouldn't add that access to the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| That wouldn't be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| But that was an option that we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| Originally, we thought, oh, we put two houses there, you know, stick build houses, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| modular homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| I don't know if that's, you know, what is a modular home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| How does that fit into the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| But like, you know, something that would be a home that would fit into the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| that was always kind of the original intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| But then you start talking about with the proximity to the mobile home park, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| is that desirable for somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| You know, well, then what about these other options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| I mean, Knox County needs, you know, places for people to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| I mean, Knox County is a growing county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| I mean, we're busting at the seams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| And I guess, I mean, everybody can pay $500,000, $600,000 for a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| And then you're talking about somebody who can't afford a $300,000 house as a pre-manufactured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| I mean, I don't know where the fairness is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| I mean, we got to make it, you know, as a community, as a whole, we got to make some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| kind of understanding of what is a reasonable use of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| And how do you determine everybody wants to make a million dollar house and put a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| dollar house somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| But there's not that kind of, people don't have that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| So I mean, we can debate back and forth about what is right and what is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| But I mean, again, I'm trying to think of, as a whole, what's good for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| as well as myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| But I mean, that's the reason why we've gone through this process is to try to figure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| And I appreciate you for keeping the consideration of lower cost housing top of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3337)|
| 0:55:47| And I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Because as you mentioned, we need places for people to be able to afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| My question is, specifically, what type of dwelling are you looking at putting on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| two lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| I think the original idea was to sell it as single family dwellings, either modular homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| or stick built houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Well, that's the difference between the zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| So if you know what you're going to build, that's where the PR or the RA comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3373)|
| 0:56:21| So that's why we're kind of at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| That's the frustration from what I gather from the neighbors is there's just there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| no specific type of dwelling that they know is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| And so I feel like that's where the frustration with the neighbors and, well, at least with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| myself, I don't know about other commissioners and I won't speak for them, comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| Because it would be a lot easier if we knew specifically what your plan was, what type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3406)|
| 0:56:52| of dwelling you were looking to build, because that's where the difference in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| I have a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| What is the land, what is the land access deeded to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| Staff, you might be able to answer this question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| What deeded access rights does he have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| Is he deeded access to any, to these roads, or is he only deeded access to the main road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| Yeah, the, excuse me, Commissioner Ward, the plat that was recorded when the landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3440)|
| 0:57:29| created the, or I guess so divided the lot, it notes that access is to be, it says, lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3449)|
| 0:57:38| 90R, which is the lot that fronts Bob Gray, his access is to be via Red Hillard Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3458)|
| 0:57:45| only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| It does say, though, that required standards per Knox County must be met before access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| via Bob Gray will be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| So it looks like that if there was, you know, line of sight and other appropriate driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| spacings met, he could obtain access to Bob Gray, but the plat does contemplate the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| on to Red Hillard, at least at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| So if the line of sight in that, he could exit out to Bob Gray in theory, if the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| of sight was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| It's a pretty straight area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| It is kind of a hill curve up to that area, but actually it runs flat from what I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| for about a hundred yards, if not more, until you get to where that lot is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| It, I mean, you know, I want to, it looks like based on what I'm seeing is that he could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| probably meet the required standards for the access control policy to get access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| And do you control that or is that, what's the firing mechanism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| What's the trigger to, he has to go in front of you and ask for access in front of you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| He would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| He'd have to submit an access permit or driveway permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| Remember zoning goes with the land, not the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| You know, if it was to been changed to RA, he could sell the land, they could build anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| It doesn't matter what he wants to do right now, is the zoning goes with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| And that's why we should be denied and left as is, that way we know he's, he's what he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| can and cannot do for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| I mean, I don't disagree with my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| The issue that I've got, and I'd already checked with Director Snowden, that we have the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3572)|
| 0:59:40| of sight and we have the entrance and exit off of Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| So if I deny this, they still have ability to connect to Red Hallard, which is exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3586)|
| 0:59:54| what my community and my district is telling me they don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3594)|
| 1:00:12| This one's been a tough one for a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3612)|
| 1:00:25| Do you wish to change your original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| I do think I'm going to, I'm almost, I tell you what I'm almost thinking about doing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3628)|
| 1:00:48| postponing this for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| And reason being, Mr. Pollack, is because I think, and I think that if you email Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3652)|
| 1:01:02| Snowden or Director Brooks directly, you're going to get no confusion on what you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| I promise you, those two are not going to give you any confusion on what you can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| in a PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| Because that's where I'm leaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| But like I said, my issue is, and when I have heard and the commission has heard emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| from my district that, I mean, this is a one street neighborhood with 15 houses on it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| a cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| That's why these people bought these houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| They don't want connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| And the kids still play outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| That's very rare that that happens now a days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| So it really gives me heartburn that that's even the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3701)|
| 1:01:47| And I'm just not comfortable because I don't know what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| And I think that's where the neighbors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| And I offered that to you, actually, to postpone and for us to have a neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| I mean, it would be my 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| I'm kind of versed at it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| But I think communication is the issue where everybody gets a little confused, like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| And if they knew what was happening, and I knew what was happening, and we could all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| get on the same page and kind of work together, that's really where I was trying to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| So honestly, yeah, I'm going to pull back my original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| And I am going to make a motion to postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3744)|
| 1:02:32| You're in agreement with the pullback, Commissioner Frazier, and you are seconding the new motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| which is to postpone for 60 days, or postpone until the August zoning meeting, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3758)|
| 1:02:49| July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3769)|

| 1:04:23| Mr. Brooks, would you mind stating the recommendation on this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| The Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve PR Planned Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| Zone up to two dwelling units per acre, subject to one condition that no vehicular access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| is allowed via Caravelle Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| The F. Floodway zone will be retained by a vote of 11-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Mr. Forrester, I'll give you five minutes to speak, and then I'll listen to opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| and also allow you a brief response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| Again, Taylor Forrester here on behalf of the Property Owner Church Associates, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3897)|
| 1:05:05| This subject property is located on the Choteau Peninsula, and it's right adjacent to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| Choteau Marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| That's unique and relevant when you look at the size of the Choteau Marina and consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| the zoning on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| That has a general commercial, a CA zoning, on a large track that is commercially operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3920)|
| 1:05:27| as a marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| There's a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| There's boat slips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| There's fuel operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| There's boat slip rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| The unique situation that we have here is that the property owner in this instant request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| also owns Choteau Marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| As part of a master development idea or plan, the property owner had envisioned unifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| these developments to create a residential-type development to then serve the commercial marina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| development and vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| We talk about planned residential zoning all the time, and what always comes up, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| a lot of people complain that is oftentimes missing, is amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| What are the amenities to the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| This already has the built-in amenities for the neighborhood with the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| This development, again, can be unified, and that's what's envisioned here is to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| a unified development with the commercial development of the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| With that, there needs to be a suitable density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| That density has to be at a number that makes the numbers work with development, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| a density to then offer support to the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| Property owner would tell you that the marina during off-season definitely struggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4000)|
| 1:06:45| The restaurant struggles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| There needs to be some additional density in the area to offer that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4007)|
| 1:06:56| The request that we are asking is for planned residential at two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| We believe that's appropriate with the area when you consider, again, the CA zoning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| the surrounding zoning with PR in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| Two dwelling units is not overwhelming for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| We're talking, we've got 30 acres, but about 25 of it can be calculated for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4033)|
| 1:07:20| density, so we're looking at 50 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| The proposed layout or type of units would include townhouses down towards the waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| that could take in the waterfront views and maximize the views on those layouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| Then at the rear towards the Choteau Road, that would be traditional single-family lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4054)|
| 1:07:43| Our request with the two units per acre, we would ask with the condition on that, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| we not access Carolville Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| If we can develop at two units per acre, we can support the infrastructure costs for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| We believe that's best for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| That's what I think these people here that have concerns or are in opposition, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| primary concern is Carolville Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| With two units per acre, we can construct our own individual road off of Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4087)|
| 1:08:18| At Planning Commission, I compared this development to, if you're familiar with Duncan Boat Dock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| down in River Bend, there's a townhouse condominium development on the point of that cove there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| where Duncan Boat Dock is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| Now, Duncan Boat Dock is not commercially operated to the degree that Choteau Marina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| is, but that development results in about four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4117)|
| 1:08:45| If you're familiar with that development scene, nobody would assume that that's dense or suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| that that's dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| We submit that roads are similar, probably better in Choteau than they are at the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| of River Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| It's appropriate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| We feel it's appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| We've met with the neighbors, met with their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| We're hopeful that we would gain their support here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| Interestingly enough, the property owner that's the most impacted by any development on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| property is the property owned by Dr. Stephen Boyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| In conversations with Dr. Boyce, I've known Dr. Boyce for several years now, he's supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| of the two units per acre with the condition of no access through Caravelle, build independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4164)|
| 1:09:31| road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| As we asked for the condition as well at his request, and we think it's appropriate to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| add a 20-foot landscape buffer from the current location of the Caravelle lane down the boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4179)|

| 1:09:49| He's the closest to the development where these units would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| Again, we asked, rezone the property at PR two dwelling units per acre with the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| of no access to Caravelle lane and with the 20-foot landscape buffer from Caravelle lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| down the shared common boundary line on Dr. Boyce's property with, and I'm wrapping up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| with the condition that it's on our property, we'll maintain it, we'll install it, it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| be our obligation to see that it's maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| Dr. Boyce is here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| I don't think he necessarily wanted to speak, but maybe the commission could hear from him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| to confirm what I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| Who is speaking for opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| Mr. Sanders, are you the only speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| Come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| I'll give you five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Good evening, Madam Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| Daniel Sanders, 920 Volunteer Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| I'm here on behalf of the Channel Point Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| I have with me tonight Joseph Gimness, if you'll stand up and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| He's the president of the Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| If you are a resident of Channel Point, please stand up and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| Channel Point is essentially 34 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| These people could make it here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Obviously, they have signs, and each of these signs say no access to Caravelle lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| We are in line with the developer about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| You also have 66 petitions that are signed by, we believe, every household in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4278)|
| 1:11:27| You guys can go ahead and sit down, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| They also have children that play in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| We heard that in the last presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| 34 households, we know that a household in the county might generate 10 trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| That's about 340 trips a day that the Channel Point neighborhood generates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4305)|
| 1:11:54| As we said, the HOA in every resident, as opposed to a new higher density development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| being routed through Caravelle lane and eventually out to Choteau Road, we think the principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| of good planning mean that you don't route higher density through lower density to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| to a higher classification road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| If anything happens here and there's a rezoning, this higher density should be routed either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| through the marina or directly out to Choteau Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| What do I mean by higher density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| We did the calculations today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| Channel Point subdivision is developed at a density of less than 0.5 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4349)|
| 1:12:37| an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| To convert that, that's greater than two acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4358)|
| 1:12:44| The average size of a lot in Channel Point is more than two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| Even at one dwelling unit per acre, that would increase the traffic through their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| by 73%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| There are other cul-de-sacs, so it's really not an accurate description of what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| That would be more than 100% increase of traffic on Caravelle Lane and out to Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4383)|
| 1:13:13| Routing the construction traffic, again, it's a county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| It's going to damage the county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| You're going to have additional maintenance costs there, additional congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| This is just not a good idea, so we're in line with the developer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| The density is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| There's a difference of opinion from people in the Channel Point neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| Some are okay with two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Some are not okay with two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| There's not a consensus about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| They're not opposed to rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| They're absolutely opposed to development that would route traffic through Caravelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| But I will note that you have a letter from First Utility District, and you also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| a letter from Vice Mayor Poblen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| I tend to agree with the analysis that Vice Mayor Poblen has made about the current growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| This, I believe, is governed by the growth plan that's adopted in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4448)|
| 1:14:16| It would appear that policy 3.3 limits the density to 1.2 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4456)|
| 1:14:23| What that does to Mr. Church's development, we think whatever the density imposed or granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4463)|
| 1:14:32| here should limit access to Caravelle Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| We think the increased density would be a benefit to Mr. Church and Church Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| Anything more than the minimum lot size of one acre would seem to be a benefit, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| would allow more flexibility and a higher density, and those lots or those units could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| be clustered down near the lake where that would be an amenity for both the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| there and the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Now what he mentioned was that this is a master plan for the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| Why anybody who wants to develop a master plan and amenity for the marina would ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| think of taking traffic through another subdivision is beyond me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| So we do ask you, we think a rezoning here is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| The density is a question, but whatever you do, we want a condition that limits access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| to Caravelle Lane, and with that I'll stand for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4530)|

| 1:16:23| It's a very, very unique opportunity to support the marina and create a community that offers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4583)|
| 1:16:30| lakefront views and lakefront living, because as you know, property is extremely expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4590)|
| 1:16:37| to live on the lake or enjoy the lake, and we feel that this property is very unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| in that it will offer that in a clustered type setting along the lakefront and the marina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| front, which would support the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| So I'm in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| I live off Choteau Road, so I have kind of a mixed on this, but I am in full support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| and I think that the two units per acre is reasonable for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4627)|

| 1:17:29| preference would be to just leave everything just the way it is, but that's not the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| things work, and I would just say that we don't have a big problem with up to two units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| per acre, but we share a long property line with them, and we want to keep our privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| that we've had for 27 years, and so as long as there's no construction entrance or permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| entrance that goes through Caravelle Lane and we can have the Class A landscaping buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| between their property line and our property line, then if there's going to be a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| there, then that would be my wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4685)|

| 1:18:25| I guess maybe I'm a little confused because you guys both seem to be saying the exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| You don't want access through the Channel Point neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| You're saying we don't want to have access to the Channel Point neighborhood, we'll put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| our own road in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| You all don't want higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| They're okay with the density as this seems like a classic example of transition between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| commercial and neighborhood where you have a mix of different types of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| I guess I'm not sure what, like, is there something I'm missing that this isn't an agreeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| thing between what they want and what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| Am I missing a big sticking point here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| Your application is for two units an acre with your own road that you will not connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| to the neighborhood and that's it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| Yes, and there were discussions in a sit-down last Thursday that we thought was fruitful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| and thought was leading to an agreement amongst the parties for the support of the two units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4770)|
| 1:19:38| no access with the buffer as discussed, but we didn't end up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4778)|
| 1:19:46| Again, what am I missing, Mr. Sanders, that you said you don't want access to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| He said they're not going to do access to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| They're going to deal with their own sewer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| It's not on the responsibility of anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| We could not reach a consensus on the agreement because there were some additional conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| that we would want to impose on the development that we just weren't able to get to an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Such as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Well, we wanted a larger buffer and lower density in order to support this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4812)|
| 1:20:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Well, I mean, I'm just, nobody gets every single thing, but it seems like the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4822)|
| 1:20:29| sticking point is don't go through our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| That is the biggest sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| That is the biggest thing that everybody here has a sign about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| That is the biggest sticking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| I will tell you there are people in the neighborhood, obviously, that are okay with two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| There are people in the neighborhood that think you should follow the growth plan, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| the growth plan limits this to 1.2, and I, you're not going to ask me what you're limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4846)|
| 1:20:57| to, but I'm telling you that if I were in their shoes, and I know what might happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| next month when LGPAC approves this, you know, new growth plan says residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4864)|

| 1:21:18| You don't have that in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| You're at the end of Choteau Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| This is possibly the most rural thing that you have in the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4881)|

| 1:21:33| What could be built on there right now, as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| There could be one dwelling unit per acre, currently, as well as some other things I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| can read off the list if you'd like, but yeah, it's based on the minimum lot size, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4906)|
| 1:21:53| other things that can be done as well on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4913)|

| 1:21:59| You know, beyond residential is what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4921)|

| 1:22:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Didn't expect that last one, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4952)|
| 1:22:40| I've got some more questions, but I'm going to turn the mic over here for a second because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| I want to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| I just have one more thing to look up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| In the same vein that Commissioner Jay was in, we haven't done a lot of deeded questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Another deeded question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Do they have deeded access to their subdivision right now as it stands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| Staff please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| Do they have deeded access to the property next door that they don't want the road coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| through currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| Just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=4999)|
| 1:23:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5013)|
| 1:23:45| Commissioner Ward, based on the plot that was recorded back in 1988 when the creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| of the subdivision was made, the right of way does adjoin this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| So right now they could go out there and build one unit and an acre, access that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5036)|
| 1:24:03| and call it a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| So I think what Commissioner Jay was saying, the biggest sticking point is you guys don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| want them going through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| They don't want to go through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| Happiest thing sounds like to go forth with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| You go from CA transition into that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| I know what kind of buildings Mike's built is the nicest ones in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| So you've got like one of the best builders who builds the nicest stuff right next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| I mean, I don't know where the big contention is here either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| I'm kind of confused why we weren't able to meet in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| Sounds like a pretty good meeting spot for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| I know how they're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| They just described how they're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| It makes the sense to keep the buildings away from you guys and put it all along the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| and all along the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| That's where the view is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| That's where the money is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| There's going to be as far away from you as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| I'm cool with adding in the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| If he wants an A buffer, I believe I looked up your parcel, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| You own the parcel, the longest strip against that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| I think that's fair to ask for a barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| I don't see why we can't put that in there tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| I just don't see where the contention is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| It just makes a lot of sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| And this isn't like not building 300 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| This is not a lot of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| So that's my opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| Commissioner Ward's getting lucky tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| We've got some people agreeing with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| I actually spoke to some residents today of your guys' area that called and reached out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| And you were sitting here, so you understand I'm not for connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| And actually, the people that I talked to, I told that to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| And I also told them what the developer's willing to do is not connect if they get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5149)|
| 1:25:56| And I appreciate that the developer went out and spoke to the neighbors, because that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| happen all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| And they don't try to work with the neighbors, which is always a really good thing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| But right now, and I told some people this, you've got one acre right now for agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5166)|
| 1:26:14| that they can go ahead and go through Caravail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| And they're probably going to be doing a lot more cutting and backfilling than they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| on two, giving you the landscape buffer and not coming through Caravail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| And then, Director Moyers, as Mr. Sanders was talking about the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5188)|
| 1:26:38| I know that we had some questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| We're in a kind of a weird situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| I was informed today that the, what's it called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5204)|
| 1:26:53| The local government planning advisory committee in Nashville has to approve the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5213)|
| 1:27:00| before it becomes effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| And it turns out that that body only meets three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| And they don't meet until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| So at this point, they have not approved the growth plan yet, is what I've been informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| I haven't independently verified that, but Ms. Brooks, I believe, has, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5232)|
| 1:27:19| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| So we're in a situation where we're operating under the new general plan, but under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| old growth plan until June, when they meet to approve the plan, which they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| It's pro forma, but apparently they only meet three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| So we're operating under the old growth plan, at least right now as we sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| But under the new general plan that we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5260)|
| 1:27:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| So that kind of, I know that we all kind of had questions about that last week too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Like we were kind of in zoning purgatory for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| So I was glad that we were able to find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| So I mean, I've probably given myself away, but I'm kind of leaning towards the two units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5275)|
| 1:28:03| but with no connectivity, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| It's stated in the planning commission staff that policy 3.2 of the 2000 growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| plan limits rezoning within the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| And this is in the rural area of the growth plan up to two based on the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| determination of septic system capability, which it does not have sewage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| And you have the letter from first utility and policy 3.3 of the 2000 growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| dictates the allowable density on hillside slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| So given policy 3.2 and 3.3, the maximum density permitted by the growth plan is 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5317)|
| 1:28:49| Also when you look at the transportation network that we're dealing with in Choteau and North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| Shore, that's why we included a small area study in the comprehensive plan because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| have already reached the capacity of the recommended capacity of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| They're already at 18,000 average daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| And as we've stated, because of the topography, when you widen a road, which is all we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| do with Choteau or North Shore, you're only improving safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| You're not addressing capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| So the only option that a decision maker would have is to look at density and limiting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| number of average daily vehicle trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| So that's, those are my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5369)|
| 1:29:37| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| If I want to address Commissioner Frazier and ask, I just want to make sure I'm clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5380)|
| 1:29:48| on the 1.2 calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| Is that based on the growth plan of 2000 or would that also be true under the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| that we passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| This is based on the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| It's still given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5400)|
| 1:30:01| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5402)|
| 1:30:03| It's still the rural area in the current growth policy plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| Even if it hasn't been voted on at the state level, you're looking at a rural area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| then you have to take into consideration the septic capability, the road widths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| It all dictates your density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| So whether it's the 2000 or the current, you're still looking at 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| So 1.2 would be the calculated, is what you're saying, even under the growth plan that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| just passed, if it were effective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| Just as a follow-up, even, does that still apply Commissioner Frazier, even if the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5437)|
| 1:30:51| the development is going to put in their own sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| So septic would, I mean, it would no longer be septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| There wouldn't be the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| That would be a question for planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| I don't believe so, but the problem is we have a letter from First Utility that states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5464)|
| 1:31:11| that it's a private, it would be a private utility company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| I mean, I would defer to the district commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| I believe he's had multiple conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| He might be able to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| And Commissioner Schoonmaker, I was trying to hold you till the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| If you want to speak now and I'll circle back again, what's your preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| I'd like to make a couple of comments now if I'm allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| In reference for the First Utility district letter, each commissioner received a copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| of this prior to today's meeting and they were concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| And if you look at the last line of this letter is they just wanted to go on record that First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| Utility district is providing this letter as written notice that we will not under any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| circumstances now or in the future, assume ownership or maintenance of the proposed system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| And he's talking about what the developer is intending, including any provision for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| service of septic tanks, septic tank pumps, sewer collection systems, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| So First Utility just saying, hey, they got to handle their own solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| It's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5545)|
| 1:32:26| It's up to the HOA that's organized and they just want to have that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| So everybody has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| Mr. Snow, you haven't been addressed here in the last few minutes, which is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| But I think one of the issues on the density question is that the terminus of Chota Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5561)|
| 1:32:50| the road width is only 17 feet, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| And I appreciate you thinking of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| I don't, I haven't measured it specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| It does have center and edge line markings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| So that would lead me to believe that it's somewhere between 17 and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| So typically we don't like to put edge lines on a road until it is 18 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| So I would say there's spots that are 18, but then probably some spots that are 17 too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| So yeah, it's probably in that ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| And then the rules are for a development of this type, it has to be 18 feet or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5601)|
| 1:33:29| If you use the growth plan that was approved that may, as to Mr. Moyer's point, that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5609)|
| 1:33:36| not be adopted yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| The old growth plan, and Amy can correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think it codified a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| roadway width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| It just talked about a classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| Connecting a collector and arterial roads from the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| And since you mentioned the growth plan, you know, the one that we just passed, one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| the big stipulations was, and of course thanks to Commissioner Beeler, was this was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5641)|
| 1:34:08| the growth plan was adopted to better protect the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| This is a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| There is no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| Nobody can deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| And I think that's what the community is trying to do here is to protect the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| Also, I guess, Director Brooks, aren't we, with the old growth plan that was established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5663)|
| 1:34:33| in 2000 or the new one that hopefully will be approved next month, the growth plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| the statutory authority that we're supposed to make our decisions on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| It is the first level of planning you have here, but I will defer to Director Moyer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5684)|
| 1:34:51| if he wants to provide you with additional guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| Well, the state law on this says that once a growth plan is adopted, all of your planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5694)|
| 1:35:02| decisions, land use decisions must be consistent with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| And I think the question was, if what we adopted, the current growth plan that's under approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5708)|
| 1:35:16| process, if this, on this track land, and I think this is why the, your staff, planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5716)|
| 1:35:25| staff said one unit an acre, because that would comply with the current, or excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| the one that we just recently approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| We did have discussions about the plans that were, you know, current, that were being considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| at the time, but this particular application was evaluated with the plans that were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| effect at that time, which is the 2000 growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| And that's why the staff recommended one dwelling unit per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| It was based on a number of different factors that are outlined in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| The staff recommended one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| The planning commission decided on two dwelling units per acre, but the professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5768)|
| 1:36:16| said one dwelling unit an acre for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| And where Commissioner Frazier is using this 1.2 number, if you'll look in your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| at the bottom of page four, it's spelled out for you how that the density calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| are determined, because they have to build above the 820 contour line, which only gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5792)|
| 1:36:43| you about 25 acres to develop, and that's how it comes to 1.2 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5803)|
| 1:36:50| So if you look at the bottom of page four, you can read that, and that explains everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| about what we potentially should be making our decisions on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| So I'll defer to some of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| I think it's, you guys are right in the middle of a really interesting time, because sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| there's some commissioners that are like, use the current plan, and some commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| are like, no, use the old plan, and we are stuck in between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| I think you separate all, I think put all of that aside, and just let's keep it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| The applicant can currently, just like the whole rest of the peninsula is built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| can go and build 1.3, is that three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| 1.2 units an acre right now, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| And the way they're going to do that is they're going to put down a huge layer of gravel right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| off of Caravelle Road, and they're going to go in, and they're going to connect to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| They have all the legal rights currently to do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| You have a choice, which I think you don't want that, to say, it doesn't fit in a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5874)|
| 1:38:01| perfect box, but we're willing to give two units an acre, so they have their own road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| their own buffer, and they don't touch our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| And I think this is just the art of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| So the applicant can walk away right now and connect to your neighborhood with all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| legal rights that are afforded to every other landowner in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| They're offering not to do that and put in buffers at two units an acre, and it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| fit exactly in the old plan, it doesn't fit exactly in the new plan, but I think keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| it very simple like that, if you're high, this is a weighted decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| If you're most important, the most important thing for your neighborhood is to keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| not to be connected to your neighborhood, which I do think is very important, then take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| that deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Because otherwise you're going to have gravel on Monday morning of next week, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| just going to do a one unit an acre, and you're going to hate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| I mean, tell me, am I missing something about that they can, they could do that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| They, currently with the ag zone, they can build one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| And Mr. Snowden, they could go and put that neighborhood in tomorrow and ask for plots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| and plats and connect to the existing neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| Yes, they would have to go through planning with a concept plan, but yes, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5955)|
| 1:39:22| And they can handle their own sewer separate of first utility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5962)|
| 1:39:27| That's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| So, Mr. Sanders, what, are they not, I've got our director of engineering and our director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| of planning saying-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| We have to be very careful with the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| Under the agricultural zone, they have a right to one acre lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5979)|
| 1:39:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Plots also have to be big enough to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| They have to, there has to be certain infrastructure installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| People don't really develop agricultural subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| I get all that nuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| I really, I get all that nuance, and it may not be one unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| It may be a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| It's definitely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| It may be a very-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| That is the wrong thing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| Let me rephrase my statement, and you tell me if you disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| The applicant, under the current laws and rights, can go and put a neighborhood in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| today of whatever size-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Of a size that is legal to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| They can put in houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| They can build on this land, and they can connect to the existing neighborhood today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6028)|
| 1:40:34| Under certain conditions, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| All I'm saying, folks-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| But people don't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| All I'm saying, folks, I get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| You don't want this in your neighborhood and connected to your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| The applicant is offering a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| We'll make our own road and have a higher density that's closer to the marina that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| more buffer versus just go in there and connect to your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| So-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| That's a good deal to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| I don't understand why this is-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| You don't want the alternative to connect to your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| That's what I'm confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| It could be 1.2 and not connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| Hold on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| It could be any number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker, can you enlighten me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6075)|
| 1:41:23| I don't-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| Mr. Sanders is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| When you talk about the zoning, you can have one dwelling on one acre of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Now, the other thing is, and we go back to the statutory authority, the current growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6093)|
| 1:41:39| plan that's in place today, that's been in place for 24 years, says in this rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6099)|
| 1:41:46| the maximum density is 1.2 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| Understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| And we just all, as a combined body, unanimously passed the growth plan to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6112)|
| 1:42:03| And basically, the majority of that was to protect the rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| What we're trying to do here is protect the rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| It's not to take 25 acres and put as many houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6131)|
| 1:42:17| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| We're trying to protect the rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| And the road system doesn't even meet the county standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| Basically, drive down there and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| I understand that, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| What I'm asking is, the landowner, under whichever plan you want to pick, and whichever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6150)|
| 1:42:38| condition you want to pick, has the ability to build on their land some homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| Through, and Mr. Snowden said, they can apply to connect to that neighborhood today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| And they can deal with their own sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| And they can go through planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| And they will get all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| Because that is, they're going to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| So my point, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| But at a maximum of 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| So maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Say they put 10 houses in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| Who cares?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| My point is to the residents here, if this is a weighted decision and it doesn't fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| perfectly, if the single most important thing to them is, don't connect to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| and create a buffer, and the applicant is saying, we're only going to do that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| get two units an acre, because it's expensive to build a road, then that is a fair deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6204)|
| 1:43:31| Otherwise, the other alternative is, they're going to connect to your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| I'm just trying to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| But in your analogy of using 10 homes, okay, to connect, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| But they're asking for 60 homes to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| They don't want any homes connected to their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| Promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| None of them want to connect to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| Actually, the Channel Point subdivision, when that was developed, the guy that developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| probably shouldn't have done what he did and put that cul-de-sac on the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| And it's just one of those deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| But for us, and what we've just done recently by adopting the growth plan, we're restricted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6249)|
| 1:44:16| to 1.2 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| We can't go above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| If we're going to follow what we just passed unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| And my point is, if we follow exactly to that letter of the law, they are going to get exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6264)|
| 1:44:34| what they don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| And I'm saying that it doesn't always fit in a very single perfect box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| And we will run into this time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| And there are times where we as a legislative body should say, the most important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| is to respect the wishes of the adjoining neighbors and maybe give just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| of a tweak to the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| Because that is more important than following a plan that is almost never going to be exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6296)|
| 1:45:02| right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Unless the motion is made for 1.2 dwelling units with no connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| If that happens and that passes, then the applicant will say, we withdraw or go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| to the original plan and we'll just connect to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| I think the neighbors are not going to get what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| Which is, don't connect to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6325)|
| 1:45:34| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| I agree with everything Commissioner Jay just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| For the sewage question, what sewage system are you guys putting in that you can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6339)|
| 1:45:46| on the excess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6346)|
| 1:45:54| Robert Campbell, 7523 Pagert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| The developer is looking at doing an on-site drip field sewage system, which is regulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| by the Tennessee Regulatory Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| They regulate on-site drip fields and alternative disposal systems that are not connected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6366)|
| 1:46:13| gravity and or forced main sewer from a utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| And it can handle the two units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| We've got systems all over this, all over, well a lot, that can handle a lot, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6380)|
| 1:46:27| Are there ones already in place in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| I don't know of any in Knox County, but there may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| I know that TDEC had a push to do what they call decentralized sewer treatment because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| that didn't put as much load back on your existing treatment plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| I know they're in a lot of different counties and public utilities or utilities own, operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| and maintain those systems in several locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| Okay, so this isn't anything new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| There's actually the same design criteria that's in TDEC for pump stations, wastewater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6413)|
| 1:47:00| systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| You use that same chapter, I think it's chapter six that spells out drip field and how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| design those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| To reiterate what Commissioner Jay said, I feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| If you give them 1.2, they still need to connect to make it 2, they don't have to connect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| Commissioner, did you want to respond, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6442)|
| 1:47:31| Yeah, I just have one really small thing that I wanted to add, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6451)|
| 1:47:39| I'm trying to find a way forward that I think is the most important thing is to not connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| to the neighborhood because, and this is why I'm concerned, if you head towards that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| before this vote is taken, this applicant will stand up and say, I withdraw my application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| which will turn into a denial, and they will end up exactly where they are today, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| will start connecting to the neighborhood in a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| That's why I'm, I think moving towards a deal in which they don't connect to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| is the most important thing to do, because that is the most heavily weighted decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| And if you head towards 1.2 units an acre with no connectivity, they're going to stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| up and go, see ya, and they're going to connect to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| We don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| So that's, I just want to add that last little point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| I don't know if they'll do it, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| I just want to remind the body, we are a legislative body, and we are to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| The growth plan, the growth, and I understand what you're saying, and I understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| Commissioner Ward is saying, but a commissioner cannot negotiate away from following the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| An applicant cannot negotiate away from following the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6532)|
| 1:49:00| An opposition cannot negotiate following away from the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| We have to follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| We have to rule as the law states, and we just passed this, and you're already talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| about challenging the integrity of the process that we just went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6551)|
| 1:49:19| So we have a law that we are to follow, and we should follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| If the applicant wants to withdraw, that's within their right, but we have to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| Mr. Moores, can we put two units an acre, can we make that motion, because I know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| answer already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6583)|
| 1:49:50| I'll repeat what I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| The state statute that governs the growth plan states that once a growth plan is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| all land use planning decisions must be consistent with that growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| Now, I've not independently calculated the density that that leads us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| I don't know that Ms. Brooks has been asked or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| Planning staff certainly said one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| She said it's based on a number of considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| Commissioner Frazier, I would rarely question her figuring on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6620)|
| 1:50:28| My feeling is you have to make a decision that's consistent with the growth plan, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| right now that means consistent with the 2000 growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| If we're told that the 2000 growth plan has a maximum of 1.2 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6638)|
| 1:50:47| and we go above that, we open ourselves up to litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| Can we win it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| I'd never say absolutely, positively, 100% yes or no, because litigation is a funny thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6652)|
| 1:50:59| But I would say that if the people who understand these things, if Ms. Brooks says that under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6659)|
| 1:51:07| the 2000 growth plan, the maximum density that would be allowed in the rural zone, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| you don't have sufficient sewerage infrastructure as 1.2, then 1.2 is consistent with the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6673)|
| 1:51:21| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| With the sewage though, would it change or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| There is a higher density allowed, I believe, Ms. Brooks, if you have proper infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| Isn't there a higher density that's allowed in rural zones under those circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| Under 3.5 of the current growth policy plan, it discusses densities from 1 to 3, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| does include provision of sanitary sewer and public water services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| So when they install or if they install the sewage system-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| It's not a sewage system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| It's acceptable sewage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| It's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| Ms. Brooks, just a quick-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| Let me ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| If they install the sewage system, then does that increase the density in theory or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6721)|
| 1:52:09| If it's a private, I don't believe that this takes into consideration private systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| I think it's specific to public sanitary sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| And this 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| 3.5 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| I'm referencing the number 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| I'm referencing the growth policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| Yeah, I'm referencing the growth policy plan 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| So do we take into private systems anywhere, or is it that technology that wasn't created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| in 2000, so that's why we don't have access to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| That could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| I can't speak to whether or not it was available in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| It's 24 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| And that's kind of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| We're in this zoning purgatory right now where we're dealing with something that's 24 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6763)|
| 1:52:48| old that technology that's now have, we didn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| Well, even under the plan that you all just adopted, so I think that's why First Utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| District provided that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| If they were willing to take it on, that would be a consideration that you all could deliberate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| I think maybe I'm confused now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| I thought the whole point was for they didn't have to take it on, that it's its own private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| They're saying it was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| Because everybody else has a septic tank, and you have to have a septic tank down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| They're going to have a community septic tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| All homes would be pumped to one septic tank and one drain field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6801)|
| 1:53:27| Well, I have a couple of comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6807)|
| 1:53:44| And I'm familiar with your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| It's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| I mean, it's absolutely beautiful out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6827)|
| 1:53:55| I do tend to agree with Commissioner Jay, and let me tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6835)|
| 1:54:03| I represent Hardin Valley and Carnes, and we have seen what is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6843)|
| 1:54:21| We have seen, because maybe things didn't touch every point, that what was offered was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6861)|
| 1:54:29| not accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| And therefore, what we got, because it followed every point, was not near as good as what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6871)|
| 1:54:41| could have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6881)|
| 1:54:47| I do hear the connectivity issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6887)|
| 1:54:53| I really wish that you all would think that the potential of having even 30 houses back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6893)|
| 1:55:01| there, or whatever that might be, that will connect through that beautiful road that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6901)|
| 1:55:07| have, you will have dump trucks for the next who knows how many years going through your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6907)|
| 1:55:15| road up and down every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| And there's no telling how long that might last as that back issue gets developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6919)|
| 1:55:28| And you might think two per acre doesn't sound real good right now, but at one per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6928)|
| 1:55:36| that doesn't mean one big beautiful home per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| There are other things that can go on that 1.2 per acre that may not make you real happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6941)|
| 1:55:50| either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| So I'm kind of, okay, you've got this bird in the hand, and it's not a bad bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6951)|
| 1:56:00| It might not be exactly what you want, but it's pretty sweet because in the end, it pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6960)|
| 1:56:07| well avoids you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| It avoids you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| It stays out of your way, and it gives you plenty of buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| So that really makes me lean toward what this clearly very responsible developer is willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6976)|
| 1:56:24| to give and to do to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| So that is very much my leaning on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6987)|
| 1:56:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| I'm prepared to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| I make a motion that we approve the planned residential zone with a density up to 1.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=6999)|
| 1:56:48| dwelling units per acre on the condition that any new development on the property will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7008)|
| 1:56:55| access Carvel Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| Access will be provided either to Choteau Road or to Choteau Marina Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7017)|
| 1:57:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| We have a motion on the floor by Schoonmaker, second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7025)|
| 1:57:11| Is there any further discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| I'll let Jay go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| I wanted to hear from the applicant before, but I'll let him speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| I just have a question for Commissioner Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| Sorry, I just demoted you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7047)|
| 1:57:34| I consider it a great honor, Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| If we can put, is that motion legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| Well, yeah, of course it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| Why would it not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| I'm just saying, it's a conditional- It's a proper motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| It's a proper motion with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7074)|
| 1:57:55| So if that is legal, why is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| You talked about if the conditions were put on it, we would be open to litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7079)|
| 1:58:08| That wasn't the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| The problem was the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| The growth plan doesn't speak to conditions or the conditions you place on a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7091)|
| 1:58:17| The problem was the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| I'm being told, like I said, again, I haven't confirmed this myself, but I hear from Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7099)|
| 1:58:26| Brooks that 1.2 is the maximum that would be allowed under the 2000 growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7106)|
| 1:58:33| Then if you go over that, it can become a problem if somebody wants to make it a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7113)|
| 1:58:40| Now that is dependent, to speak to something that Commissioner Ward said, that is dependent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7120)|
| 1:58:49| on what the definition of sanitary sewer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| Now I don't know, as I sit here, whether the growth plan defines that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7133)|
| 1:59:00| A sewer basically is a series of pipes that leads to a treatment facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| I don't understand the technology that the engineer was talking about, but if the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7145)|
| 1:59:13| were to find that that system meets the definition of the term sanitary sewer, if that term is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7153)|
| 1:59:22| not otherwise defined within the growth plan, then the commission could find that that higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| density that's allowed where you have public water and sanitary sewer could be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7168)|
| 1:59:34| Now that's, again, I don't have the growth plan in front of me, and I don't know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7174)|
| 1:59:39| that term, Amy, do you know whether the term sanitary sewer is defined in the growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7179)|
| 1:59:47| I don't believe that that term is defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| If we are talking about a new technology that did not exist in 2000, then this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7191)|
| 1:59:58| can look at that technology and decide for itself whether it constitutes a sanitary sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7198)|
| 2:00:04| If the commission were to find that's the case, Daniel, step in, as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| Is it defined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| If you read a little bit further down the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| I'm not reading anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| Section 3.5, where it talks about sanitary sewers, the intent of the section to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| extensions of low-density residential development into rural areas when urban services, sanitary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7221)|
| 2:00:28| sewer water, and adequate roads become available, it clearly to me indicates that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7228)|
| 2:00:36| So that does seem to suggest that it has to be what would traditionally be known as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7236)|
| 2:00:41| sanitary sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| You know, it is problematic when we develop new technologies, but that does seem to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| about extensions from existing sanitary sewers as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7249)|
| 2:00:54| We ran the same thing with Thunder Mountain a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| So you know, without sanitary sewer, you are, under the 2000 growth plan, under a lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7258)|
| 2:01:08| density requirement than you are with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| And that's just where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| I would like to hear from the applicant too, but I think that's where you're heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| Thank you, Mr.-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| That's where I was going first, and then I have an afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7280)|
| 2:01:31| I just want to know what your thoughts are on the conversation so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| Where are you guys at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| Because right now you're at 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| Okay, so the section 3.3 of the growth policy plan, I agree that the statute does say it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7298)|
| 2:01:46| has to be consistent, or shall be consistent, land use decisions shall be consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7306)|
| 2:01:52| the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| The statute regarding general plans says land use decisions shall be consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| general plan, the general comprehensive land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| So case law has addressed this, specifically a case out of Knox County, Benson versus Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7321)|
| 2:02:08| County, where it dealt with the consistency aspect, and it was on the comprehensive land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| And the consistency was how it had been applied by the local planning body, the local legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7334)|
| 2:02:20| body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7340)|
| 2:02:21| And so although there were comments and plan requirements that you not develop on certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| hillsides, certain slopes, you stay away from them, it had been reflected over years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| that that had not been applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| It was inconsistent to apply that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| And where I'm going with is, literally a few months ago, and Commissioner Hill, I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| you remember this, because it was in the Nature's Best Organics property, it was a large, large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7364)|
| 2:02:50| tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| It's a little shot of 200 acres, and you know, someone interested, or shocked to see it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7371)|
| 2:02:58| our staff report that it specifically identified the Section 3.3, because this one was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7378)|
| 2:03:03| a month before ours, that had the similar characteristics that ours had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| There was no reference to Section 3.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| That property, other than size, was completely comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| Local area of the growth plan, it had to get a sector plan from ag to rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7397)|
| 2:03:25| and then PR, it applied for three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| And so, the recommendation was three units per acre, subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| And that that condition was, the staff recommendation was consistent to three dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7413)|
| 2:03:40| acre, because it is consistent with the growth policy plan guidelines, subject to one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7420)|
| 2:03:47| non-disturbance of slopes greater than 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| That property, of the 190 some odd acres, the slopes, as we've talked about here under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7430)|
| 2:03:56| the Section 3.3, 15 to 25%, close to 50 acres of that was sloped 15 to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7436)|
| 2:04:05| That was calculated at the density under the Hillside Guidelines calculations, given two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7445)|
| 2:04:12| units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| That's obviously more than what's been referenced here under Section 3.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7454)|

| 2:04:23| So again, very comparable property from the sense of the slope, the analysis of the 3.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7463)|
| 2:04:31| the limitations that are being relied on or cited to here, were not applied there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7471)|
| 2:04:38| Therefore, applying Benson v. Knox County in this consistency requirement, is yes, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| has to be consistent, but it also has to be consistently applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| And when it hasn't been consistently applied, you know, you apply it, it gets applied as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7486)|
| 2:04:54| how it has been applied over the years, and that's what the Court of Appeals held in Benson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| v. Knox County when dealing with hillside protection, slope, and ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| So we submit that it does satisfy the statutory definition that it be consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7504)|
| 2:05:11| growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7511)|

| 2:05:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| But consistent is consistent, and this is consistent, it's consistently been applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| this way over the years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| I don't know if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| It kind of does, to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7529)|
| 2:05:34| I'm going to make a substitute motion, I'm going to make a substitute motion, 1.9 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7534)|

| 2:05:54| Okay, your motion is 1.9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7554)|
| 2:06:07| And the buffer as well, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| 1.9 units an acre, PR zone, buffer against the other neighborhood, no access to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7569)|

| 2:06:21| All right, I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7581)|
| 2:06:33| So we have a substitute motion on the floor made by Ward seconded by Hill at 1.9 per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7593)|
| 2:06:44| the buffer as previously stated, and no access, or access only from Choteau Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7604)|

| 2:06:54| And the Marina, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| I believe we probably will, oh, do we have discussion on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7618)|
| 2:07:03| I do, I'm sorry, I just, I have to ask, Mr. Moyers, is that, in your opinion, substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7623)|
| 2:07:12| motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| Open it up to direct litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| I mean, given the discussion about sewer and everything, I just, I'm trying to get a clarifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7640)|
| 2:07:25| question, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| I'm somewhat, I'm passingly familiar with the Benson case, I don't have it right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| front of me right now, I don't know whether Benson involved the provision of sewerage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| services and the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| You know, zoning is a legislative act, you have some discretion within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7660)|
| 2:07:47| The word consistent is kind of a slippery word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| You know, I've told you what the state requirements are, you've been told what, under the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7672)|
| 2:07:59| plan, the max, the max is to be the planning commission, which is put in place to analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7679)|
| 2:08:07| these things, found two was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7687)|
| 2:08:13| You know, I don't want to sit here and say absolutely you can't do that, because if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7693)|
| 2:08:22| go ahead and do it, I'm going to have to defend that in court, and it's going to look kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| of silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| So I try to stay away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| I'm sorry to put you in that position, it's difficult because sometimes the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7709)|
| 2:08:33| says you're the legislative body, you can do whatever you want, and sometimes they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| You are the legislative body, and this is a legislative decision, but you have to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7718)|
| 2:08:45| within certain guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| It's, you know, we are constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| Zoning is completely a power that's created by the state legislature, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| In the absence of the state law, we would have no authority to do any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7736)|
| 2:09:01| I live in a community that was a result of something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7741)|
| 2:09:06| So the state gives us certain authority, but it also puts limitations on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7746)|
| 2:09:11| The growth plan law is one of those limitations, and the general plan is one of those limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7751)|
| 2:09:20| although the general plan is generally speaking more advisory in nature than the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7767)|
| 2:09:28| The general plan speaks in terms of limits, where the general plan, generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7768)|
| 2:09:36| is more aspirational and speaks in terms of recommendations and should-bes and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| like that, which is why when it's come down to it, Director Brooks has often said we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7780)|
| 2:09:48| going to use this number because that's the number that's required by the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| or limited by the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| So that's what we follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| Can I say as a matter of law that two is not consistent with a plan that says 1.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| Again, it depends on what consistent means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| I know that sounds like a lawyer talking, but that's the way the law works, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7812)|
| 2:10:19| know that consistent means equivalent to or bound by or limited by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| These are the decisions you guys have to make, and whatever decision you make, if litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| follows, we'll defend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| I'm just not going to tell you you cannot do a thing, because it is your decision to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7832)|
| 2:10:38| make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| I've just told you what the rules seem to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7844)|
| 2:10:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| Because you mentioned the growth plan, under today's standards, like you said, it's 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7855)|
| 2:11:02| If we took a 30-day postponement and the state approves it in June, then they would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| to have one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| Thanks to the work that Richie Beeler did to protect the rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7883)|

| 2:11:32| Everything around it is one unit an acre, rural agriculture, except for one piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7892)|
| 2:11:37| property, which is directly adjacent to this, to the boat dock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| That's four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| Same situation as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| Same thing happened when that was passed many, many moons ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| They made a decision then to change it, and it's been changed to four units an acre, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| it's been there ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7914)|
| 2:11:55| I think the difference...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| I was just going to ask you, do you remember how many moons that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| Many moons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| Was it more than 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| It might be more than 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| Because again, until 2000-2001, we weren't bound by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| I'll just say as an aside, the whole growth plan law was really more about restricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7929)|
| 2:12:15| annexation than it was about actual land use planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7935)|
| 2:12:18| I understand that part, but also we don't have the technology today that we had 24 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7938)|
| 2:12:24| ago as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| That's part of the thing you've got to take into consideration when making this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| When they say in court, why did you make this decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| Well, this is why I made the decision, because the technology is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| As already President said, it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7954)|
| 2:12:36| It's what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| It's what is going to give the builder the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| It just makes the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| It's the most common sense solution to this whole entire situation, in my personal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| which might be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| Very well could be wrong, but in my opinion, it makes the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| All right, seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7972)|
| 2:13:01| We have a substitute motion on the floor for 1.9 with caveats that are mentioned, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7981)|
| 2:13:10| but the main components are 1.9 per acre with no access through Caravelle Road and, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=7990)|
| 2:13:26| the existing proposed buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8011)|

| 2:20:16| A very understanding group, and I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| I was a little out of commission with a, I had an accident and then my husband was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| through cancer treatment, so I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| Trying to close on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| I do see a typo error in the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| 1009 Mabry Hood Road should not be rezoned in this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| So the request is for 10105 Dutchtown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8438)|
| 2:20:44| Part of the rezoning is for the purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| Michael Allen wants to purchase it and had requested it to be rezoned for office use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8447)|
| 2:20:55| OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| The other portion of it should never have been entered into the request, and I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| for not catching that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| Part of the issue also with getting this rezoned and waiting on my surveyor to get a line moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8464)|
| 2:21:10| is because neither one of these properties had a septic on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8470)|
| 2:21:16| So these were built, the house on Mabry Hood Road was built so long ago that they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8476)|
| 2:21:21| have it on record, and the same scenario with the, what was an existing house on Dutchtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8481)|
| 2:21:27| Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8487)|
| 2:21:28| It was torn down probably, I think, about 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8488)|
| 2:21:32| The fire department used it as a training exercise, but again, there was no septic on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| Mr. Rochette, or Roche, is my soil scientist, and he has requested for me to have the surveyor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8498)|
| 2:21:46| move one of the lines about 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| So that gives the Dutchtown Road property 1.4 acres, which I think meets the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8509)|
| 2:21:57| for the rezoning, and again, it will end up being about three-quarters of an acre for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| the Mabry Hood Road, which needs to remain residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| It needs to stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| So that is pretty much it for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8529)|
| 2:22:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| Are there any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8536)|
| 2:22:19| Seeing no lights, Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| It's so nice to meet you personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| Yeah, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| You guys have been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| This is a very interesting learning process, and I'm sure I'll have a learning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8553)|
| 2:22:34| So I wish they took the growth plan as seriously as they did here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8554)|
| 2:22:38| So we're seeing, obviously, very intense growth there, and I do flip houses, and I'm building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8558)|
| 2:22:44| houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8564)|
| 2:22:45| So it's an interesting place to be growing in that sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8565)|
| 2:22:52| It's a learning curve for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| You can tell we learn on the job tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| So I'm going to make this pretty quick and easy for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8577)|
| 2:23:03| My motion is to approve the OB and TO zone, because it is consistent with the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8583)|
| 2:23:10| and surrounding development on 10105 Dutchtown Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8590)|
| 2:23:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8595)|
| 2:23:16| Motion by Oster, second by Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8596)|
| 2:23:23| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520-zoning?start=8603)|
