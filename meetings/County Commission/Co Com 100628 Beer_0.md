| 0:02:21| Maria D. Garcia, L. Ray, 3515 West Emory Road, on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| Deferred application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| Good afternoon, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| My name is Maria Dolores Garcia, and my business address is 3515 West Emory Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=157)|
| 0:02:46| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Before we get involved with your application, you did go before the Board of Zoning Appeals to get a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Now, the original paperwork I have before me reads 3507.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| That was corrected to 3515.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| And can that be verified, Mr. Rosenberg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Just so the commission knows, there was an issue as to whether or not this was a valid variance, and it appears from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| documentation I received and also speaking, Mr. Rosenberg, that this is a valid variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| And as such, we can proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| Ma'am, I'm going to ask you a series of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=201)|

| 0:04:02| And are you leasing or renting from him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=242)|

| 0:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=245)|

| 0:04:09| I'm sole proprietor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| And will you also operate the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=251)|

| 0:04:14| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=254)|

| 0:04:25| You need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| You realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Prior to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| I had one from like five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| That was for five years, but it's already going to expire in August, so I have to redo another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| I'm now going to talk to our departments to see if there's any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Beer board inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| Mr. Law Director, she applied in 07 for a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| The board turned her down, told her she'd have to get a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| And she didn't even go to get her certified address until I believe the 10th of last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=298)|
| 0:05:09| Our address back then was 3515 East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=309)|
| 0:05:19| And then somebody has corrected the address from 3507 to 3515,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=319)|
| 0:05:31| which they ought to get a certified copy out of the code's office on a correct address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| before they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| That's all I've got to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| It don't suit me at all, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Someone want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| Mr. Law Director, this variance, if I remember right, we turned this down the first time because it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=365)|
| 0:06:13| it actually shared a parking lot with a daycare center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| Ma'am, is that daycare center still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| It is still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Do we have anyone here from the daycare center today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Ma'am, would you like to come up to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| You took the oath, correct, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| Okay, please state your name for the record and your business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| Aaron Presley, 3519 West Emery Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Do you all still have concerns about this location for a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| I remember you all did last time they applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Have you all resolved that or found some compromise, or would you still be opposing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| We've come up with a compromise as long as they don't serve when I'm open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| I don't care if they serve in the evenings or on the weekends or any time I'm closed for a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| I don't know if you can do that, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Well, we don't have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| Now, if you trust this business and you trust them, all you have is their word that they'll not do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=427)|
| 0:07:16| because we don't have the power to regulate times unless we regulate them countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=436)|
| 0:07:24| We can't say for one business you can serve it now, but you can't serve it at a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| So if we grant this license, she will be legally able to serve beer all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| Now, she can choose not to, based on a good faith agreement with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| Do you trust this vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=461)|
| 0:07:49| I don't know if that's a fair question to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Are you okay with there not being any legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| If they were serving it, is there any way that I could go back and appeal it if we come up to an agreement or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| No, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| There's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| It's all or nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| What are your hours of operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Six thirty to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| I mean, I'll tell you, I've eaten in this restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| The food is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| It seems to be the kind of place that's going to serve more beer with meals in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=502)|
| 0:08:30| I don't think a lot of folks go out and drink beer for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| But, you know, I mean, I just want you to know if I make the motion to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| that, you know, that we don't have the legal authority to restrict hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| All we have the legal authority to do is grant the grant permission or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| But, I mean, if I was in your position and, you know, my best guess would be is that they're probably not going to sell a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=529)|
| 0:08:59| whole lot of beer during lunchtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| But I just want you to know if I make the motion to approve, there is nothing to legally enforce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=541)|
| 0:09:08| Now, you could probably sign some sort of a civil contract that, you know, where you could maybe sue in civil court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| But that would be an awful lot of trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| You know, but it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| I'll make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| But, you know, just know that you'll have a good faith agreement and not a legally binding agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| I haven't made the motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| I'm waiting on this young lady to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| I thought you said I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| No, I said if I make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Mr. Law Director, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Is there anything in state law that we can deny this permit because of a daycare center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=583)|
| 0:09:53| No, sir, that's not the one of our criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| The only criterion you have in your code is 500 feet from an agricultural or residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| and that was cured by the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| That being the case, then, correct me if I'm wrong, we have no authority to deny this license as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| as they meet the regulations that set forth by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| That and your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| I think what Commissioner Lambert was trying to explain just that, that if it's granted, it's granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| The hours are established in your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| And those are the hours where she can legally sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| If they want to come to some kind of personal agreement, it's unenforceable by at least this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| But it would be unlawful for us to turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| Because of the daycare there, because state law says that we have to grant a bureau license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| Now, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| A bureau license to anyone that applies for it as long as they meet the state criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| If you denied it just on that grounds that it's in proximity to a daycare and we had to go to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| the first thing the court will ask is show me a county or state law that prohibits this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| We would say there's none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| And most likely cost would be taxed against the county for making the court go through that administrative hoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| Mr. Lambert, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| She's given me the nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| I'll make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=684)|

| 0:12:01| You took the oath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=721)|

| 0:12:18| Has beer been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=738)|

| 0:12:59| and do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=779)|

| 0:15:16| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Health Department, there are several critical violations that need to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| We're just awaiting them to go through the permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| And it's a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| Complete the building and acquire a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| How soon do we think these will be completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| Whenever they get them done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| When they call us back for the follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Sir, can you enlighten the commission as to the status of this store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Because obviously they don't want to issue a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| It's something that's still in the construction phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| The building's finished construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Walgreens is taking over the set-up of the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=952)|

| 0:16:07| Normally we approve these permits pending these things will be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=973)|

| 0:17:04| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| And you're here for an application for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| And we're going to need your certificate of registration and your business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| And that will be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| You'll need to turn to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1034)|

| 0:17:32| To my knowledge, yes, previous ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| Are you aware of the status of the any licenses or an outstanding license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| It was closed down since November, empty building, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| It was informed by the clerk that it has been surrendered, so we won't bother you any further on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| This is for off-premises only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1070)|

| 0:17:55| And is you in a rental situation or lease with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Who else has an interest in this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Only myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| So you're a sole proprietor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| And then obviously you and or an employee will operate the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| I'm going to defer to staff, health department, sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| I'd just like to mention that myself and Whoopi, we've written the last three owners about six citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| at that one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Of course, this is a new owner, but it seems to me like this spot is not close to anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| and it's evidently easy for younger people to go in and buy beer there at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| Sir, that's code four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| You're on notice and they're watching you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1125)|

| 0:18:50| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| I'll defer to the commission, but please tell the commission what is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| Just some maintenance items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Exit sign was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| We need to service the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| Saw panel on the breaker box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Yes, Jerry, I just want to mention what the sheriff's department has told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| I've been out there for over 30 years and have seen that stop in there from time to time myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| And the last owners have really had a timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| They're going to check you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| So just be ready to run a first-class operation and you'll do great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| So I wish you the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| I'll go ahead and make a motion to approve per pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| I have a motion and probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Nothing further before the commission, sir, on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Is there anything else that needs to come before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| In the current budget crunch, the Metropolitan Drug Commission's budget was cut by half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1199)|
| 0:20:10| I would like to throw this out for consideration now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| and I would like to ask our law director to set us up a resolution for the next commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| meaning that any fines that this body, the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| imposes that those fines be directed to the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| for educational purposes to keep them from coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| So that's what I would like to do, and I will be talking to Mr. Jerrod about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| If anybody else has any comment on it, I'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| Where do those fines go now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Just to the general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| They go to the general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| So, I mean, that's something that we're going to have to ask, I think, John Troyer about it as well as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| if he's expecting X number of dollars to be generated out of these fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| and how would that affect the rest of the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| So it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| That could already be set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| It has to go to the general fund too, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| Yeah, we need to know if that's what state law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Here's another thing I would like to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Don't these people pay for these classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| When they go to them, don't they have to pay for their employees and everybody to take the class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| So, I mean, you know, I don't know how this money is going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| Well, we're not talking about a king's ransom here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| I understand, but I just don't understand how it's going to help if they're paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| I'm not saying it's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| I just think those are some things, the concerns that I have that we'd have to answer before we could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| move those fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| If it's $1,000 or $5,000, anything we can do to put in for education to prevent this problem, I think it's well worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| We're worth looking into, so we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100628beer?start=1314)|
