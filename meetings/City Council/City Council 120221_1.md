| 2:48:55| Certainly will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10135)|
| 2:48:56| They've spent nearly $400,000 to date in reliance on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10136)|
| 2:49:02| More and more people who come to Gentry Griffey to have their funeral services provided for them are asking for cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10142)|
| 2:49:13| Every other funeral home in town advertises crematory services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10153)|
| 2:49:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| And we need to, I submit, Your Honor, get this matter resolved tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10161)|
| 2:49:31| Well, I agree with you getting it resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| But most of the funeral homes in this city, they're not performing crematoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10173)|
| 2:49:38| Well, they own a crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| You send them out or whatever they do, but they're not doing them on the premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10180)|
| 2:49:45| They're not doing them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| So they're able to exist and make a profit as they have been doing all of these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10187)|
| 2:49:53| So, I mean, I'm not, as the young people say, I'm not feeling that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10193)|
| 2:50:02| And I think that we really should go ahead and I don't see a 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10202)|
| 2:50:08| We're going to be right back where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| So I think this body is called upon to go ahead and make some decisions tonight, one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10211)|
| 2:50:19| So I hope that we go ahead and vote and solve this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10219)|
| 2:50:23| More and more I think of the number of crematories in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10223)|
| 2:50:28| If you remember the movie Four Weddings and a Funeral, you remember that movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10228)|
| 2:50:36| They had right there at the funeral home with the family and friends gathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10236)|
| 2:50:44| That's the type of service a lot of people are going to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10244)|
| 2:50:49| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10249)|
| 2:50:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10250)|
| 2:50:51| We've heard a lot of comments tonight from people who are very passionate on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10251)|
| 2:50:56| There's a lot of emotion involved in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| I respect the comments of my colleagues and the people who have spoken on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10260)|
| 2:51:06| I do want to go back to something that Councilman Starr said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10266)|
| 2:51:10| and that is the real issue that we need to be deciding tonight and the legal ramifications of a decision that we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10270)|
| 2:51:18| If we approve this appeal, I'm very confident that Gentry Griffey will be in court before the end of this week to appeal our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10278)|
| 2:51:29| Case law would not support a successful defense by Councilman or, I mean, by Attorney Frost in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10289)|
| 2:51:40| We could wait 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| We could wait 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10302)|
| 2:51:43| We could wait three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10303)|
| 2:51:45| We would still be at the same point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| When we're elected to office, actually I was talking to someone about this the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10307)|
| 2:51:53| When I ran for office two and a half years ago, I never thought we would be discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10313)|
| 2:52:02| So I think we need to vote tonight, and I think we need to take the advice of Lawyer Frost that we have a legal issue to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10322)|
| 2:52:19| Did the inspector follow the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10339)|
| 2:52:26| And if so, then we don't have a choice other than to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10346)|
| 2:52:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10351)|
| 2:52:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10352)|
| 2:52:33| Just so you know, the motion to postpone died for a lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10353)|
| 2:52:41| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10361)|
| 2:52:44| Yes, well, this is welcome to City Council, new members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10364)|
| 2:52:50| This is what you all decided you wanted to do, so this is fun and games here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10370)|
| 2:52:55| But, you know, I appreciate what Councilwoman Palmer and some of them said about the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10375)|
| 2:53:03| But in my mind, I still think there's a question about this being issued to the best of their ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10383)|
| 2:53:13| They gave this permit or proved it the best of their ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10393)|
| 2:53:20| And, you know, I think there's a little gray area there in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10400)|
| 2:53:25| I'm not an attorney, but my mom and dad gave me a little bit of walking around sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10405)|
| 2:53:30| And, you know, I think there's something there that we need to look at further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10410)|
| 2:53:35| I also have a concern about this becoming the primary use as opposed to the accessory use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10415)|
| 2:53:42| which is how, you know, what it's called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10422)|
| 2:53:46| And on the issue of the courts, you know, I'm not an attorney, but I think things have been overturned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10426)|
| 2:53:55| And, you know, and I'll say this at the risk of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10435)|
| 2:53:59| even if we were charged with having to pay attorneys a fee, the attorneys a fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10439)|
| 2:54:05| So, you know, it wouldn't be the first time, probably won't be the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10445)|
| 2:54:09| Let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10449)|
| 2:54:10| The amount of money that is invested in that community, in and around this funeral home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10450)|
| 2:54:17| the amount of property values, quality of life is just, you know, mammoth to what that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10457)|
| 2:54:28| And I'm willing to take a gamble on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10468)|
| 2:54:30| I think that it's time that we step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10470)|
| 2:54:36| I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10476)|
| 2:54:37| And I hope we can just move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| I think there's been enough debate on it this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| I don't know what else we could say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10483)|
| 2:54:46| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10486)|
| 2:54:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10487)|
| 2:54:48| Councilman, don't revoke me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10488)|
| 2:54:49| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10489)|
| 2:54:50| We really have aired it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10490)|
| 2:54:51| And I know that both sides have a lot invested in not only the arguments, but the activity itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10491)|
| 2:54:58| and whether their neighborhood is affected or not, whether it's the fear of something that's unknown or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10498)|
| 2:55:03| Those are questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| And certainly the investment of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| They tried to find out whether or not this thing could be permitted at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10507)|
| 2:55:13| I've got two things that I want to submit to the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| and also answer something that was raised about one of the legal questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| One is Mr. Tim Williams was good enough to give me a note that his architect had prepared just before the BZA hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10520)|
| 2:55:30| where he was trying to relate the time frame of when things happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10530)|
| 2:55:34| And there's two things I want to call your attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| There's other information, and it goes both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| But one is that he said that Gary through his office, Gary being the building official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10538)|
| 2:55:45| confirmed through his office that cremation services would be allowed as an O1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10545)|
| 2:55:50| as an accessory used to a funeral home, although I never received a written confirmation I requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10550)|
| 2:55:58| Then he talks about how he talked and met with Charlie Wilson of the building department and others there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10558)|
| 2:56:04| and no one ever raised the appropriateness of the land use in the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10564)|
| 2:56:10| They were down to talking about foundations and construction stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10570)|
| 2:56:14| and where you put the rebar and how tall is the stack and how far from the boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10574)|
| 2:56:18| and all the kinds of things you do in normal building construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10578)|
| 2:56:22| And if you look at the notes that's in the file, that's what they were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10582)|
| 2:56:26| The second thing in here is that Mr. Reynolds, he quotes, says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10586)|
| 2:56:30| some months later Tom and I discussed this issue informally on the phone after it arose in the public arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10590)|
| 2:56:37| He related to me that he would likely not have made the same interpretation as Gary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10597)|
| 2:56:41| but that was the decision that had been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10601)|
| 2:56:44| So I'm going to pass that up and ask that that be added to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| And in addition, I have some documents copied at the Knox County Air Pollution Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| And there's a couple things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| One of them is what comes out of the stack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10615)|
| 2:56:59| And you have to understand this is the permit to construct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| There is no permit to operate yet that has not yet been issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10622)|
| 2:57:05| But in that there are conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| And one is that they maintain temperatures at 1,600 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| That's just how hot it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| That's the temperature they're supposed to burn at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10633)|
| 2:57:15| And that they keep records of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10635)|
| 2:57:17| That they have continuous temperature monitoring and a recording device to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10637)|
| 2:57:21| That they have a visible emission alarm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10641)|
| 2:57:24| And this is this thing called opacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| They put a light through the stack and it measures how much of the light is obscured by the darkness of the smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10646)|
| 2:57:33| And under the permit you're limited to like 20% opacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| So there's something that measures it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| When it exceeds that, an alarm goes off and they're supposed to document that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| And there's a recording device that saves that and makes a log or a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10663)|
| 2:57:47| And then they have to have a daily log of operating hours and the number of bodies cremated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10667)|
| 2:57:51| And all those records are kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| And that's what they come and inspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| And I asked specifically to Mr. William Schott, who is the engineer that supervised this permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10675)|
| 2:58:00| and he said, no, we don't do any stack monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| No, we don't look at any of those things after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| We check the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10686)|
| 2:58:07| If there's a complaint, we'll go out and look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| But they did have some calculations in their file prepared in looking at the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10689)|
| 2:58:15| And I wanted to point these out to you, too, and then I'll pass the whole thing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10695)|
| 2:58:18| You can look at it or stick it in the record, whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| But for particulates, those are the particle-y things that come out of the stack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10700)|
| 2:58:26| They will release at the calculation rate that he used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10706)|
| 2:58:30| And, of course, he had to take their word for granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10710)|
| 2:58:35| In other words, it runs 16 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10715)|
| 2:58:37| It will run seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| It will run 365 days a year because that's what they wrote in the permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10719)|
| 2:58:45| And he comes up with 1.53 tons of particulates per year will come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10725)|
| 2:58:53| 1.17 tons of NOx, nitrous oxides, will come out, virtually a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10733)|
| 2:59:00| It was 0.97 tons of CO, carbon monoxide, I guess, would come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10740)|
| 2:59:06| SO2, there would be 0.71 tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10746)|
| 2:59:09| VOC, those are volatile things that come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| And, of course, you know if you stick a body in there and you burn plastic or something else, some clothing or stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10753)|
| 2:59:18| you will make chlorine, you might make furans, you might make other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10758)|
| 2:59:21| These volatiles that come out, that's a lesser amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| That's only 0.1 ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| And then HAP, hazardous pollution, 0.35 tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| So they did some estimating of the stuff that comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10771)|
| 2:59:34| In the air pollution world, and I'll pass this up, in the air pollution world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10774)|
| 2:59:38| they are looking first at major sources of pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10778)|
| 2:59:43| things that put out like 100 tons a year, power plants and factories and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10783)|
| 2:59:48| And these little furnaces are not given the same level of scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10788)|
| 2:59:54| And so they get kind of a gentle loving permit and some operating parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10794)|
| 2:59:58| But they're really looking at temperature and opacity of the particulates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10798)|
| 3:00:02| They're not measuring those other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| There is an interesting aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| There's another note in here, and it was a note by Mr. Eric Botts to William Schott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| who asked specifically, as he was doing his calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10810)|
| 3:00:13| tell me what steps you take to operate the crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10813)|
| 3:00:17| And he lists six things, and basically you get it up to temp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10817)|
| 3:00:21| That's the first three points before you load the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10821)|
| 3:00:24| Number four, the cremation door is open, the body is loaded, the chamber door is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10824)|
| 3:00:28| Number five, it's 1,650 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| The cremation flame ignites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| The cremation air is turned on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| And number six, the cremation process commences in a duration of three hours, as typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10835)|
| 3:00:40| Now, why do I mention that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10840)|
| 3:00:42| I was sitting there talking to this guy, and we were talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| trying to understand scientific numbers, and I'm no scientist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10844)|
| 3:00:47| I mean, just write me off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| I've been around stuff like that, but I ain't going to pass no test to be a scientist or a chemist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10849)|
| 3:00:54| But one of the things that surprised me was he got a little bug-eyed when I told him what I saw in Maryville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10854)|
| 3:01:00| and that is that the process is not all contained in this little box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10860)|
| 3:01:05| and it all happens magically without disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| Somewhere through the burning process, they open the door to the crematory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10868)|
| 3:01:13| and they put a long-handled rake-type thing in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| and they drag it forward because they're trying to get everything to burn, if they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10876)|
| 3:01:20| The bones don't disintegrate, but everything that will burn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10880)|
| 3:01:24| And, of course, there's this puddle of fat, because we're all fat, especially me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10884)|
| 3:01:27| I'd be even fatter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10887)|
| 3:01:28| But you stir this up, and a couple of things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10888)|
| 3:01:32| That's when the smoke comes out, and they have up to six minutes of excursion per hour to allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10892)|
| 3:01:38| And one of the things that he was surprised at, it wasn't in the list of things about how it's operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10898)|
| 3:01:45| He said he would have to inquire into that further, and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10905)|
| 3:01:48| Well, the operator told me she had done that for 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10908)|
| 3:01:51| She's the operator down there, a lady named Helen Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| And that's how they do it, and they do it with every cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10914)|
| 3:01:57| And there are variations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10917)|
| 3:01:58| It's an art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10918)|
| 3:01:59| It's not a science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10919)|
| 3:02:00| But you stir this thing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| You let fresh air blow through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10922)|
| 3:02:04| And understand how this thing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10924)|
| 3:02:05| I know enough about it to know that as you're burning the body in the incinerator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10925)|
| 3:02:09| you then take the air through this retort of this another chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10929)|
| 3:02:13| and you put more heat to it and try to burn the other stuff up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10933)|
| 3:02:16| I mean, it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10936)|
| 3:02:17| You have a second chamber so that you burn the stuff on the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10937)|
| 3:02:20| But when you open that door, all kinds of cold air gets sucked in by the heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10940)|
| 3:02:25| I mean, it's a chimney effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10945)|
| 3:02:26| And you blast that stuff out of the furnace, and that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10946)|
| 3:02:29| And I guess he wasn't even aware, because they have never permitted one of these in Knox County, that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10949)|
| 3:02:36| I mean, so I think that's interesting in this permit information, and I'll pass that up to Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10956)|
| 3:02:42| Last point, and I'll shush up because it's a very hard decision we have to make here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10962)|
| 3:02:46| When you look at the cases like BMC, there's one thing that's really important to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| and I don't think my brother Marshall Stair mentioned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10970)|
| 3:02:52| but the court was talking about a theoretical permit application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10972)|
| 3:02:57| and they're reciting the facts in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10977)|
| 3:02:59| And one of the things they say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10979)|
| 3:03:00| a stack extending three feet above the roof will vent only heat out of the crematory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10980)|
| 3:03:06| and the crematory would operate without releasing smoke or odor into the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10986)|
| 3:03:11| That's one of the factual things that they were working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| This court had that as its information, and now they're looking at, well, it's an existing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10993)|
| 3:03:18| What do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10998)|
| 3:03:19| But nothing bad was coming out in the assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| And later on in the case, at the very end, when they slay the dragon of, well, you know, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11002)|
| 3:03:28| Let's look at these definitions and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11008)|
| 3:03:29| They get to the end, and they say, well, there's no material evidence in the record supporting any other findings or conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11009)|
| 3:03:35| In other words, they blow off the idea that it might be hazardous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11015)|
| 3:03:38| because they didn't have anything in the record to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11018)|
| 3:03:41| The appellate court is not going to make that stuff up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11021)|
| 3:03:43| That's what they were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11023)|
| 3:03:44| They were looking at a theoretical decision, issue the permit or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11024)|
| 3:03:48| And they didn't have in front of it that these kinds of things come out, that they might affect the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11028)|
| 3:03:53| that there's smoke or odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| And you will see, if you look in our zoning regulations under Article 7, I think it is, the Section 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11035)|
| 3:04:03| says that there's specific requirements, even in industrial zones, for how much smoke, how much odor, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11043)|
| 3:04:08| and how much particulates you can release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11048)|
| 3:04:10| And that's when they're regulating smokestack industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11050)|
| 3:04:13| Ain't doing that in Office 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11053)|
| 3:04:15| So there's a lot to be said for why it shouldn't happen in a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11055)|
| 3:04:19| but there's also some tough cases out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11059)|
| 3:04:21| And I'll agree with Marshall, and I'll agree with counsel there, that if you have a fight, it'll be a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11061)|
| 3:04:26| I think Duane raises a nice question, is there a happy middle ground, or do we just see how this comes out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11066)|
| 3:04:31| But I think it's our job as a counsel to try to do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11071)|
| 3:04:35| and leave the lawyers who get paid more money than they're worth to fight the battles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11075)|
| 3:04:40| I think we've got to try to do the right thing here, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| I don't care how it comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| I think we have to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| We have to search our own conscience, look at this evidence, and try to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11090)|
| 3:04:51| Counselman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11091)|
| 3:04:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11093)|
| 3:04:54| I was just going to ask the author again if they're willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11094)|
| 3:05:00| Arthur, what I can imagine is that when you say that the air quality management group will come out every time there's a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11100)|
| 3:05:09| I can see that every time there's a hearse that rolls up there, there's going to be a complaint from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11109)|
| 3:05:14| And so, again, two questions I have, and then I'd like to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11114)|
| 3:05:19| Two questions I have is that whether or not you all would commit to different hours of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11119)|
| 3:05:27| from what it's apparently been changed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11127)|
| 3:05:30| and then whether or not you would do this testing that would really test to see what the gentleman was talking about in terms of the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11130)|
| 3:05:37| And I'm sorry I didn't see your light, so forget I said call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11137)|
| 3:05:41| But that's what I'd like to know, how you can work with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11141)|
| 3:05:47| I mean, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| The records we make will be available to their quality control board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11149)|
| 3:05:55| and we'll make them available to representatives of this organization that have filed an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11155)|
| 3:06:05| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11165)|
| 3:06:06| You've asked Mr. Seymour several questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| Just a moment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11168)|
| 3:06:09| You'll need to be called on by one of the council people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11169)|
| 3:06:15| I think it's mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11175)|
| 3:06:16| Are you still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11176)|
| 3:06:22| While they're conferring, if she'd like to come forward, I'll call on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11182)|
| 3:06:25| Mrs. Freels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11185)|
| 3:06:27| We'll limit what you're asking about limitation of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11187)|
| 3:06:35| What are they now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11195)|
| 3:06:37| I mean, they aren't going to run near as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11197)|
| 3:06:40| I think what she stated is 16 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11200)|
| 3:06:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11205)|
| 3:06:46| That's what's in the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11206)|
| 3:06:47| That's what's in the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11207)|
| 3:06:49| We'll go to 12 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11209)|
| 3:06:51| I mean, if we're lucky, we won't be running it near that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11211)|
| 3:06:57| Again, I think let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11217)|
| 3:06:59| It probably doesn't really matter in terms of what we're trying to resolve here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11219)|
| 3:07:02| because what we're looking at is whether or not the city acted correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11222)|
| 3:07:06| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11226)|
| 3:07:07| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11227)|
| 3:07:09| Rob, would you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11229)|
| 3:07:10| I mean, I'm going to ask you again to repeat what it is that we're really dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11230)|
| 3:07:16| Thank you, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11236)|
| 3:07:19| This is not a legislative decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11239)|
| 3:07:22| It's an administrative decision about whether or not the decision of the building official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11242)|
| 3:07:29| that this use was an accessory use to a funeral home was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11249)|
| 3:07:34| I've heard Councilman Dellavopia again, and once again, I appreciate his passion on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11254)|
| 3:07:41| but this is not a question of whether or not a crematorium should be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11261)|
| 3:07:47| As an accessory use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| And, Councilman Grieve, you call on Ms. Freels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11269)|
| 3:07:51| Yes, I'd like to call on the lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11271)|
| 3:07:53| Ms. Freels, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11273)|
| 3:07:56| One point I just wanted to call to the attention of the Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11276)|
| 3:07:59| when you're thinking of future consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11279)|
| 3:08:03| if this matter is not settled, well, either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11283)|
| 3:08:09| you're going to have lots of problems with maybe other funeral homes asking for the same kind of thing for a crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11289)|
| 3:08:15| And if you are going to deny them later because you're changing zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11295)|
| 3:08:22| you're going to have lawsuits anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| So my suggestion is, very humbly, that the city and the funeral home sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11304)|
| 3:08:32| and work out some sort of mediated agreement, which we'll also be glad to participate in if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11312)|
| 3:08:39| I don't think it's an automatic conclusion that you have to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11319)|
| 3:08:42| I think you could make a decision that could then be mediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11322)|
| 3:08:47| and save everybody time and trouble and make a decision for Knoxville about crematories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11327)|
| 3:08:55| Because settling this by denying our appeal is not going to settle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11335)|
| 3:09:02| Thank you very much. I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11342)|
| 3:09:04| Are you suggesting a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11344)|
| 3:09:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11346)|
| 3:09:07| I mean, is that what you're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11347)|
| 3:09:09| No. I think you should make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| I think you should rescind the permit and then sit down and see if you can settle it without a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11351)|
| 3:09:15| Or if there is a lawsuit, then try to get a mediated, formally mediated settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11355)|
| 3:09:20| I think that could be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11360)|
| 3:09:22| You've only got 30 days to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11362)|
| 3:09:23| Thank you, Mrs. Frills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| I mean, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| I'm going to call for the question, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| Okay. We have a call. That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11370)|
| 3:09:33| We're called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11373)|
| 3:09:36| Not debatable, so is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11376)|
| 3:09:38| What is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11378)|
| 3:09:39| The motion is to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| That means it would stop all of our deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11381)|
| 3:09:44| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| We beat it to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11386)|
| 3:09:47| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11387)|
| 3:09:48| Actually, there is not a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11388)|
| 3:09:50| There's no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11390)|
| 3:09:51| Oh, I thought you made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11391)|
| 3:09:52| Did you not make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11392)|
| 3:09:53| Well, do I need to restate it and say I'm making a motion to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11393)|
| 3:10:00| No, the problem is there's no motion on the floor right now, so there is no question to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11400)|
| 3:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11405)|
| 3:10:06| Nobody's made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11406)|

| 3:10:09| Let's do this, since all the lights are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| Is there a motion related to the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| I will make a motion to grant the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| which I understand would be effectively saying that it was arbitrary, capricious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11418)|
| 3:10:23| or illegal, or improperly granted as a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| We have a motion to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11426)|

| 3:11:54| and, as some of the neighbors said, the issue is going to come back again probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11514)|
| 3:11:58| that it's my hope that the funeral home will work closely with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11518)|
| 3:12:03| both in terms of testing, in terms of when you are actually going to be using the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11523)|
| 3:12:11| I think it's imperative that the two groups work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| As the lady had addressed earlier, if there's a way that you all can mediate and work this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11535)|

| 3:13:10| Yeah, one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11590)|
| 3:13:12| This says that they are no longer going to let us use the soft match of our design work to put in our whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11592)|
| 3:13:20| 20 percent share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11600)|
| 3:13:22| Is there a lot of money tied in that or we haven't even started that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| What's tied up in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| We don't traditionally use the soft match option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11607)|
| 3:13:31| It's just a change of their procedures and not really an actual problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11611)|

| 3:15:11| and apparently the builder has spoken with that family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11711)|
| 3:15:14| and they have worked out some gentleman agreement apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11714)|
| 3:15:17| so we're not trying to alter hours of operation as I was concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11717)|
| 3:15:22| and I can be directed how to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| I wanted to pass this on emergency if that's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11724)|
| 3:15:27| because I'm not trying to stop their development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11727)|
| 3:15:30| and therefore we would have to wait another two weeks until we would pass this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11730)|
| 3:15:36| I want to go ahead and move that forward for the business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11736)|
| 3:15:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11740)|
| 3:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11743)|
| 3:15:44| I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11744)|
| 3:15:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11745)|
| 3:15:46| Someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11746)|
| 3:15:47| He's asking him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11747)|
| 3:15:48| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11748)|
| 3:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11749)|
| 3:15:50| First we pass that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11750)|
| 3:15:51| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11751)|
| 3:15:52| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11752)|
| 3:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11753)|
| 3:15:54| Make a motion now to approve it on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11757)|
| 3:15:58| I make a motion to pass it on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11758)|
| 3:15:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11759)|
| 3:16:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11760)|
| 3:16:01| All in favor of the amendment, which is to pass it on emergency, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11761)|
| 3:16:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11768)|
| 3:16:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11769)|
| 3:16:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11770)|
| 3:16:11| And now we have to vote on the motion or on the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11771)|
| 3:16:16| And we already had a motion and a second, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11776)|
| 3:16:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11778)|
| 3:16:19| Quick question to Mr. Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11779)|
| 3:16:21| Are they going to specify like 9 to 9 or 9 to 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11781)|
| 3:16:25| They're just going to do that privately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11785)|
| 3:16:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11786)|
| 3:16:27| They're approving it as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11787)|
| 3:16:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11788)|
| 3:16:29| We can't request that per state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| There's another laundromat right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| And that would limit competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11797)|
| 3:16:38| The parties are comfortable with this the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11798)|
| 3:16:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11800)|
| 3:16:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11801)|
| 3:16:42| The motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11802)|

| 3:16:52| from the Community Improvement Fund and donating same to Holston Middle School to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11812)|

| 3:17:05| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11825)|
| 3:17:06| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11826)|
| 3:17:07| No one has signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11827)|
| 3:17:09| And so there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120221?start=11829)|
