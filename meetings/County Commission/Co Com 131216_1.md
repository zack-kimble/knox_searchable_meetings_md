| 2:50:36| We've got enough organized bodies that we're adversarial with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| We don't want to bring an NPC to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| And my only question to you, Mr. Donaldson, is about Mr. Kline brought up this property that's counted for acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10243)|
| 2:50:55| does it count, transfer of property rights, all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10255)|
| 2:50:59| Could you comment on that, whether that's, you know, copasetic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10259)|
| 2:51:04| Is that something that's done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| Is that contiguous property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10266)|
| 2:51:08| How does that work into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10268)|
| 2:51:10| Yes, thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10270)|
| 2:51:13| This particular tract of land is shown on KGIS as one single parcel divided into three separate polygons by roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10273)|
| 2:51:24| but it has a single parcel number 114018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10284)|
| 2:51:31| You click on any part of that tract and the entire set of three polygons pops up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10291)|
| 2:51:38| So it's under common ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| It's a single parcel, and we are creating a single zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10300)|
| 2:51:44| Now, our history for three decades has been to allow people to cluster density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10304)|
| 2:51:50| within a single planned residential zone district to move it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10310)|
| 2:51:55| We feel to achieve the most appropriate place for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10315)|
| 2:52:01| and save the most sensitive areas for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10321)|
| 2:52:04| So if indeed we want to save and not disturb the part of the parcel that is west of Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10324)|
| 2:52:14| we would want to transfer or cluster that development right over to a more suitable part of that single zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10334)|
| 2:52:25| But it is technically not a transfer of development rights program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10345)|
| 2:52:29| We do not have that in place yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10349)|
| 2:52:30| We have the authority to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10350)|
| 2:52:33| But Knox County Commission has not adopted a transfer of development rights program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10353)|
| 2:52:37| which would allow one property owner to transfer rights to another property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10357)|
| 2:52:43| in a completely different part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10363)|
| 2:52:47| It entails identifying sending areas and identifying receiving areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10367)|
| 2:52:54| and coming up with the protocol to manage that transfer of rights, literally becoming land bankers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10374)|
| 2:53:02| But we very commonly allow for the shifting of density within a planned residential zone district to preserve sensitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10382)|
| 2:53:12| areas and to develop where it makes the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10392)|
| 2:53:16| Now, with regard to the 17-plus acres on the west side of Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10396)|
| 2:53:21| to define that as undevelopable I think is wrong, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10401)|
| 2:53:25| It has frontage on a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10405)|
| 2:53:29| Therefore, it has access to that public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10409)|
| 2:53:34| There are any number of ways where access to the entire part of that property can be achieved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10414)|
| 2:53:42| including easements through the interstate below the bridge or below the roadway, a bridge across the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10422)|
| 2:53:52| the purchase of property elsewhere to make a link to a public road elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10432)|
| 2:53:57| So there are any number of ways to make that property developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10437)|
| 2:54:02| But, frankly, we don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10442)|
| 2:54:03| We want to encourage its preservation in an undisturbed character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10443)|
| 2:54:08| so we would allow them to shift the development right elsewhere on that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10448)|
| 2:54:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10454)|
| 2:54:15| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10455)|
| 2:54:19| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| One, I wanted to thank both the community for all the people I've spoken to there and visited with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10461)|
| 2:54:26| and also with the developer who I also had the opportunity to visit with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10466)|
| 2:54:31| And thank you for spending time with me and answering my questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10471)|
| 2:54:34| and taking me around and showing me what you had planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10474)|
| 2:54:38| I think that you've got a --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10478)|
| 2:54:44| I don't have a problem with apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| I think you've got a good concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10486)|
| 2:54:48| I think that you have worked with the community well, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10488)|
| 2:54:56| I do have a problem with the marina, as long as that's part of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10496)|
| 2:55:04| I can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| I have a problem with density, and I think that I don't want to say that you've been misled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10506)|
| 2:55:15| or I'm not sure exactly the word that I want to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| but I think that the use of giving you density bonuses for something like public access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10520)|
| 2:55:27| when there really is no access I think is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10527)|
| 2:55:32| And I think that going by plan ET, I think plan ET is great, and it's been a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10532)|
| 2:55:41| It isn't something that we, as a commission, have agreed to use in our planning process yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10541)|
| 2:55:48| and we need to use the process that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| And I don't think that 14 to 1 does tell the whole story on that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10550)|
| 2:56:02| And that may have been the final vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| but we as a body in the past have definitely sent things back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10564)|
| 2:56:09| and we've definitely voted things down that they have approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10569)|
| 2:56:13| So just because MPC votes yes doesn't necessarily mean that I'm going to vote yes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10573)|
| 2:56:19| So I don't think any of us do that up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10579)|
| 2:56:25| I don't think we take any of the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| We are sometimes challenged by process, but I think we do like to make our own decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10587)|
| 2:56:36| I would like to know more about one thing that I haven't heard enough about is plans for stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10596)|
| 2:56:43| mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| That's something that I haven't heard mentioned much at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10605)|
| 2:56:50| And also, another concern I have is the fragility of the ecosystem in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10610)|
| 2:56:57| and you and I did have a conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| I can't say that I was thrilled with the response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| but that's another reason why I feel like this is not something I can support as it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10623)|
| 2:57:10| I think that if the marina were gone and the density were down a little bit, this is something I could support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10630)|
| 2:57:17| and I applaud you on your concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| But as it stands with this density and with the marina as part of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10639)|
| 2:57:25| it's not something currently that I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10645)|
| 2:57:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| I'd like to ask Nathan Silvis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10650)|
| 2:57:31| He's the consulting SEC, the consulting engineer who's handling all of the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10651)|
| 2:57:38| Nathan Silvis, 1815 Nantasket Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10658)|
| 2:57:43| Just a general conversation about stormwater, or was there a specific question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10663)|
| 2:57:46| No, I want specifics about how you're going to handle stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10666)|
| 2:57:50| Well, the Knox County Stormwater Ordinance requires attention on properties where there's a downstream damage reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10670)|
| 2:57:58| On this property, there's not because we're adjacent to the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10678)|
| 2:58:01| So we won't have detention ponds, but we still have to treat the 80 percent total suspended solids removal requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10681)|
| 2:58:07| So we will have treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| How?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10689)|
| 2:58:10| Proprietary devices that are --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10690)|
| 2:58:14| It's equipment that's at the end of the stormwater pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| They're approved by Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| They vortex the water and filter it, and then those are cleaned out periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10699)|
| 2:58:28| They meet the 80 percent requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10708)|
| 2:58:41| I guess you know a little bit about the environmental side, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| I mean, that's the interesting thing, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| I mean, if you look at this development versus, you know, what could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10726)|
| 2:58:51| You know, I mean, and we're very concerned about the environmental impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| But that's one of the biggest reasons why we're trying to conserve 25 acres around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10734)|
| 2:58:58| I mean, if this property did end up in some sort of single-family development, it's most likely it would be clear-cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10738)|
| 2:59:07| I mean, that's just the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10747)|
| 2:59:08| That's the normal way it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| And that's where with the hillside and ridgetop stuff, with this body and the adoption of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| they've sent a clear message to me that they want to try to get away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10754)|
| 2:59:20| You know, let's try to conserve, you know, the areas around the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| And, yes, yes, we do have more density down there, but it's a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| I mean, there's the occupancy rates for apartments right now in West Knoxville are between 97 and 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10768)|
| 2:59:37| As Mr. McKenzie had mentioned, things are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10777)|
| 2:59:40| You know, you've got Generation X, Generation Y, you know, these guys coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10780)|
| 2:59:44| And the reality is not all of them want to live in a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| You know, even the older people are wanting to be in a true maintenance-free situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10787)|
| 2:59:53| I mean, even if you're in a condominium, everybody says condominiums are so maintenance-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10793)|
| 2:59:57| Well, when the dishwasher breaks and it floods your floor and it starts popping all your hardwood up, who do you call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10797)|
| 3:00:03| Who's responsible for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10805)|
| 3:00:06| You know, I mean, if it happens in a nice apartment complex, you call the maintenance man and he takes care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| So we really are trying to make an effort to meet the market and the future demand of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10811)|
| 3:00:17| as well as conserve, you know, as much of the property for the ecosystem around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10817)|
| 3:00:23| I agree, but I don't think everybody moving in needs to move into your apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10823)|
| 3:00:27| I think that there are other apartments that can be built as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10827)|
| 3:00:30| I don't think you have to build them all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10830)|
| 3:00:32| I also think, you know, as far as looking ahead as to what might happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10832)|
| 3:00:36| this is the same conversation I'm hearing about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10836)|
| 3:00:39| Well, these kids, they're probably going to go to private school, or they're probably going to be homeschooled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10839)|
| 3:00:43| or these apartment dwellers, they aren't going to own boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| Or, yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| We don't know what might happen if this gets voted up or gets voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10847)|
| 3:00:51| So I don't like being scared into, well, if this doesn't happen, somebody's going to come in and clear-cut this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10851)|
| 3:00:59| I don't appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10859)|
| 3:01:00| I'm not trying to scare everybody with it, but what we do have is a plan before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10860)|
| 3:01:05| Right, and as I said, I thought that your concept was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10865)|
| 3:01:09| The problem I have is the marina and the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10869)|
| 3:01:13| And, you know, we talked about the half the year it's a peninsula, the other half of the year it's an island,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10873)|
| 3:01:20| because part of it is underwater half of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10880)|
| 3:01:24| And there is a large family of great blue herons that nest there every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10884)|
| 3:01:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10889)|
| 3:01:30| And you want to build a footpath out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10890)|
| 3:01:31| Even though I mentioned half the year it's going to be underwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10891)|
| 3:01:34| And your answer was kind of, eh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| You know, it just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| I think the reality is, you know, with all due respect, I mean, the reality is if any development happens there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10898)|
| 3:01:45| we don't know the migratory bird, you know, where it's going to go, what it's going to do, if there's a footpath or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10905)|
| 3:01:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10911)|
| 3:01:52| And that's another reason why I'm not in favor of something that's quite so dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10912)|
| 3:01:56| I don't think that it's a safe thing to do environmentally around this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10916)|
| 3:02:02| And certainly the marina is not something that I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10922)|
| 3:02:07| And I know that it's not even been approved yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| And that's another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10929)|
| 3:02:10| If it's not approved by TVA, what's going to happen to that piece of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10930)|
| 3:02:15| The community has a right to know what would happen there if that marina, if you don't get approval for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10935)|
| 3:02:21| Well, right now it's just zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10941)|
| 3:02:23| I mean, the marina is an approved use, an allowable use under agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10943)|
| 3:02:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10947)|
| 3:02:28| So if it doesn't get approved, it will be agricultural unless we bring something else back to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10948)|
| 3:02:33| Mr. Donaldson and this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| But there's a number of things that are allowed under agricultural use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10955)|
| 3:02:39| There could be a chicken farm or a, you know, I mean, there's a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| I mean, you could build houses on it, single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10962)|
| 3:02:45| Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things you can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| But this is the application that we have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| And specifically about TVA, we met with them three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| And they made it clear to us that they wanted us to have our local approvals before we approach them for their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10973)|
| 3:03:02| You know, there's still so many steps that have to go to, as you said, to even know if it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10982)|
| 3:03:08| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10988)|
| 3:03:09| You know, but we know, you know, we think it's an appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10989)|
| 3:03:12| Yeah, there's two other marinas there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10992)|
| 3:03:14| You know, they're obviously working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10994)|
| 3:03:18| Well, and this is not on a big portion of the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=10998)|
| 3:03:20| This is in a small little cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| Every drop of oil or gas that gets spilled there is going to back up into that cove and kill the stuff that's back in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11003)|
| 3:03:30| I just, as long as the marina is part of the plan, it's not something that I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11010)|
| 3:03:35| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11015)|
| 3:03:36| Same thing goes with the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| Unfortunately, I think that the bonus for, like I said, public access, I think, is quite a stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11018)|
| 3:03:47| considering where the public would be required to park and then have to go under the interstate to get over to the public access part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11027)|
| 3:03:55| I think that was inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| I think it was a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11037)|
| 3:04:00| On Mr. Donaldson's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| Well, I think, I mean, and I've spoken a lot with Doug Battelle about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11043)|
| 3:04:06| I mean, we, and I believe Mr. Whitaker even brought up that we're trying to put a gas station there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11046)|
| 3:04:12| in this one little spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11052)|
| 3:04:13| But really what we had it earmarked for was a parking lot for Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11053)|
| 3:04:18| You know, so they pull in there and they park and they get on to get their mountain bikes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11058)|
| 3:04:22| or they start jogging and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11062)|
| 3:04:24| That's really what we had always envisioned, you know, happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11064)|
| 3:04:27| I mean, that's what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11067)|
| 3:04:29| You know, is to jog and to exercise, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| But there's no access from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11072)|
| 3:04:35| There would be access if we gave them a parking lot of Emery Church Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11075)|
| 3:04:39| And you would build that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11079)|
| 3:04:40| I didn't say I'd build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11080)|
| 3:04:41| I was going to give the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| Well, I mean, I'm donating land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| I'm giving easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11086)|
| 3:04:47| You know, we're putting $400,000 into the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11087)|
| 3:04:52| I'm giving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| Like I said, I do appreciate the time that you've spent with all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| And I appreciate especially the time that you've spent with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11097)|
| 3:04:59| But, as I said, as long as the marina is part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11099)|
| 3:05:03| And I would, if the density were less and the marina were not part of it, I would be happy to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11103)|
| 3:05:10| But the way it is, I just cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11112)|
| 3:05:13| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11113)|
| 3:05:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| I would like, first of all, to say a couple of things in reference to the hillside plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11119)|
| 3:05:25| that, for instance, I spent with the staff and Ms. Pionke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11125)|
| 3:05:32| and several other people in this room for three years on it, on the hillside plan, ridgetop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11132)|
| 3:05:40| I really think that John has done a good job of designing this with that plan in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11140)|
| 3:05:48| and the principles that we tried to say needed to be understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11148)|
| 3:05:57| and serve as a set of guidelines for development in Knox County for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11157)|
| 3:06:03| I think that John's doing a good job at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11163)|
| 3:06:08| And because of that, fundamentally, I'm in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11168)|
| 3:06:13| and I'm going to vote in favor of John's development and would urge my colleagues to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11173)|
| 3:06:21| But that doesn't mean that I don't have a few problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11181)|
| 3:06:26| I do have problems with the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11186)|
| 3:06:30| And I think what I'm going to rely on in terms of being able to vote favorably for the rezoning is that this has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11190)|
| 3:06:39| I'm going to encourage the BZA to get after the marina question, and hopefully the TVA will too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11199)|
| 3:06:48| and just allow that set of processes to cover that aspect of whatever I think is faulty about the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11208)|
| 3:06:56| And I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11216)|
| 3:06:59| I think that this is just a real good example of the professionals that we have to rely on to help us make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11219)|
| 3:07:09| doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| And so when you have the staff, when you have the MPC staff working with John all the way through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11231)|
| 3:07:20| apparently, and being in favor, and you have engineering working with him and being in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11240)|
| 3:07:27| and then the commissioners, of course, on their vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11247)|
| 3:07:30| it's a really tall stack of support that I don't see how I think it would be very difficult to go against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11250)|
| 3:07:39| There was Ms. Whitaker did have a statement, a couple of statements that I would like to question you about, I guess, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11259)|
| 3:07:50| And that is on the environmental side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11270)|
| 3:07:53| In the development process, knowing the geology, you know, some of the issues here with the geology of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11273)|
| 3:08:04| I hadn't considered that quite so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11284)|
| 3:08:07| And we'd just like you to address that from, you know, from that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11287)|
| 3:08:14| Is there --where is the concern in terms of how to build these buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11294)|
| 3:08:20| and set footers and all those types of things that you're going to have to do in relation to the hydrogeology of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11300)|
| 3:08:28| the cave system, Holston formation, all that stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11308)|
| 3:08:33| Yeah, I'll do my best with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11313)|
| 3:08:35| I do have one question for David Milgaard, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11315)|
| 3:08:37| I mean, we've talked about, I believe the cave system stops before it gets over there, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11317)|
| 3:08:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11327)|
| 3:08:48| There's no evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11328)|
| 3:08:50| Yeah, there's no evidence at the actual caves and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11330)|
| 3:08:52| I mean, we know where Sinking Creek is, you know, the embayment where it actually comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11332)|
| 3:08:57| Now, we've been very careful to try to preserve, you know, 10 to 12 acres right in that area to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11337)|
| 3:09:04| there's no damage to the salamanders and that type of ecosystem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| But one of the things we're trying to do is instead of blasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| and going down into the property is to bring some dirt over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11352)|
| 3:09:17| It's been greatly exaggerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11357)|
| 3:09:18| We do not have 20 feet of fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11358)|
| 3:09:20| Where they're talking about, we have an average of about 10 feet of fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11360)|
| 3:09:24| But we're coming in in an effort to bridge over top of that so we don't have to get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11364)|
| 3:09:30| Nathan, again, is the professional on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11370)|
| 3:09:33| If I can allow him to speak, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11373)|
| 3:09:36| I think the concern was mentioned earlier about the Ten Mile Creek watershed draining down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11376)|
| 3:09:42| disappearing into a sinkhole and popping out here and forming Sinking Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11382)|
| 3:09:47| We're at the downstream end of all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11387)|
| 3:09:49| And all of our work is above the channel that that's discharging into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11389)|
| 3:09:54| In order to plug that sinkhole, you'd have to be on the upstream side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11394)|
| 3:09:57| You'd have to be up on Ebenezer Road somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11397)|
| 3:09:58| I think it was a mattress that washed down in there and caused the flooding several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11398)|
| 3:10:04| Any blasting that we do on our property is not going to be we've attempted to minimize it by bringing the dirt over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11404)|
| 3:10:12| There's a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11412)|
| 3:10:13| It's better to bridge over rock instead of trying to remove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11413)|
| 3:10:19| But all that said, we're still over 1,000 feet away from the mouth of the cave with any of our construction activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11419)|
| 3:10:25| And that's plenty of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11425)|
| 3:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11427)|
| 3:10:28| So you don't, Nathan, you don't feel like in terms of drainage processes or water movement after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11428)|
| 3:10:37| after this is built, you don't see issues with this development process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11437)|
| 3:10:44| No, it would be difficult for us to have an impact on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11444)|
| 3:10:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| Real quick before we move to Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11449)|
| 3:10:53| Mr. Sanders from the Law Director's Office would like to speak to the marina issue and the zoning and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11453)|
| 3:11:00| I discussed the matter with Commissioner Norman earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11460)|
| 3:11:03| and I'd like the Board to understand that there are two separate issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11463)|
| 3:11:08| This rezoning is not tied to the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11468)|
| 3:11:12| One way or another, the marina is a stand-alone matter that will be before the Board of Zoning Appeals in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11472)|
| 3:11:18| This could be approved and the marina could be not denied or this could be denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11478)|
| 3:11:23| and the marina could be approved as two stand-alone items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11483)|
| 3:11:27| And I would just want the Board to understand that and not make a decision on the understanding that they're somehow tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11487)|
| 3:11:37| Commissioner Norman, do you have any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| Your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11499)|
| 3:11:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11500)|
| 3:11:41| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11501)|
| 3:11:42| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11502)|
| 3:11:43| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11503)|
| 3:11:44| This is the third or fourth time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11504)|
| 3:11:45| I want to reply to what Commissioner McKenzie asked a while ago about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11505)|
| 3:11:50| we adopt a plan and we complain because we're using the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11510)|
| 3:11:54| You know, the equation is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11514)|
| 3:11:57| It's the figures you put into that equation that muddy the waters in this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11517)|
| 3:12:02| and causes the problems that Commissioner Burroughs just brought up on the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11522)|
| 3:12:07| As I showed you earlier in that three-part property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| if you've got five units to the acre on this piece, it's all on one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11531)|
| 3:12:17| But even if you try to build on this 15% slope, you can't put more than two to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11537)|
| 3:12:23| So you can't transfer five off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| And if you go above the 25% and some of this is 40, you can't put, again, but a half unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11545)|
| 3:12:32| which means you can't take the rest of those and you can only transfer a half acre down here to this part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11552)|
| 3:12:39| and two acres from this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11559)|
| 3:12:40| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11560)|
| 3:12:42| We're adding modern math, two plus two and getting six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11562)|
| 3:12:47| When two plus two, I don't care if it's day one or today, it's still four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11567)|
| 3:12:52| Now, this is some of the things that we need to have solidified through this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11572)|
| 3:13:00| so that the MPC can have some more direct levels to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11580)|
| 3:13:07| and more directives because this is a confusing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11587)|
| 3:13:14| We need to develop a plan to show what the differences are when you have this type of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11594)|
| 3:13:25| These are things that need to be put down for their guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11605)|
| 3:13:29| They need to be brought to us to be codified, and then they can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11609)|
| 3:13:34| I don't have a problem with using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11614)|
| 3:13:35| I don't have any problem with apartments on this particular site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11615)|
| 3:13:40| but I have a definite problem in using these figures in that equation as a five units to the whole smear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11620)|
| 3:13:51| to get that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11631)|
| 3:13:53| And I'm not sure that if you really took what it says under our Knox County general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11633)|
| 3:14:02| unusable acreage, excluding areas which are underwater in floodways, have steep slopes, or otherwise undevelopable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11642)|
| 3:14:09| There was a couple more in one of them, and I don't see it right there at this particular moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11649)|
| 3:14:14| But that covers a lot of territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11654)|
| 3:14:16| Did the MPC look at the GPS and say, okay, they can tell you what is underwater or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11656)|
| 3:14:22| They can tell you what slope it is by their GPS things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11662)|
| 3:14:26| Was those things figured down to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| or did we just take a couple of shots on this whole hundred-acre spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11668)|
| 3:14:33| and that's how we developed that a certain percentage of this and a certain percentage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11673)|
| 3:14:38| I want to see acre by acre what each one of those slopes are so we can really put it in the right category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11678)|
| 3:14:45| If need be, we can send it back to MPC and have them re-lick their calf over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11685)|
| 3:14:54| What I'm going to do is give each side five minutes in rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11694)|
| 3:14:59| And we're going to, if there's no other commissioner questions or any other, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11699)|
| 3:15:04| So I guess on a normal basis, the applicant goes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11704)|
| 3:15:10| But it's up to you, Mr. Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11710)|
| 3:15:11| Huber, if you want to go first or second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| I'll defer again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11713)|
| 3:15:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11714)|
| 3:15:15| It's 736.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11715)|
| 3:15:16| Mr. Kline, you have five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11716)|
| 3:15:19| I just wanted to address what Commissioner McKenzie, Commissioner Broyles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11719)|
| 3:15:24| Commissioner Brown were talking about when you talk about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11724)|
| 3:15:28| If you take a look at the MPC rezoning report, the last page has the calculations of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11728)|
| 3:15:36| And the density calculated by MPC using the 17.6 acres, which we have already talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11736)|
| 3:15:44| I'm not going to talk about those 17.6 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11744)|
| 3:15:47| But let's just talk about what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| Using their calculations, they got 206 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11749)|
| 3:15:55| That's what they got under those calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| How do we get 324 from 206, folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| I'll tell you how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11760)|
| 3:16:01| This is how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| You take a look at the second page of the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11763)|
| 3:16:05| It says, we're going to recommend five, up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11765)|
| 3:16:10| After they've already done this calculation, which Commissioner Brown has appropriately noted was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11770)|
| 3:16:15| appropriately done, should have been done, only to the calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| Then they said, well, we're going to jack it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11778)|
| 3:16:22| Staff is recommending the additional density on the site, allowing for up to five dwelling units per every acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11782)|
| 3:16:30| based on the following locational criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| One, the site is located within a half mile from the major interchange of Pellissippi Parkway and Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11793)|
| 3:16:40| Where's the red that says, when you're located like that, you get a density bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11800)|
| 3:16:44| There is none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11804)|
| 3:16:46| Two, the site is adjacent to and has easy access to Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11806)|
| 3:16:50| which is a major regional transportation corridor linking Anderson, Knox and Blount Counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11810)|
| 3:16:56| Smacks of Plan E.T. and that's not a reason to give density bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11816)|
| 3:17:01| Three, the site is surrounded by suburban low-density residential development at zoning densities of up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11821)|
| 3:17:09| That's not a reason for a bonus density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11829)|
| 3:17:12| Four, the site is separated from lower-density development by a railroad right-of-way to the north and portions of Fort Loudon Lake to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11832)|
| 3:17:19| east and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11839)|
| 3:17:20| To the south are two large parcels that are zoned planned residential at densities ranging from three to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11840)|
| 3:17:28| And five, the site is located in such a way that it has lake frontage, as well as higher elevation areas that could offer mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11848)|
| 3:17:35| views, increasing the desire for greater density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11855)|
| 3:17:40| Are you kidding me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11860)|
| 3:17:42| You don't go from 206 units to 324 based upon those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11862)|
| 3:17:49| That's not a reason for density bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11869)|
| 3:17:51| You should turn around and say, we deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11871)|
| 3:17:55| That's the reason, Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11875)|
| 3:17:57| Commissioner McKenzie, I'm sorry I didn't have time to talk with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11877)|
| 3:18:00| I would have explained this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11880)|
| 3:18:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11882)|
| 3:18:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11890)|
| 3:18:24| All right, it's 7.39, Mr. Hueber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11904)|
| 3:18:25| You've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11905)|
| 3:18:26| I'll certainly make it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11906)|
| 3:18:29| I guess the biggest thing I just want to implore is to reiterate with you guys that this is low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11909)|
| 3:18:36| What we are proposing is low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11916)|
| 3:18:39| As I said in the sector plan, in places, low-density land, zone five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11919)|
| 3:18:44| has been developed with apartment uses, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11924)|
| 3:18:48| And the reason it stays low-density is because we're just taking the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11928)|
| 3:18:51| and pushing it on to the better part of the land and conserving everything else around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11931)|
| 3:18:55| We certainly agree with staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11935)|
| 3:18:58| and appreciate a 14-to-1 vote from the independent planning commissioners last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11938)|
| 3:19:06| So we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11946)|
| 3:19:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11949)|
| 3:19:10| I just wanted to know if Mark Donaldson wanted to speak to any of those density bonuses that were granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11950)|
| 3:19:18| since it's not part of any of our policy or anything like that, why he felt that that was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11958)|
| 3:19:25| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11965)|
| 3:19:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11966)|
| 3:19:27| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| Parties from both sides have been rather loose with the terms, rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11969)|
| 3:19:34| and regulations with regard to the Hillside Enriched Top Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11974)|
| 3:19:37| We do not have any rules or regulations with regard to hillside enriched top development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11977)|
| 3:19:46| I'll read from the paragraph that Knox County adopted into the Hillside Enriched Top Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11986)|
| 3:19:51| the first and the last sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11991)|
| 3:19:55| This plan and the principles, objectives, policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11995)|
| 3:19:58| and guidelines included herein are advisory in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=11998)|
| 3:20:01| and constitute non-binding recommendations for consideration in connection with development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12001)|
| 3:20:07| in those deeply sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12007)|
| 3:20:10| And it goes on to say that they will serve as a guide to future MPC staff recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12010)|
| 3:20:17| but is not intended to form an official part of the general plan that would be binding on future land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12017)|
| 3:20:22| decisions by county commission, MPC, or BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12022)|
| 3:20:26| And it concludes, any comparable provisions of the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12026)|
| 3:20:34| or any sector plan which relate to hillside enriched top protection shall also be considered advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12034)|
| 3:20:40| consistent with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12040)|
| 3:20:42| This is the paragraph that you inserted when Knox County Commission adopted the Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12042)|
| 3:20:47| Enriched Top Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12047)|
| 3:20:49| It is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12049)|
| 3:20:51| We do not have codified rules or regulations with regard to hillside enriched top development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12051)|
| 3:21:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12063)|
| 3:21:04| Go ahead, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12064)|
| 3:21:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12065)|
| 3:21:06| So with respect to the staff's rationale for making a recommendation of five units to the acre on this particular piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12066)|
| 3:21:12| of land, it is location, location, location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12072)|
| 3:21:20| It is in close proximity to the major arterial that delivers our Knox County citizens to more than 14,000 jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12080)|
| 3:21:29| at DOE in Anderson County and the largest cluster of manufacturing jobs in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12089)|
| 3:21:37| It is the main thoroughfare through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12097)|
| 3:21:41| And it provides access to all parts of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12101)|
| 3:21:46| And, frankly, it is consistent with the zoning that is in that same proximity to that same interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12106)|
| 3:21:55| Immediately diagonally through that interchange is a large tract of land zoned at PR up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12115)|
| 3:22:06| There are apartments in that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12126)|
| 3:22:09| It is immediately adjacent to land that is zoned at up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12129)|
| 3:22:17| There are provisions in the general plan as far as guiding you with regard to extensions of zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12137)|
| 3:22:25| and land use classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12145)|
| 3:22:28| So there are any number of reasons to go up to five units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12148)|
| 3:22:34| which is consistent with the sector plan and the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12154)|
| 3:22:41| They aren't asking for an amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12161)|
| 3:22:47| So we don't, we quite literally don't have to bring that into the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12167)|
| 3:22:51| Is this zoning request appropriate in that location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12171)|
| 3:22:56| On balance, staff recommended that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12176)|
| 3:23:00| The planning commission agreed with us by a 14-to-1 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12180)|
| 3:23:03| But, ultimately, it is a legislative decision up to this board to set the zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12183)|
| 3:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12194)|
| 3:23:15| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12195)|
| 3:23:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12196)|
| 3:23:17| And to kind of piggyback on that, to answer your question, Mr. Klein, or your challenge, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12197)|
| 3:23:24| you and I didn't have to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12204)|
| 3:23:26| So those four reasons, again, you make those four reasons for, you call them density bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12206)|
| 3:23:35| There's no rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12215)|
| 3:23:36| There's no law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| There should have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12217)|
| 3:23:38| But there's no rule, no law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12218)|
| 3:23:39| We did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12219)|
| 3:23:40| So you were correct in what he chose to elevate the number by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12220)|
| 3:23:47| But you didn't finish the other side of it and say, well, what's a good density bonus, to use your term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12227)|
| 3:23:55| There are none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12235)|
| 3:23:56| Because there are no policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12236)|
| 3:23:57| There's no law to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12237)|
| 3:23:58| So you have to accept the professionals and question the professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12238)|
| 3:24:03| and challenge the professionals, which is what I think NBC did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| So, you know, when you say these are four no-good reasons, that's an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12247)|
| 3:24:13| If I come up with four and you agree with, that's another opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12253)|
| 3:24:17| I mean, so, you know, and again, I'm not arguing whether 300 is too many, 200 is too few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12257)|
| 3:24:25| I'm just looking at the question that we were given, the challenge that we were assigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12265)|
| 3:24:32| and we have to go by something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12272)|
| 3:24:35| We got one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12275)|
| 3:24:36| Well, you can't divide it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12276)|
| 3:24:38| That was the whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12278)|
| 3:24:39| We wanted not to build on steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12279)|
| 3:24:42| That's where we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12282)|
| 3:24:44| That was where this thing started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12284)|
| 3:24:46| So how do we not build on steep slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12286)|
| 3:24:48| You got one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12288)|
| 3:24:50| How do you not build on steep slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12290)|
| 3:24:53| Build on good parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12293)|
| 3:24:54| So, you know, again, this is emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12294)|
| 3:24:58| It's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12298)|
| 3:24:59| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12299)|
| 3:25:00| But in terms of what's before us, I agree with Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12300)|
| 3:25:04| I think it's been laid out fairly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12304)|
| 3:25:06| I think this is one of the few projects that I've seen since we've passed that ordinance with the Briggs Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12306)|
| 3:25:17| that actually tried to listen to it, which still I think was the body's preference to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12317)|
| 3:25:24| but the meat of it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12324)|
| 3:25:25| So, you know, I think this project has gone through the processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12325)|
| 3:25:31| So that's why I'm going to vote in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12331)|
| 3:25:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12334)|
| 3:25:35| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12335)|
| 3:25:36| Dwight Vandervaet, you wanted to speak very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12336)|
| 3:25:42| That's the last thing before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12342)|
| 3:25:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12344)|
| 3:25:45| And very briefly, Dwight Vandervaet, Knox County Engineering and Public Works, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12345)|
| 3:25:49| Commissioner Norman, I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12349)|
| 3:25:52| It is not our place to support or to oppose any project of this nature, and we do not support nor do we oppose this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12352)|
| 3:25:59| We're asked to provide guidance as to the implications that the development may have for public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12359)|
| 3:26:04| and that is what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12364)|
| 3:26:06| And in this case, the developer has provided a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12366)|
| 3:26:10| Cindy has reviewed that traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12370)|
| 3:26:13| We've made clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12373)|
| 3:26:15| We have conditions that are attached, in particular Conditions 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the NPC staff report that is associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12375)|
| 3:26:22| with what's before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12382)|
| 3:26:24| And we are comfortable with those conditions and the financial obligations that both the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12384)|
| 3:26:29| and Knox County would incur should this project go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12389)|
| 3:26:33| But we don't offer an opinion and should not offer an opinion in support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12393)|
| 3:26:38| or in opposition to this or any other project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12398)|
| 3:26:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12402)|
| 3:26:43| Before we vote, we're going to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| I want to say to the commissioners and to the audience, we've had two and a half, two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12405)|
| 3:26:50| a little over two and a half hours of good debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| And I appreciate the way that, and I hope both sides feel like they had equal time and opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12412)|
| 3:26:57| But I do appreciate the time that everybody has spent and the way the debate was handled tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12417)|
| 3:27:02| So, Madam Clerk, we're going to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12422)|
| 3:27:04| The motion is to approve based on NPC recommendations starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12424)|
| 3:27:09| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12429)|

| 3:27:31| and the e-mails you sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| I did try to answer everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12453)|
| 3:27:35| I may not have got all of them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12455)|
| 3:27:37| But I'm your representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12457)|
| 3:27:38| I'm your voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12458)|

| 3:28:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12494)|
| 3:28:15| I would like to make a motion that we direct the MPC to come back to us with a list of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12495)|
| 3:28:22| with suggested limits that can be approved so we don't have to get through this dog-and-pony show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12502)|
| 3:28:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12510)|
| 3:28:31| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12511)|
| 3:28:32| Well, we can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12512)|
| 3:28:33| It's not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12513)|
| 3:28:34| But if you'll send an e-mail to me, I'll forward it to the MPC to have them study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom131216?start=12514)|
