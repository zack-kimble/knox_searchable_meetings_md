| 0:02:29| The ayes have it, and the consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| For the Mayor's report, first I want to say that our Christmas in the City celebrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| are continuing and have been a big success so far, a lot of people coming out for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| You know, we know this is a very special time of year, but not just for Christians who celebrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| I've read that between November and mid-January that there are about 29 holidays observed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| by seven of the world's major religions, which is pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| So we recognize that we are a very diverse city with many different faiths that each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| have their own celebrations and holy days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| So as we celebrate Christmas in the City, we also wish everyone a very happy and holy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| holidays for whatever celebration you might be involved with, and we hope that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| a very special time for families and for friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| 2016 has been a very busy year for all of us, and it's been a pleasure to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| City Council and with our City staff and all the many volunteers, the people who serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| on our boards and agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| We have many partners, and I think it's been a really good year for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| We're actually pulling together, we do this every year, pull together a summary of accomplishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| by each department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| So we'll be getting that out once that's all pulled together after the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| It's kind of amazing when you look back to see what all we actually did to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| and what we've accomplished and what we're in the midst of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| But we'll also be celebrating New Year's Eve downtown once again on Market Square with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| the countdown and a ball drop at midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| There will be music at the Bill Lyons Pavilion on Market Square, and the holidays on Ice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| Rink will stay open late, so you can actually skate right into 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| You might want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| A few notes on City operations during the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| With both Christmas and New Year's Day falling on Sunday this year, we are observing those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| holidays on the following Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| So the city offices will be closed on Monday, December 26, and on Monday, January 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| Our trash and recycling collection, however, will not be affected, so everyone can put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| out their carts as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| So if you're like us with the Monday collection, you still put them out on Monday, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| the city offices are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| So speaking of trash collection, I just want to remind everyone of a few changes coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| at the start of the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| Most households in the city should have already received their new city-issued garbage carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| By the way, Mayor Burchett tweeted this afternoon that he got his, and he's very psyched, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| He likes them a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| So he said that was a nice Christmas present from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Actually he said from the mayor, but it was from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| So you see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| You can tell him we're glad he likes his present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| But if you haven't gotten your cart yet, you'll be getting it either this week or next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| because those carts and only those carts will be used for garbage starting the first week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| So remember, new year, new carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| I've seen some people have already been putting them out there, but we hope you will wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| and use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Our system starts after January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| So this is all part of the new solid waste contract that council recently approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| There's also a change in the curbside recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| Starting January 2nd, we will no longer be able to accept glass in the curbside household| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| recycling bins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| This is not because we don't want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| I just want everyone to know, some people have asked, we are big recyclers, all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| but it's because of the changes in the recycling market, which have essentially made it impossible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| to sell mixed and mingled and crushed, mixed crushed glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| We can still recycle glass, and we encourage everyone to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| The way we used to, you have to take the glass to the five, you can go to any of the five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| city drop-off centers, where it is separated by color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| So we go back just on the glasses and glass, and that's because of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| And if that ever changes, then we'll change back again, but right now, if you care about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| recycling, you have to take your glass separately, and that's the only way we can assure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| it will be recycled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| So you can get information about all of these changes on the city website at knoxvilletn.gov| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| slash solid waste, or you can call 311, the city's phone number, and they'll explain it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| and help you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| So finally, I want to invite everybody to join me at 11am this Thursday, December 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=422)|
| 0:07:11| for the opening of our newest downtown amenity, public restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| In the year with bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| As councilmembers know, this project has been in the works for a while, and there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| a lot of public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| I think I might have gotten a huge applause at our budget hearing, I mean, at the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| of the city and budget announcement, when we announced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| Will we cut a toilet roll that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Now, don't speculate on that, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| So join us on the ground floor of the Market Square garage, just inside the Wall Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| entrance, and you'll be able to see the result of those new bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| The restrooms will be open daily from 8am to 10pm, and they will stay open later for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| some special events such as New Year's Eve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| Again, that grand opening will be Thursday at 11am, so you won't want to miss that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| And that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Yeah, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| I'm just going to announce that I'm going to have my coffee with the Councilman the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| last Saturday, which is the 31st, at the world-famous Roundup Restaurant, and from 9 until the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| person is heard, generally around noonish, so I invite everyone to come and enjoy some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| fellowship at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| All right, we'll move on to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| 8A is a resolution re-electing Mark Hines and electing Kelsey T. Finch to serve as members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=520)|

| 0:13:49| in their communities, did they realize they were in a prehistoric period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Who defines historic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| I guess it's guys that come later, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| Got to have some writing and history recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| This slide doesn't even really do it justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| Several of you all have seen it in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| It's quite impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| The museum will be open over the Christmas holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| Great parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Students are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Thank you, Dr. Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| We're back to 11, I mean, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| What are we back to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| 9A, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| 9A is an ordinance amending Chapter 21, Article 2, Sections 21-32 and 21-36 of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=876)|
| 0:14:43| City Code streamlining the existing governance structure for the city's transit system by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| dissolving the CAT Community Advisory Committee and transferring public involvement responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| to KTA and CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| You have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Councilman Delevaux, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Is your light still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| I was just wondering, I was looking at the descriptive material and it has one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| appointees on the KTA board as a UT representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| Does that still work now that they've sort of gotten their own bus service and dumped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Yes, actually, we'll ask Dawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| She actually had this question before and I saw her response and I thought it was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| thoughtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| So we do believe it needs it, but Dawn, why don't you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Dawn Dessler, Director of Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Yeah, the UT representative is actually very helpful for us a couple of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| One, the Orange Line Trolley is partially subsidized by the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| They do give us a small stipend to assist us with running that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| And also it helps us with communication with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| We're coordinating services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| And it helps us with talking to Mark Harris, actually the representative from UT, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| allows us to talk to him about any issues that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| He does all the parking special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| So he keeps us in tune of the roads that will be closed on the campus, as well as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| help him with any changes that we're making to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| It makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| We're still a continuing relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| It makes very good sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| 9B is an ordinance amending various sections of Chapter 13, Article 1, Article 2, Article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| 3, Article 4, no, excuse me, not Article 4, Article 5, Article 6, yes, excuse me, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=987)|
| 0:16:36| Article 4, and Article 6 of the Knox City Code to reflect the changes resulting from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| the city purchasing and delivering standardized wheeled garbage and recycling containers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| all city households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| I've obviously received some advice on how, what was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Yeah, a host of articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Looking forward to hearing you read all that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| So did we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| We actually have three people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| So they'll be in this order, Talenda Thomas, oh, I'm sorry, Gene Mathis first, sorry, Gene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| Mathis, and then Talenda Thomas, and then Daniel Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| And please step up and, you know, I'm the timekeeper and we're happy to have you here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| all of you, but we ask you to state your name and address for the record and I'll set the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| My name is 5266 Brig Lane, Knoxville 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| I am president of the Buffett Trace Homeowners Association and I'm here on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| subdivision because with the rollout, we have some definite issues that we don't think were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1057)|
| 0:17:44| really looked at and addressed beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| First of all, we are a 55 plus, 55 plus age development and a number of our people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1067)|
| 0:17:56| definitely past the 55, a number of us are past the 70, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| And the size of the trash can, the 95 gallon, is going to be a major hazard for some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| us, especially some of our widows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| We have quite a bit of elevation in our development and some of those, it will be a hazard for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| them to take a 95 gallon cart down a slope and not be pulled down or pulled down or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1099)|
| 0:18:29| in the process of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| We have, and according to what Chad West and I have been talking, we have in ground garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| containers ever since our development and that was started in 93.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Now, he said those probably shouldn't have been, but look, we've got them and we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| using them and to this day, the garbage people are still pulling trash out of our in ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| And that made sense because these women could take a small garbage bag of garbage at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| and put it in the can and no fear of any slipping or falling or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| I realize it's a hazard for the garbage collectors having to reach down there and pull it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| but that's what we've had and that's what they're used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| Chad has said that, yes, as soon as they roll out all of the other cans, they're going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| to provide us with a smaller cart, 65 gallons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Well, 65 gallons is still going to be large for some of our less than 100 pound, 80 plus years of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1167)|
| 0:19:34| age women and so it is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| The other thing is, the article in the paper said that they had gone to over 20 neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1178)|
| 0:19:48| to discuss this beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| I called Ronnie Collins, who's president of the Alice Bell Spring Hill and as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| nothing like this was brought up to us or I don't understand what might have happened and why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Apparently, there's a rush for time, but had they come to the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| Association, they would have had a representation of definitely older people in Knoxville who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| most all of us, live on slopes and I think they would have found this out initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| had they investigated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| And, of course, the other thing I'm concerned about is the cost factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| We've already purchased 60,000 carts for $2.9 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| I know you're going to save some over the cost of utilizing it, but the thing is, if you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| number of people requesting a smaller cart, you're going to have to up that cost and you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| to have a surplus of the bigger ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| So, those are some of the issues that we in Bucket Trace are concerned about and I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| for you to think about that in the process of pushing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| Yes, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Thank you all for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| My mother is a resident of Buffet Trace Condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| They're PUD condominiums, meaning that they own the inside walls as well as the land that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| condominium sets on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| So, it's a little bit different than what is considered a traditional condominium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| I am the caregiver for my mother's needs and have been for several years, including my dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1283)|
| 0:21:31| who is now deceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| In that period of time, I have learned much about geriatric needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| I've learned a lot about arthritis in the hands and when I heard about this trash collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| program prior to it being announced on TV, I had called to find out what size cans are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1305)|
| 0:21:54| permissible for each resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| I was told that each household could have up to four 32-gallon cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| So, I bought a 32-gallon can for my mother, similar to the ones that you all have just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| purchased for the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| It has the pickup bar and all of that and I did bring some pictures for everyone to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| My concern is with the Buffett Trace condominium, and I concur with the president there, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| the terrain is not suitable to maneuver a 95-gallon can in a senior community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1342)|
| 0:22:32| Since there are slopes, that increases the chances of falling and when you're dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| with seniors falling, that can be quite detrimental, particularly when people have soft bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| My concern is that you all approve a smaller can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| I had suggested, since I've already purchased a can, that allow me to use that when I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| that these new cans have chips in them so that you can identify what residents they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| belong to and I said, hey, you can put a chip in my mother's can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| So, at any rate, I would like to see safety as a priority when it comes to people, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1383)|
| 0:23:11| they're seniors or not, but particularly, I am most concerned, I realize that the newer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| cans have wheels, but you've got to be able to balance that can, tilt it back, balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| it, and then maneuver it in position for them to come through and pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| Someone who has disabilities, who's limited in their strength, whether it be pulmonary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| or whether it be congestive heart failure, that's difficult for them to do, aside from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| the accidental can falling on them and trying to tilt it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| My mother tried to maneuver the empty can that was delivered to her house, and she couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| do it, and it almost fell on her, and it was empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| So that's why I'm here, to see if you all can consider modifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| Chad, I had been in contact with him as well, and he had mentioned that there was a 48-gallon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1437)|
| 0:24:06| can that they were considering, a little smaller than the 65-gallon, and I'm hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| that you all will approve that, because when you're dealing with these residents, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| only one, typically maybe one or two residents per household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| It's not a household that's a large family of four people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| So the amount of trash that they accumulate on a weekly basis is very little, and would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| not fill a 95-gallon can container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| Lastly, there is a form that has to be filled out to qualify for what is called the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| door service, which I think is great if your residential area can accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| But these condominiums are not individually separate from each other, and so that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| that if they're approved to use that service, the city employees that collect the trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| would have difficulty staying on schedule and maneuvering those large 95-gallon cans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1502)|
| 0:25:12| At any rate, the form that has to be filled out, I'm in question about that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| It asks for identifying information that can threaten a person's identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| And there's also medical information that has to be filled out, and so then that becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| a medical document, and you're subject to HIPAA guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| So we need to think about how we're going to manage that type of information when people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| fill it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Thank you very much, Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Her name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| What was her name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| You want to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| What was her name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Oh, Talinda Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| And now Daniel Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Daniel Johnson, 2032 Locarno.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I'm one of the younger residents of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| As Gene knows, I'm probably the youngest homeowner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| I'm also the treasurer of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1549)|
| 0:26:04| But it's just echoing Gene and Talinda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| We have some several residents that are older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| Secondly, what they didn't mention, and just we kind of a little bit, our apologies for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| not getting it all together too quickly, was we really have nowhere to store these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| But it doesn't really quite fit in a one-car garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| And so that was the other issue that we had, was we want to maintain a nice decorum of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| And for a lot of the residents, they can't pull their car in and have this garage, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| trash bin in a certain area or most of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| So Talinda had found, and I'd seen it at Lowe's or Home Depot, one of the big box stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| was about 32 or 40 gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| It may fit also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| And then also seeing the mechanism for grasping the trash can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| It seems like it would be the same, but I don't know what testing has been done or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| But that was just another issue was that residents have called me because they do write their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| check to me, they tend to call me, is that the size and also the safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| So we just really wanted to emphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Sorry for not having further information about it, but we just want to reiterate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| So council, we have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| So Chad is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| I'm going to ask him to address a few of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| We know that what works for the majority does not work for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| And so we're trying to make some adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| So Chad, do you want to address some of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Chad West, Public Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| I have been in conversations with Mr. Mathis prior to tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| And we do understand exactly like you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| We've also had calls from the other side of people saying that they're too small, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| not going to hold enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| So it's the 95 gallons really the standard for the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| And probably 95% of our complaints has been from condo units like Buffett Trace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| So we understand that and we're working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| The issue, as Mr. Johnson just recommended, the smaller cart, again, it is a mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| that picks it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| And the mechanism that picks up the 95 gallon can't pick up a 48 gallon or 32 gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| So that's one of the issues with why we're going with the 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| It cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| It cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| It's just the size of the cart varies too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| It will have no issues with 65 gallon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| I'd also just like to add too that we do have offer backdoor garbage service for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| That is not always ideal in condo units, which we do understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| But anybody that is on our backdoor can do a variation of the cart if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Those are kind of the exception to the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| And also, I just want to add too that we've rolled out 40,000 and our staff has received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| about 160 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| So I do understand that the condo units are having issues with it, but we've also had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| several who really like the carts and we will continue to work with Mr. Mathis and the condo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| units with the 65 gallon carts and whatever else we can do to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| And like I said, I do understand that one cart doesn't work for everybody and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| what we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you, Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Councilman Delevaux, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Do we have budget to adjust by buying different carts that might work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1741)|
| 0:29:10| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| We had always intended on buying some smaller carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| They're actually already on order, so we should have them soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| The 65 gallon carts that we have, we were able to purchase those on state contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| Can you refund or return some of the big boys or are you stuck with what you bought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| We've always, right now we have about 50 requests for smaller carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| Communities like Buffett Trace, I personally drove through several condo communities the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| There's some that have two car garages on the day we rolled out and all but three of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| them were gone in a complex of about 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| What works for some families, too, won't work for the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| We had always anticipated needing some smaller carts, so the budget will be, if we get five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| or six hundred requests, it shouldn't be an issue to switch those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Chad, you said you had 160 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Were those calls for or against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| What was the breakdown on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Unfortunately, most people that are really happy about it don't always call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| I would say that while most of them understand after we explain the reasoning, they always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| most of the time, they understand the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| I would bet 90% of them, again, has been from condo communities, one car garages, as Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| Johnson had said, that they can't get to the back of their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| These HOAs have regulations that state that they can't put their garbage cans outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| We do understand that these are just some of the exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| It's the 95% solution and these 5% of these condo units are what we're really working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Are a lot of them from senior citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Many are from seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Again, they don't really have, back door doesn't help them out much because you can't get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| their back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Seniors in the condo communities concerned with the cart, a lot of people do say, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| fill up the cart, but at the same time, it's the economy of scale, it's the standardization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| it's the modern look for neighborhoods is also a reason why we have a standard 95-gallon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| cart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Again, we tell them if they really have trouble with the cart, as Ms. Thomas mentioned, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| would love for them to be on back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| That's why we have that service to where they don't risk injury putting garbage down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| to the street, taking garbage down to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| There's been several that have been kind of in that 60-year-old age range that maybe don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| quite qualify for back door and have a concern with the cart, but most of them, when we say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=1892)|

| 0:33:41| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=2021)|

| 0:49:42| Mayor, but why can't we do this in-house? We've got the next item, 11-P, we've got someone giving us appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=2982)|

| 0:50:42| this done. We have a real estate agent, Chris Rueberg, in the city's department. So it's part of a process that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| broken up in three phases with right-of-way services, appraisal services, and appraisal review, but all that does get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3047)|

| 0:52:26| Yeah, the park project is substantially complete. However, if you were able to attend the ribbon cutting, you all know it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| beautiful waterfront park, however it had its challenges. And it's pretty standard when we do these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| construction projects. Once you get out in the field, you'll have some unforeseen issues that you run into, and that was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| case in this regard. A lot of times we were just tying in projects. We were in a brownfield area as well, and then we had to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| with some additional drainage and design issues that we met some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| We also had a memorandum of understanding with KUB. It's a new contract that they do under new service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| They looked at the city as a developer, and so we had to do some additional as-builts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| And I know that's pretty technical, but we had to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| As-built drawings of what you put in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| We had to go back and make sure the storm drains and the utilities were at the right elevations once the project was completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| So they could send a crew out to do whatever they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| And it is still within the budget allocated for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| Okay, so we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| I think this is kind of a cool zoo cutout that advertises it along Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| I'm just curious, is it a billboard or what is it classified as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| It's a wayfinding sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| We do have Lisa New, who is the executive director of the Zoo Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| It's got beautiful animals and clever writing and stuff, and it obviously is meant to be attractive to visitors to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| I just didn't know how it fit into our scheme of signage. I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| Lisa, would you like to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| This is gateway signage at the entrance of Rutledge Pike and Timothy Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| and it is going through engineering now with drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| so more substantial than a billboard per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| It is beautiful in and of itself, gateway art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| and has the zoo's logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| It's got a lot of cut images and on a firm foundation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3306)|
| 0:55:15| I don't quite agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| I was just wondering, we struggled probably several months ago with whether someone could have a picture of pies and food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| and stuff on the top of one of the restaurants or bakeries in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| and I just didn't know how this fit in our scheme of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| Like you said, a gateway facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| In that road, Timothy was designated as the main entrance to the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| Right, and it facilitates wayfinding to the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| I wonder if I could ask our master of signage over here, Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| Yes, I'll be glad to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| So do you care to say anything else, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| It's also in the state right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| and governmental signs are, you included in your passage of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| an exception to those rules, particularly wayfinding signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| and particularly signs that are erected by the government to provide information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| So it fits into the signage scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| It's very attractive, I just didn't know how it fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you, Mr. Neal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| All right, so we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| 11S is the resolution approving the annual budget of the Central Business Improvement District for fiscal year 2016-2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| Move for approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| 11T is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| and accept a four-year Internet Crimes Against Children grant in the amount of $960,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| from the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs with no required local match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| for the purpose of employing an organizational strategy to build new partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| with entities and institutions that provide further technological assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| I wonder if the representative of the police department could tell us a bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| We've been doing this for a while, this Internet Crimes Against Children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| How does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| Yes, sir. The Knoxville Police Department is the lead agency for the state in developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| an Internet Crimes Against Children task force for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| And through that, we have gone from about two agencies over a number of years to now we're up to 40 agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| across the state who are part of that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| And equip the different agencies across the state as well as our agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| and our Internet Crimes Against Children task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| Do they share information so that someone can track someone who's moving around or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| Absolutely. And that's nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| 11U is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| with Design and Construction Services Incorporated in an amount not to exceed $239,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| for the removal and replacement of compactor number two and replacement of the current trench drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| great system at the city of Knoxville solid waste transfer facility located at 1033 Elm Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| Move for approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| I think Chad left. So we got David here to bat cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| But I was just curious. It's a pretty expensive object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| Clean up by a little more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| Maybe he's the top of the batting knows about the garbage squisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| Just tell me a little bit about this compactor thing. We obviously replaced one compactor unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| What does it do and why does it cost so much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3561)|
| 0:59:31| This is a large hydraulic cylinder that pushes garbage, compacts it and then pushes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| into a truck so we can take it to the landfill. That facility was renovated in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| So we've gotten more than the life out of the existing compactors. There's two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| This is the one by Baxter Avenue, our transfer facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| There's a big concrete trough you dump your stuff in and this thing moves it out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| There's two pits, pit one and this is pit two. And there's two big hydraulic cylinders that push it and squish it and then push it into the truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| We take it to the landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| It only squishes so long and then you have to replace it. It's squished longer than it probably should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| I expect we'll get another 15 or 20 years out of these compactors and we've already done one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| So we'll do this next one and that facility will be up to speed for the next couple of decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3616)|
| 1:00:31| 12B is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $5,000 from the Parks and Recreation Department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| Grant and Benevolence Fund and donating the same to the Central High School Athletic Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| Move for approval. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| Okay, Council, we have two people signed up for public forum. First is Vivian Scheib and then Doug Stauffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| So Ms. Scheib, you know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Just for the record and I'll time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| Thank you for being here. Vivian Scheib, 109 South Gallaher View, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3666)|
| 1:01:14| Good evening. As we all look forward to the year drawing to a close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| as we look forward to a new year with a clean slate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| it is time to pause for a moment to reflect and to plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| There have been positive events during 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| Many of these we've been waiting on for years to manifest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| On the federal level, the Mental Health Reform Bill has finally passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| On the state level, 2017's legislative session will open with funding for the mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| and those with addictions on the discussion table. It is time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| A few weeks ago, I and other leaders from across the state of Tennessee were able to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| with Lieutenant Governor and the Commissioner of Tennessee's Department of Mental Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| about the need to provide facilities like a safety center all over the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| We heard some startling statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| We, Tennessee, are the fourth worst in the nation with access to mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| Nationally, we of Tennessee are tied 17th for our incarceration rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3746)|
| 1:02:34| Veterans who have mental issues and who get caught up in the jail system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| can have their problems at the VA hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| The question that came up again and again was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| is there participation of city and county in the quest to open such a center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| The affirmative yes cannot be given in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| These centers are going to have to manifest from the bottom up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| We cannot go to the table divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| We need to be of one accord when we ask for state and federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| It is said, that which is a priority to you is where you put your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| If we look at the checkbook ledger of the city, the mentally ill have not been a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3799)|
| 1:03:26| It is time. When you return from your holiday break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| please hear the citizens that you represent and budget in as a recurring expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3811)|
| 1:03:38| the $1 million that the county has already set aside and pledged for a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| It is past time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Thank you. Council, I'll just give you an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| We have been meeting with the county and with McNabb on moving the safety center forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| We have not been requested to put $1 million in at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| but you know that we have budgeted already this year, as did the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| and we have a commitment. We are planning together to go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| As Ms. Scheib acknowledged, the state is a key player in this and the initial funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| so we are coordinating with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| Once we get an idea on whether there will be a commitment from the state and how much that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| that will be as we are developing our budgets for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| Once we are able to commit and what they are asking us to commit, then we will be bringing that to you through the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| We are actively working on this with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| It is a very cooperative relationship right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| I think an important touch point right now is the support from the state as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| Is there a timetable for all this to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| There is a response from the state, but obviously this legislative session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| and then both the city and the county will be moving towards this in our next budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| being able to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| I remember the governor saying when they closed Eastern State or Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| that they were going to try to move those state monies locally so that the issues could be handled there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| and the state process of having institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| I would hope they would step up to the plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| We will be stepping up to the plate, the city and the county, and we are hoping to engage the state as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| I am Doug Stauffer, 5709 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| I want to thank you, Mayor O'Hara, city council members, for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| I hope I don't tire you of my subject area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| We decided it was best for me to come alone tonight, and I want to propose the opportunity for a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| concerning the beer ordinance amended before Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| I hope you will all listen with an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| The city council witnessed a pretty good turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| Knoxville residents present witnessed a misrepresentation of the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| and a vote that ignored their petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| Councilman Stair misrepresented the entire issue when he stated that changing the beer ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| was simply meant to bring the city ordinance in line with the Tennessee state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| Yet the amendment change accomplished nothing of the sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| With the ordinance change, the protection remains intact for schools, daycares, hospitals, and funeral homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4009)|
| 1:06:58| The change that was done only impacted churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| Therefore, this change does not bring the city in line with the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| But that was the only express justification given for the change publicly made by Mr. Stair on November 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4029)|
| 1:07:22| This misrepresentation greatly concerns us, but we have four other issues that we are also concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4042)|
| 1:07:30| Number one, some of the council members vocally belittled those who expressed concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4050)|
| 1:07:36| for the established churches in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| One council member stated she had only heard from a few people from one church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| indicating her understanding that churches did not care about the ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| This is proven overwhelmingly incorrect at the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| although that meeting took place only two days before Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| At the next meeting, Aaron McLean, owner of Craft Bastard Brewery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| revealed that Councilman Grieve frequented his establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| We find this a bit problematic since the councilman twice voted on the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| but was absent in the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| Number four, after the amendment vote, Knoxville is the only large city in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| that does not offer this protection to its churches, so much for being progressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| This includes Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| Knoxville is the only city that has voted against its churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| Even Farragut, Oak Ridge, Lenore City, Morristown, and Athens have these protective barriers in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| In fact, Oak Ridge voted on it in 1999, so much for a Prohibition-era argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| We appreciate the support of the three city council members, Nick Pavlis, Nick DellaVope, and Daniel Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4132)|
| 1:09:00| as they expressed their concerns with removing the protection from churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| Therefore, it is not an issue of just the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| but even some of your city council members believe it is an issue to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| We wondered if there might not be an agenda against established churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| The proposed actions were in no way against churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| but this ordinance change was previously defeated in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| The proposed change at that time was proposed to remove the protective barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| from schools, daycares, hospitals, and funeral homes, along with churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| The ordinance change was defeated because a few school board members and school principals opposed the original change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| The amendment only passed when the focus was limited to removing the protective barrier from churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| Some members of this council have found it easier to ignore pastors and church members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| but won't risk the disdain of those responsible for protecting school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| We want a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| Councilman DellaVope introduced a compromise for fixing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| If the city council truly desires to express their concern and respect for churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4210)|
| 1:10:23| they will move forward by considering and adopting Councilman DellaVope's suggested amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| Regardless of the action, we want respect, safety, and common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| We're not asking for much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| Our proposed compromise would grandfather in existing establishments and limit the implementation to stand-alone churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| which would protect the storefronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4244)|
| 1:10:54| We will actively oppose those with any perceived anti-church, anti-Christian agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| My wife and I will be out of state and out of the country for the month of January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| but we'll get quickly re-engaged when we return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| I've heard a lot of unanimous votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| I would certainly be in favor of one of those when this amendment comes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4274)|
| 1:11:19| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161220?start=4284)|
