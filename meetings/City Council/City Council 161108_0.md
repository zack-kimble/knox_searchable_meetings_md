| 0:03:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| I mean, to December 6th, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| I would like to postpone number 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| Today was the first day I saw a disclosure type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| article in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| And I've started getting a number of emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| And I just think that there hadn't been enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| for the world to digest this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| I just think a two week postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| would be a good idea, just so that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| that want to be heard can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| I will tell you there are several people in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| who've come to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| That'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| I just think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=254)|
| 0:04:14| So if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| Well, can we hear them anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| I mean, if you postpone it now, then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| going to talk about it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| So do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| We can hear them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| And then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| That's whatever council wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| Yeah, I think that's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| I don't want anyone who's traveled here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| prepared to speak to be sent home for another date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| My concern was that a final action on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| without sufficient time for people to get home from work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| read something, have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| would be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| So let's just move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| So you're going to withdraw that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Withdraw the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Withdraw the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| We'll raise it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| I'll withdraw the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| And then we will get to it soon on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| Number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=294)|

| 0:05:05| And anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| We have a 2 of 2 as well, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=312)|

| 0:08:11| What's the address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Put in your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=492)|

| 0:08:15| Do we have an exact address, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=495)|

| 0:08:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Just thought the world might need to know where we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| OK, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Concerning the Veterans Parade, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| have been approached by some of the African-American veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| concerning the displaying of the Confederate flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| during the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| I don't think it's official, but many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| I've noticed in the recent years are displaying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| the flag more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| I know that we have freedom of speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| but it's a very offensive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| It's offensive to me as an African-American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| who fought in Vietnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| And I wish that we would find some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| to ask people at least to refrain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| from displaying that flag during the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| And I might suggest that you also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| talk to the sponsors of the parade, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| I don't know if it's ETMAC, East Tennessee Military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| American Legion Post 2, and it is in the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| and it is prohibited to post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Why don't you come down and-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Ma'am, would you mind addressing us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| since this issue has been raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Jessica King, Commander Women Veterans of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| and member of American Legion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| American Legion Post 2 is the host of the parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| and it is published in the parade rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| if you participate in the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| That is one of the prohibited items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| But if you're sitting on the sideline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| What if they're on the sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| This is just parade participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Just the actual march.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| I'm speaking of parade participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| who display the flag out of their cars through windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| That is prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| It's becoming more and more each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| So I don't know what can be done about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| but something should be done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| The past three years, it has been prohibited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| and I've not seen one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| And I've been at every parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| I see them every year and more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Any other reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| OK, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 4, Article 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Division 2, Section 4-66A of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| relative to distance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| for on-premise beer permits and church buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| OK, so council, we talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| We have some people who are here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| First, we have two people signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| who are in favor of this ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| And that is Aaron McLean and then Rodney Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| And then we have three people who will then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| speak who are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Jack Wallace, Carlos Harmon, and Doug Stauffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| And we'll do it in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| And each person has, when I call your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| you come up, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| And we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| So Mr. McLean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=698)|
| 0:11:49| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| My name is Aaron McLean, 6 Emory Place, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| So I think many of you have gotten to know me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| fairly well by this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| It took me a while to get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| I finally did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| And I came to speak on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| I believe, in March when it was first raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| I'm going to keep my comments short and sweet this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| What I'm going to say is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| I was 292 feet away from a church that wanted us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| And instead of being able to open my business much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| quickly than I could have, I had months and months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| and months of delays, had to fill out mountains of paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| and pay thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| And I still don't have a good understanding of why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| other than that was the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| The other thing I would like to say is, instead of that $3,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| plus going to Nashville to pay TABC agents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| that money instead could have went into my business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| could have went into infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| could have went into equipment, could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| have made my business better and created more tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| revenue for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| The other thing I would like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| is, if I've heard certain council members say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| that this has been on the books for 80 years, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| It's tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| We should respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| We shouldn't rush to overturn things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| But I'd also like to point out that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| been on the books for 80 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| When this ordinance was enacted, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| was a very different time in a very different place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| Now we're starting to see churches locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| in shopping centers, in strip malls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| in areas that are much more congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| The whole idea of a church on the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| is not something that's going to happen for new places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| They're looking to locate into places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| And as the pastor, I'm sorry, I forgot his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| this is hurting churches too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| If I owned a shopping center, I would think long and hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| before I leased to a church, because that is then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| going to put a burden on many other types of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| that would want to locate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| The last thing I want to say is that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| is a very, very different type of culture that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| is found in local breweries and in small businesses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| My place, as Councilman Grieve can attest, is very peaceful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| We've not had any fights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| There isn't any rabble rousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| It's not a den of iniquity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| It's a place where people come, have a few beers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| enjoy themselves, and go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| As I will, the church right across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| many of their patrons are patrons of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| And I would just like to say that the time to move on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| It's best for the churches of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| It's best for the small businesses of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| And I strongly encourage you and ask you to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| And now, Rodney Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=897)|
| 0:15:08| Good evening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=908)|
| 0:15:08| It's good to see you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| Tonight, rather than rehashing the many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| I shared two weeks ago as the pastor of a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| I am in an unusual position for supporting this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=920)|
| 0:15:20| And to be very clear about a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| that I made two weeks ago, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| to share that this has absolutely nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| to do for me and the now more than 15 churches that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| have spoken with and pastors that are in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| It has nothing to do with theology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| It has nothing to do with a biblical interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| In fact, my background is one where I grew up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| being taught as a teetotaler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| It's wrong to drink alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| I even joked with our church on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| I was taught growing up that the wine in scripture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| was grape juice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| So we were just that teetotalers as I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| Many of the churches that are represented in the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| that I sent to council have a teetotal viewpoint of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| In fact, one of the churches that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| is represented by me being here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| requires their staff to sign a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| that if I'm on staff at this church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| I will not partake in alcohol whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| I say all that to underscore the reality for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| that this is not an issue of theology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| It's an issue that the ordinance as written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| does not protect churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| If the ordinance as written protected churches in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| I may be standing here with a completely different viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| But the reality is with the law as it currently stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| you know this, but I'd just like to go on record and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| churches right now are located within 50 feet of convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| stores selling beer every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| My wife made a joking comment in thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| She said, well, let me ask you, would you either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| have a mom and pop's convenience store near your church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| or a Chuck E. Cheese?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Because a Chuck E. Cheese would be prevented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| The Pizza Inn would be prevented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| But the convenience store where someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| could go and buy for off-premises consumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| would be within 50 feet of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| The other reality is the current state liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| if purchased, as the gentleman just shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| negates the city law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| So Mr. Pavlis, I thought about something he shared last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| He gave a very impassioned example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| of what he wanted to avoid, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| was not being able to imagine it's noon on a Sunday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| and the service is wrapping up and the bar next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| gets rowdy and begins to make noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| The reality is, I started thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| I actually agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| But the ordinance as written doesn't stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| The ordinance as written allows that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| because the state liquor license overrides the city rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| But what it doesn't override is this gentleman's experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| where a landlord has to decide, am I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| going to kick a church out so that I can keep a beer selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| establishment who may not want to or be able to afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| the state liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| This issue has actually been made very public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| as far as I'm aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| It was in the news previous to two weeks ago's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| It was in the news the following day, two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| It was in the news yesterday and today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| And I would contend, if council hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| gotten a lot of feedback, that would say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| I, in fact, wanted to be very open with our church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| and wrote a blog post, which is the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| that we communicate a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| And it got shared to over 10,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| We only have 10,000 people at our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| And it got nothing but positive remarks from saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| you know what, I understand now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| This isn't about trying to argue theology or a biblical stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| This is about, it makes it very difficult for churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| to find facilities, because landlords simply won't lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| or developers won't sell to churches because of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| The state of the church is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| I just left a meeting with eight pastors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| who are planning churches all around our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| in the coming couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| And they're going to be meeting in all kinds of crazy places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| One is going to be meeting in a hair salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| They're going to be meeting in homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| They're going to be meeting in banquet facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Another concern that I have is the ordinance as written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| would define each of those places as a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| So now someone's home is a church within 300 feet of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| Now someone's hair salon is a church within 300 feet of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| And then they're going to go, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| going to outgrow that home or that hair salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| And they're going to need to rent the old abandoned food city as we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| or the old just-for-feet building as we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| And they're going to be told no by a developer or a landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| This doesn't protect churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| The ordinance that protects us is the one that will stay on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| And I think it's a great one, which is that alcohol may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| be sold on Sunday mornings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| I think that's a great protection for churches and should stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| But the ordinance as it stands now does not protect churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| It's actually hurting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| And it's why I and the now 15 churches that I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| do ask you to continue to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1185)|
| 0:19:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Now, Jack Wallace, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1187)|
| 0:19:57| First, thank you for allowing me to speak to city council today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| I'm a member of Oakwood Baptist Church and a deacon there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| on Central, at the corner of Central and Columbia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| We're considered an inner-city church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| I've made some notes here that I'll try to fumble through and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| a few points I'd like to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| And I'm opposed to lifting the 300-foot barrier between the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1214)|
| 0:20:22| and existing sales of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| And I just wonder if you've stepped outside to see how far 300 feet is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| If I stand in my mailbox and look at two mailboxes down, that's 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| That's not really enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| 300 feet's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| And it should be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| But I know that there are 11, 12 churches that have come before you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1242)|
| 0:20:53| And I assume that they will make it easier for them to move into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| standalone malls or our big malls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| And I'm not interested in protecting landlords and protecting alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1262)|
| 0:21:12| and protecting the places that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| I'm interested in protecting our many neighborhood churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| in the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| These churches are of all race and beliefs and have had a major role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| in defining Knoxville, Tennessee and helping us to understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| we want to live here and work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| I know it'll be a great task to convince you to vote against the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| And we have two council members who had already spoke out and given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| some concerns about not having enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| And I'm so glad to have it put off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| I thought maybe I'd have another couple of weeks to practice my speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| My church is on the outskirts of Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| And there are other churches on the outskirts of Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| And with that in mind, I took a little road trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| I left City Hall and went out Broadway to the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| came back, it's not very far, came back to the City Hall down central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| Then I took a little trip out Middlebrook Pike, not very far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| turned around, came back on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| And there are, I counted driving, trying to drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| we counted 34 churches right on those four little places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| That's not any secondary roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| That didn't take in all of East Knoxville where Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| and there are many, many neighborhood churches in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| And we have, at our church, we have an empty lot right across the street from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| We have some down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| And what we're looking forward to is maybe having a local tavern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| across the street and an outside patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| And I think that many of these churches on the major roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| are going to look at that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| What's good for some people is not too good for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| And we've been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| Our church is over 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| And it becomes very discouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| I'm sure that a lot of our citizens weren't aware that this was coming about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| I'll give you one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| There's a whole section about churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| The lead on top says, Beer Board Advances Buffer Removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| It doesn't say anything at all about church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| And I read the paper daily, and if I had not read closer, I wouldn't have known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| Nobody that I've talked to in other churches that I work in a ministry downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| and we've talked, and nobody knows anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| I guess it's because a lot of them are seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| They don't have computers, or they're not social media savvy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| And that restricts sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| We don't have newspapers now, I think, about $100 for three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| So sometimes it's cost restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| But I'll jump to, we had one thing I wanted to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| We had one council person mention that she was going to vote for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| because she hadn't received any phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| And I thought, you know, that ought to ring a bell right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| If you haven't had any calls for 400 or 500 churches, something's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| And I think we've had some people that recognize that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Not too long ago, we spent meeting and meeting and meeting and months trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| to decide whether you could have a six-foot sign or a 12-foot sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| and what kind of bulbs to put in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| And I think our churches deserve a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Now, Carlos Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| My name is Carlos Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| I live at 814 Atlantic Avenue in the Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| I'm a lifelong resident of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| And I beg for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| This is the first time I've stood before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| So some of you probably received an email from me, potentially, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| I did not know whether I was going to be allowed to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| considering the three-person limit that I was informed about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| So if you have read this, then you will hear something very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| And perhaps I will expand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| And if I do, I pray for your forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| As a citizen of Knoxville who has lived, worked, and worshipped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| in the Fifth District for my entire life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| I'd like to express my opposition to the proposed removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| of the 300-foot distance requirement for the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| obtaining a beer permit near churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| Based on my education and more than 20 years of experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| working in the criminal justice system in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| I wholeheartedly agree with Councilman Pavlis's assertion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| that the removal of this buffer would have unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| for local churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| In the short term, the removal of this buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| might make it more advantageous for some congregations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| to expand their churches in non-traditional locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| by limiting the need for property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| to choose between renting and selling property to a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| or selling and renting property to an establishment that serves alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| Of course, this decision is presently possible with the buffer in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| It's simply more expensive to the businesses choosing to serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| And I realize that there is a lot of red tape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| that has to be waded through with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| as the gentleman spoke to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| It's easy to see that the argument for removing this buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| when considering locating a church near a non-traditional setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| however, this impacts relatively few churches in a positive manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| Many existing churches in the Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| are located near existing commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| That would suddenly be eligible then to become businesses selling alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| It's doubtful that these churches would favor a bar or liquor store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| opening across the street or next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| The removal of the buffer zone, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| is a very short-sighted decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| that weighs the needs of the few over the needs of the many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| In my work with a population that allows me to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| the devastating impact of alcohol consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| it is not difficult to play the scenario forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| and foresee some of these consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Public drunkenness is the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| and the easiest consequence that can be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| While generally seen as a nuisance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| most people find dealing with public drunkenness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| very uncomfortable at the least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| but it can lead down more undesirable paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| Alcohol reduces inhibitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| increases the likelihood of poor choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| These choices are best seen in the increased instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| of aggressive panhandling, assault, vandalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| and driving under the influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| associated with alcohol consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Is it a really smart choice to allow these businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| to locate within 300 feet of a church where children are present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Why is it acceptable to remove this buffer only from churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| and leave it in place for schools and daycare centers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Children are just as present and just as vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| in a church setting as they are in a school or daycare setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| Many churches, in fact, now incorporate a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| or a daycare center as a part of their ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| while others host Boy Scout troops, Girl Scout troops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| sports practices, and youth ministries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| that meet throughout the week and evenings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| that are not on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| How would this distinction be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| under this new buffer elimination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Councilwoman Palmer expressed the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| that it is unfair to allow churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| a special event permit for selling alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| while at the same time disallowing businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| the same right because they are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| within 300 feet of a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| I agree. That is unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| The simple solution to this unfair situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| is to stop granting churches permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| to serve alcohol on church grounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| thus eliminating the inequity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Is it fair to impact over 400 churches in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| based on the desire of a handful to serve alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| or locate somewhere that might want to locate a bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| or another establishment that serves alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| In conclusion, I would urge the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| to please consider the long-term impact of the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| that we must certainly have on our community, our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| and choose to consider the needs of the many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| or the needs of the few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| Concerning the situations as far as possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| even strengthening this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| You have one minute, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Possibly even consider strengthening this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| I had a discussion with Councilman Steyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| about maybe trying to reverse the loophole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| maybe making this something that we would be working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| in conjunction with some folks to get the state on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| with enforcing that buffer to, again, protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| even expand that buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| But, again, I thank you for your time and for your service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| and have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Now, Doug Stauffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| My name is Doug Stauffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| I am representing Antioch Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| 5709 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| I'm about 12 pages of notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| didn't know about the five-minute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| I will do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| I have CDC statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| I have a number of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| including the other cities that are around us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| the largest cities that have these stipulations in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| I'm going to send all of you an email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| including the news, on my findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| I'll start with the Centers for Disease Control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| We all know excessive alcohol use leads to about 88,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| this is studies by them, 88,000 deaths per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| shortening the lives of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| who have died by an average of 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| There are about 2.5 million years of potential life lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| due to excessive alcohol use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| It costs $223 billion per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| This is the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| They gave a list of suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| I'm only going to read one of the suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| out of the very many, but it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| reducing the number of retail outlets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| that sell alcoholic drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| I know we're just talking about beer here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| so I looked at the laws for getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| a Tennessee Alcohol Beverage Commission permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| They are very stringent, can cost you up to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| This is not a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| This is somebody deciding they're going to sell alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| and they better be committed before they do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| in more ways than one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| but they are there for the long haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| We're not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| We're talking about the place next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| like the one that opened next to our church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| and had to stop selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| because of the very ordinance that you have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| We're asking you to leave that ordinance in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| We just spent $600,000 putting in an elevator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| for our elderly, putting in a playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| for our children and a basketball area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| If the businesses next door open up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| and they're able to sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| I mean, they're already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| If they sell beer, it's going to impact us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| and it's going to endanger our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| We cannot allow this thing to be changed to help the few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| You open up in a shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| You don't like your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| You leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| We're here to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| We're asking for you to look at the established churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| and say no to this amendment change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| It has only been on the books since 1962,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| not since Prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| That's 55 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| To link it to Prohibition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| although I'm not completely against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| what Prohibition tried to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| it was just a mistake in what they were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| because they couldn't enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| I know we're not trying to legislate morality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| When I read my Bible, it says in Proverbs 20, verse one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| Whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| That's what I personally believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| For those churches that are trying to sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| the Bible says in Habakkuk 2.15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| that putteth thy bottle to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| and makest him drunken also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| That's an admonition to churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| that are trying to get this thing changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| for their benefit to be able to sell the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| The Bible is explicitly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| it explicitly says it should not be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| We're asking you to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| We're asking you to allow us to send our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| to the playground in our church facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| put them on the basketball court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| and not take a bigger chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| of having inebriated people walking across our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| because they use our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| to get from the back to the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| to get to North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| They walk across it, we have no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| We don't want to put up fences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| We don't want to fence people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| We want to allow them to walk across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| We have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| But if they're going across to get beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| buy beer, drink beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| because it's made easily accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| in those buildings that are next to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| then we've got a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| And we're just asking you to leave the statute as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| Well, I told you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| I told you that there are cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| And again, I'm going to send you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I've got all the footnotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| I've got the website addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Let me close with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| are the four largest cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| All four of them have statutes against selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| within a certain distance from a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| All four of the major cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| So Knoxville isn't behind the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Then you go and you look at Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| In fact, Chattanooga has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| It's 200 feet for off-premises consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| 500 feet for on-premise consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| You know what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| That's saying if you're staying there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| we don't want you leaving there drunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| and harming the people of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| That's what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Farragut, 340 foot requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| Oak Ridge, 250 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Lenoir City, 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Morristown, 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Athens, 300 to 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Now I want to close with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Greenville has no restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| So this is from the Greenville Sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| Beer permit okayed for store despite opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| from the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| You know that if you change this thing, we cannot fight it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| You cannot fight it because they can take you to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| and sue you and your statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| your ordinance must be obeyed by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| We're just asking you to leave it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| It's been on the books 55 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| It has helped our church personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| You've heard it will help other churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Let's keep it and leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| Okay, we've heard all of those who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2093)|
| 0:35:01| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Again, I think that while this council could go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| I think that in fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| not everyone really is as aware as they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| We talked about having an open workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| with special invitations to churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| and that was dropped at the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Just today, the New Sentinel took the online piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| it wrote yesterday and put it in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Some people are just getting home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| to read their newspaper now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| I think there's not enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| I think Mike Steely might have written something on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| but it hadn't been out there that long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| and that well noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| And I think in fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| there's no urgency not to have it put off for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| so that people can digest this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Maybe there won't be any change in result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| or in the dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| but I think fairness demands an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| to see this, learn about it, digest it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| speak your mind if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| I'm asking that we move it two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| So that's your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Dan second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Okay, we have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| I don't have any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| You know, however it was on the agenda back in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| and we talked about it then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| and you know, when we had discussion about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| and there were articles written about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| you know, you go back to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| and it's fine, we can postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| I mean, there's no urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| It's been there for 50 some odd years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| There's no rush to for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| But again, the premise is that you can and people do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| and we've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| The church I attend, Cedar Springs Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Carolina Ale, went across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| They got their liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| They got their beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| They have an outdoor patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| They're on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| I mean, they got it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| So we're not stopping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| you're not stopping the sale of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| And you're not, I mean, we're certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| I'm not for drunk driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| I'm against drunk driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| I'm against, you know, over serving of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| That's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| The point is that you're trying to be fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| to these businesses as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| that they can, that we sit here at beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| and we say, well, you're in the distance requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| but wait a minute, here's the loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| You go down, you pay your $5,000, up to $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| and get your liquor license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| and come back and get your beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| And it's aligning our local law with the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| That's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| And it's essentially, there's no buffer there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| if you follow all the red tape at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| So, but I have no problem seconding it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| and postponing it for two weeks as you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| and hear more, to hear more discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| All right, at that point, then everyone knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| and if we want to approve it, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| I mean, I'm probably gonna vote against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| We did talk about this in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| It has been well publicized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| I think we haven't heard a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| because the reality is this change really doesn't do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| And I think once people hear that and understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| then they think, oh, well, I guess it's not that big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| When you first see the headlines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| like the headlines are heard on the radio this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| council eliminates the 300 foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Well, that gives you the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| that there's a 300 foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| Well, there's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| Any business can go and get the liquor permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| and then they get the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| So you can sell liquor and beer right next to churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| schools, funeral homes, and hospitals today in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| This is changing the process in a small way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| eliminating the churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| So that's why I think we haven't heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| and I've tried to respond to every email I've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| explaining that it is exactly like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| Council Member Wallace said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| I mean, we're just making this congruous with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| or aligning with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| So there's no distance requirement for liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| It obviously doesn't make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| that a place could sell liquor and not beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| So until that changes, I think it just makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| to go ahead and vote on it and vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| And again, this is not something I ran for council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| to change or anything, but it's a common sense thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| If we postpone it, it's not that big a deal either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| I agree with Councilman Thayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| When we first talked about this some months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| I thought, oh, we will have every church in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| at our doorstep complaining about the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Well, as a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| there hasn't been a lot of complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| We've heard from, I think I've heard from seven people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| from the same church, one person who lives in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| and another person who lives someplace in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| But I haven't heard from a variety of churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| or other kinds of religious institutions opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| I remember when Mr. McLean came looking for a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| for his brewery, I was real unhappy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| that it was just seven feet too close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| And the more I've thought about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| and the fact that you can go to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| get the TABC permit and come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| it really makes us look not so sharp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| if we're telling people that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| well, we can't grant you the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| but you can go to the state and pay three to $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| get a permit, and then we'll have to let you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| That's not such a good move on our part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| and it doesn't make us look very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| So I will be opposed to postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| We need to go ahead and get it settled and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2476)|
| 0:41:16| I agree with Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| One thing that I didn't realize also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| is that that's a yearly charge, is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| that they pay three to $5,000 each year to have that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| And I can vouch for the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| with the establishment next door to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| the one that we were referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| that was six feet or eight feet short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| it's really the whole culture, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| is changing from the standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| that that's a real neighborhood establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| It's a neighborhood gathering place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| And as he pointed out, it's been very peaceful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| It's been very quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| They've been great neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| And so I think there's always that possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| that some things could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| but I will have to say that I've certainly changed my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| over the last several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| in terms of having the distance requirement done away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| So I will not support it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| Council, we now, the motion before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| is a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| Vote aye if you want to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2540)|

| 0:42:33| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2553)|

| 0:42:43| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Okay, the motion to postpone passes five to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| so we will take this up again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| 11A is a resolution moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2573)|

| 0:43:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2600)|

| 0:43:24| Yay!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| 11C is a resolution respectfully requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| to consider and make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| to city council regarding limiting, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| limited revisions to the city sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| pertaining to signs for hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| which offer inpatient overnight emergency care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| potential housekeeping revisions pertaining to content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| and neutral regulation, and the potential establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| of an entertainment overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| And we have one person signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Do you want to speak first, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Yeah, I just wanted to ask our legal counsel is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| there's two subjects in this storyline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| One is getting MPC to look at various parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| of the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| The other one is to set up a zoning overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| Shouldn't they be voted on separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| or does it not matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Maybe it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Well, I mean, I guess a motion to divide the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| would be allowable, appropriate, if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| or you can, if there's some issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| or you can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| No, I don't know if there's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| I just didn't know if you could combine two and one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| It looks a little confusing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Actually, my understanding is the overlay district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| has to do with signs, and only the use of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| in a particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| So it is related specifically to signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| It's not creating some separate zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| So are those the only aspects of the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| that they're able to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| There's no other, they can't come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| with any other recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| Well, they can always come to you with recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| that they initiate themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| We're not asking them to review the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| You're not asking them to evaluate anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| We're just asking them to look at those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| and, okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2714)|
| 0:45:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Your heart's okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| My heart's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| I think you need two years of hearings to clear up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| At least we're gonna make you chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Ms. Joyce Feld is here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2723)|
| 0:45:29| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| 37919, and I'm here tonight as president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| And as you well know, it's only been a little over a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| that since we brought closure to a pretty long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| drawn out, three and a half years to be specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| and highly contentious process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| of crafting a new sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| I'm very concerned, or we're very concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| that this is going to open a big can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| You know, we didn't get everything we wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| The chamber didn't get everything they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| in the ordinance, and lots of people in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| and our concern is that if you open this back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| you're going to have a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| probably Scenic Knoxville included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| trying to go back and get things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| that they would like to have in the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| or get things deleted, see changes they want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| I think the ordinance is working pretty well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| and I don't see a good reason to open this back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| So we recommend that you don't support the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| or that you somehow manage to put enough restrictions on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| that this can of worms is not going to be opened back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| But I think, I don't know how you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Councilman Delamont, oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| You've already spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2824)|
| 0:47:04| Your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Yeah, let me go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Yeah, I mean, it's, and I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| the concern of Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| and I think that's fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| but I can assure you that, well, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Number one, it has been over a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| and I can remember during the process that we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| I think it was a living, breathing document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| and it was just the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| and I think it's, after a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| you know, things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| Some things have evolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| and some obvious things have come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Housekeeping issues with the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| that I don't think will be controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| But I do think that it's reasonable for us to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| as we grow as a city, and as we drive through our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| up and down particular areas in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| that are really starting to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| and I think become an entertainment district, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| And that is solely my intent, is just to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| I don't have any idea what MPC would even bring back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| but it's certainly not my intent to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| and try to rehash what a hotel sign can look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| going 60 miles an hour down the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| I mean, we finished that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| and we've got the ordinance on the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| and this resolution is certainly not going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| I have no intent, I don't have enough time left on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| to go back and do that, just to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| but it's certainly not the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| of this action here to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| It's just purely, I think you'd have to have blinders on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| in this city now to not see the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| of entertainment districts like we see in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| like we see in Memphis, like we see in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| in like cities all throughout the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| So I can assure these, I mean, I'm on record here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| that's the only thing that I wanna look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| I have no idea what they'll bring back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| but I think it's worth the opportunity before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| to go and look and just listen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| I mean, listen to what they could bring back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| Gerald, the way he indicated, was familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| and he had dealt with it in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| So that's all I ask is that we just at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| explore the opportunity of an entertainment district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| and then we'll have to figure out what that looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| should it pass through the council this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| Councilman Dilanopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| I was gonna ask Mr. Pavlis, what was the hospital thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| That was the first thing that leaped out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| and it was about special plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| special signage for hospitals with emergency care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| Was that Middlebrook Pike and Tenova or something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Yes, I mean, that was the concern back, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| My second question was, I hope you weren't thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| of Las Vegas signs as an entertainment district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| but that's, it'll be what it'll be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| Again, with, you know, when I spoke with Gerald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| and I think he would substantiate what I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| is that two or three bars or restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| up and down Chapman Highway or Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| or wherever it might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| does not constitute an entertainment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| We know what that would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| It'd be a defined thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Right, and it would be only to such area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| and you would have to meet whatever requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| I'm gonna support this because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| I actually tried to engraft an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| when we were doing the original one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| saying let's come back in a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| and have a report from our enforcement team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| to find out how it's working and what ain't right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| and what's broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| This is a whole new big ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| and I can see where there might be a few bumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| in the road in terms of managing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| I don't have a problem with ignoring MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| if they go crazy, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| No, that's exactly right, and I think Peter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| I don't think he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| Take note, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3079)|
| 0:51:19| I don't think Peter's here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| but he has some specific, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| he has some things that he's gonna recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| As our, Mr. Swanson likes to call it housekeeping issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| If you live with this, you're gonna have problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| about how it really works logistically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| and those ought to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Vice Mayor Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| First of all, I want to say that Councilman Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| called me about this before instituting the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| or having it even go to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| and he did express to me the concern that he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| over the fact of the entertainment district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| and then also about the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| And also, and I do agree that when we finally passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| after three and a half years the signed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| that I did say that it does need to be put into action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| Let's get something on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Let's see how it goes, and then when necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| there will be tweaks that'll have to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| and there's gonna be tweaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| just like Ms. Fels talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| that in the future could be looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| but I was assured by Councilman Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| that really what he's looking at is in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| if we have entertainment districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| how do we deal with those when it comes to signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| If you think about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Cumberland Avenue has certain requirements for signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| because of what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| and so I think that if we make this specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| to the fact that that's what we're gonna look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| that's one of the first things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| that we're gonna take a look at an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| that we spent an enormous amount of time to create,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| one that is working, it does appear to be working well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| and so definitely I think that we can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| that this is what we wanna see, you know, in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Well, I can, Nick, I can go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| They're not looking at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| They're only looking at these three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| If there's other things that aren't working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| or, you know, that we're having problems with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| they're not going back and looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| and that's, I guess, just have to make that really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| I'll bring that up next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| You can bring it up next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| but I guess we have already made changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| to the signed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| and does it need to go to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| just to address the hospital signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| And I guess that's my question to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| Does that need to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| can't we just bring that as an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| or do we have to go back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Not without going to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Well, we've made changes already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| We made changes to the shopping center sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| We made changes to that a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| You have to show that it has been studied by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| before you can make a change to your zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| We can act first, but they still have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| I don't think, did we make changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| We made a variance request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| We made a change to the director's sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| That was a variance request, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| I think we made a change to the director's sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Did we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| I'm not familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Must be another meeting I meet every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| That doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3255)|
| 0:54:15| I think you're seeing signs now is what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| I'm probably seeing signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Yes, my question to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| What kind of timeline are we looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| in terms of getting back to council with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| Council, Dan Kelly with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| I talked with Director Green this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| about this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| We try very hard to address the requests of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| as you pass these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| We do have an approved work program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| and we are working very hard at trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| to accomplish the work program that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| We will take up this matter as time permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| unless directed otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| But at this point, our resources are probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| going to be devoted more toward the comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| rewrite of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| because of the amount of staff time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| that's going to be going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| We understand what council is asking for here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| and if we have the time to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| we will be more than happy to address it though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Councilman Dela Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| I don't have, it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| Oh, I'm sorry, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Thank you. Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Part of the, one of the things in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| is as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| Reed versus the town of Gilbert, Arizona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| That's really something that's going to be crafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| more by the law department that really won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| I mean, MPC will be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| but in a minor role, relatively speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| As council may recall, when sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| was being debated, this Supreme Court case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| the opinion was released and it kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| you know, a little hiccup in the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| we had things going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| So having had the opportunity to review the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| we think that there might need to be some minor revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| It's nothing substantive, square footage of signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| setbacks or anything like that though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| You said it had to be content neutral, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| You couldn't regulate speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| I'm going to support the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| but I was just guessing need a little better explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| on entertainment overlay districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| and how, what's sort of the idea there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| Well, again, I think as you go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| you drive through Knoxville and you're starting to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| areas that are thriving with restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| with entertainment venues and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| the craft beer is really going great guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| And I think that though, and when I travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| and go to these areas, they sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| have a different feel to them and a different look to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| than just regular going down a road or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| But, you know, again, and I've said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| I don't know exactly what that would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| I'm not a planner, but I do know that this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| is evolving into potentially a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| or you know, entertainment districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| And I think they have a different feel to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| and it could have a different look to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| I'm not talking about like as Councilman De La Vope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| he says in Las Vegas, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| Palm trees and flashy girls or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| And Trump plazas, but just, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| So, I mean, I know that that answer is a little vague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| but again, I just don't know exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| To like match the signs or make them smaller or bigger or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| Well, he doesn't know, he doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| That's what he's gonna, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Happy Holler has the potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| I'm not saying it is yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| but Happy Holler has the potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| And so if that's a possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| is there a way to regulate certain signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| or are those signs gonna be a bit different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| But as Nick's pointed out, he's putting this on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| have MPC look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| What are other cities doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| But you're actually trying to look to the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| to say Knoxville is growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| and Knoxville is producing different areas around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| And so should, you're not saying they have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| but should those areas have a certain sign requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| just like Cumberland Avenue has a certain requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| for signs that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| And so is it possible to have an entertainment area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| And so, you know, again, it's looking to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| It's not saying that we have that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| And then whatever they come back with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| I mean, you've got to vet it just like we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| with the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| I'm all for entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Except it won't be three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| It won't be three years worth, I promise you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| Okay, so we have a motion and a second, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| To pass 11C, are you all ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3558)|

| 1:03:47| Yeah, just curious, maybe someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| Vicki or Mr. Lyons can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| I don't know if Vicki's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Ms. Hatfield's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Oh, she is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Dr. Hatfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3839)|
| 1:03:59| One of the items, number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| was an automatic updating of salary compensation levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| every three years under some mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| I was just wondering if that's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| to have something on autopilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| and maybe it gets out of control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| and we don't even see it happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| So what's the purpose of that automatic provision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| Well, those were the Department of Labor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| recommendations, so we didn't get a whole lot of say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| But they did, the initial recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| from the Department of Labor were much less favorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| than these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| I will say that as they went through the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| comment period between July and September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| it did soften up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| The impact to us would have been greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| This was the final agreement that was settled on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| by the Department of Labor and that is effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| whether we like it or not, December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| That pretty much does it for me, we have no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| So basically, they're just gonna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| instead of going a very long time like we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| you can see how big, I mean, the move is huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| so they don't wanna see us in that boat again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| And this goal is to find out who should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| in the category of employee subject to overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| as opposed to some management exemption or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| They basically raised that salary threshold significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| and that'll go up automatically every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| Yeah, we'll keep moving up every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| So we'll just have to stay on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| I'll try not to take on the Department of Labor today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| I had a question before you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| I think I saw in the packet as far as the minimum wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| for general service, did it go up from seven something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| to eight something, is that what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| We did have one position that was in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| it's what we call our events payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Those are a limited number of positions we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| in the city that are just paid on an hourly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| or event basis for seasonal or part-time workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| And one of those rates was changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| that was a request from public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| for the Second Chances Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| I see, so that would be just for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| I should say seasonal or part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| It's primarily for those second chance workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| that are being hired into the public service department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| So regular employees now, what is the minimum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| I wanna say 10.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| 10.75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=3985)|

| 1:08:59| Mayor, can I ask one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| Could we ask the MPC folks to explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| we had two approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| The applicant wanted a C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| and they thought an office district was better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| but could Mr. Kelly just tell us the thinking there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| on the staff's level as to why we wanted an office level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| The building that's in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| or the property that is in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| is a commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| The building used to be the training center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| for the Boilermakers Union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| when they were at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| It is definitely a commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Its potential use for residential would be fairly limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| There is other commercially zoned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| in the immediate vicinity that is vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| and could easily be developed for commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| This piece of property is surrounded by residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| and we believe that by changing this commercial building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| to an office zoning classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| would give the property owner a viable use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| for their property and at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| not have a negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| on the surrounding residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| Offices are transition zoned pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| So it protects the residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161108?start=4213)|
