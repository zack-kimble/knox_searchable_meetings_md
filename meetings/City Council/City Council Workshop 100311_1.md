| 2:44:10| We bought this property from people willing to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9850)|
| 2:44:13| It is in the planned growth area, which has meant that it was intended for more intense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9853)|
| 2:44:20| It was originally in the sector plan right now for residential and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9860)|
| 2:44:28| I think this has no more significant impact on potential traffic into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9868)|
| 2:44:33| and proliferation of residential into the areas beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9873)|
| 2:44:37| The sector plan that you're being asked to consider that MPC has approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9877)|
| 2:44:42| doesn't show the proliferation of residential development above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9882)|
| 2:44:45| And in the rural area right now, on septic tank systems, not what we're talking about doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| I think the density is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| What's the density on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| Is it one per half acre in rural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| It's one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9898)|
| 2:44:59| One per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| And a lot of the property looks like two or three acres at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| I mean, they seem to be bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| I'm just saying those things could already happen and probably less likely so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| at least on the property that we've got because of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| So this wastewater, and all those utilities are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9912)|
| 2:45:17| The only one that's not there is an on-site wastewater treatment system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9917)|
| 2:45:21| which will just serve the business part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| So this doesn't proliferate any more utilities that are already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9923)|
| 2:45:27| except to take care of our own needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| What about electrical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9930)|
| 2:45:31| There's a substation to be built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9931)|
| 2:45:34| There is a switchyard and a KU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9934)|
| 2:45:40| It's a switchyard for TVA and an infeed station for KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9940)|
| 2:45:46| Is that for the business part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9946)|
| 2:45:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9947)|
| 2:45:48| It's going to happen regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9948)|
| 2:45:50| Maybe Mr. Donaldson could address that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| because I think that's one of the big reservations here that people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9953)|
| 2:45:57| And I don't know of anyone in this room that doesn't want to have jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| and good growth for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| but we also don't want to destroy both a lifestyle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9962)|
| 2:46:05| and an attraction to our area of natural beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9965)|
| 2:46:09| If you could address the expansion question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| That question gets back to the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| which was adopted in 2001 after the last version of the East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9975)|
| 2:46:21| and sets up that designation of rural planned growth and urban growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9981)|
| 2:46:29| In the East County Sector, 52% of all of the land area is designated as rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9989)|
| 2:46:37| so growth is controlled there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=9997)|
| 2:46:40| Densities are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10000)|
| 2:46:42| Any residential development will be extremely low in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10002)|
| 2:46:47| The rural area bounds the Midway intersection on two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10007)|
| 2:46:54| To the east of it, towards the old Thorn Grove community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| it's rural, and south of the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| with the exception of a couple of the parcels right on the interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| are designated rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| On the northwest side of the proposed business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10025)|
| 2:47:09| is an already developed large lot subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| So it literally is bounded by rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10034)|
| 2:47:22| The growth policy plan has worked since its inception in 2001| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10042)|
| 2:47:28| with its primary function being the stopping of annexations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10048)|
| 2:47:34| Those involuntary annexations have stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10054)|
| 2:47:37| With regard to the growth patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10057)|
| 2:47:39| the primary goal of the policy plan was to direct growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10059)|
| 2:47:44| to the planned growth and urban growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| The rural area countywide is 40% of the land area in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10068)|
| 2:47:54| and the urban growth area and the planned growth area are roughly 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10074)|
| 2:47:59| Since 2001, 87% of all of the building permits issued in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10079)|
| 2:48:05| have been within the planned and urban growth areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| so only 13% of the residential development is occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| in 40% of the land area at extremely low densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10091)|
| 2:48:15| Right, and I appreciate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| but I guess the question is the plans are pieces of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| and we use them to hopefully guide our future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| but if I'm picturing 2,000 or 3,000 workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10103)|
| 2:48:26| who don't want to get on the road and commute every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| isn't the natural inclination to try to build and sell them houses nearby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10109)|
| 2:48:34| and take up the land base that is currently rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10114)|
| 2:48:37| and put that growth pressure to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| That's kind of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10119)|
| 2:48:40| How do we see that working out if we could put our magic forecast eyes on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10120)|
| 2:48:46| As I mentioned in 2001, the growth policy plan boundaries have not been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| So they're prohibited from doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10131)|
| 2:48:53| There is a process that can be done to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10133)|
| 2:48:57| It requires the mayors recreating the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10137)|
| 2:49:03| and going through a full analysis again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10143)|
| 2:49:05| That just hasn't happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| and we are now nine years into a 20-year program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10148)|
| 2:49:13| and we are kind of behind our growth curves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10153)|
| 2:49:17| as far as utilizing the land within the planned growth and urban growth areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10157)|
| 2:49:22| Of course, the flip side of that was his question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10162)|
| 2:49:24| about if you found a way to, what, redevelop some of the inner core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10164)|
| 2:49:30| then you might not press out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| You might press in or start in and press out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| I mean, you might refocus that same energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10174)|
| 2:49:37| But that's kind of the question he's wrestling with is what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| Is this a contained parcel, or is this the barn gates and the horses are off and running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10181)|
| 2:49:47| Yeah, and through the combination of the growth policy plan boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10187)|
| 2:49:51| and the existing large lot subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10191)|
| 2:49:55| it's virtually a contained piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10195)|
| 2:50:00| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10200)|
| 2:50:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10202)|
| 2:50:03| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10203)|
| 2:50:04| Yeah, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| I know Mr. Swanson, our general counsel, was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10206)|
| 2:50:10| Has he gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| He left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| Okay, because I was going to ask him to help us as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10214)|
| 2:50:18| direct our thoughts more specifically to what we're going to be deciding on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10218)|
| 2:50:24| And I appreciate everyone here, and I'm sure Bob and Todd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10224)|
| 2:50:30| and Mark Donaldson and MPC are all available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10230)|
| 2:50:34| and we have another 12 days until we meet at council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10234)|
| 2:50:39| and then if we decide to move forward on this, then we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10239)|
| 2:50:43| And I'm sure they would be happy to spend time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| and as I've gone out and driven around the property and looked and asked my questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10245)|
| 2:50:50| and, you know, I'll be doing more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10250)|
| 2:50:54| So, you know, and then at the council meeting we're going to have quite a bit of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10254)|
| 2:50:58| I mean, we'll have a time for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10258)|
| 2:51:00| And so I think that, you know, I'm interested in some of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10260)|
| 2:51:06| I have a lot of questions, and I'm going to go get those answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10266)|
| 2:51:10| between now and the course of the next 12 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10270)|
| 2:51:13| And I don't know how many people we have signed up, but I know it is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10273)|
| 2:51:17| I'm going to have to leave here in a minute, and I always hate to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10277)|
| 2:51:20| I never walk out on the public, but the community out there is most important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| and I was just wondering if, you know, we could go ahead and move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10284)|
| 2:51:31| I was going to – any other council questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| I've got a short one, and it's really to Joe and to you and maybe to everyone here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| and that is that, unfortunately, back in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| I planned with my brother to meet him for the week of the 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10301)|
| 2:51:46| and we get together once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10306)|
| 2:51:48| He lives in the Boston area, and I was hoping we could put this on the August –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10308)|
| 2:51:52| I mean, it's April – excuse me, the April 6th schedule rather than that 12 days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10312)|
| 2:52:00| So I was going to ask if that was agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| This does affect the 4th District in our area, and I do want to be personally involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10323)|
| 2:52:09| and I apologize for having tied up a date that I shouldn't have probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10329)|
| 2:52:13| I didn't know I was going to be a city council person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10333)|
| 2:52:16| I didn't know when the meetings were going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10336)|
| 2:52:18| We can discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10338)|
| 2:52:23| At the last meeting, we voted to postpone this, two nights ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10343)|
| 2:52:28| We voted on this postponement, and if there needed to be a longer postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10348)|
| 2:52:32| I think it needed to be discussed then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10352)|
| 2:52:34| I don't think that we can vote on postponements at workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10354)|
| 2:52:37| We can, but we can say – I mean, I would say just if the district representative can't be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10357)|
| 2:52:43| my tendency would be to say I would support a postponement, and, you know, other people can chime in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10363)|
| 2:52:50| It cannot happen until the time –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| You can withdraw a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10373)|
| 2:52:54| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10374)|
| 2:52:55| I was hoping Joe would have more time to do his investigation, so we all would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10375)|
| 2:53:01| Before we move to public forum, and I'll start with Mr. Wolfenbarger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| who has been wanting to say something for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10384)|
| 2:53:07| This is also a two-reading ordinance, so, you know, this will be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10387)|
| 2:53:12| If for some reason we don't go along with your postponement, we will consider it in April anyway, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10392)|
| 2:53:18| But I'm going to say, well, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10398)|
| 2:53:22| It could fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| So let me move towards public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10405)|
| 2:53:29| Before we start, Mr. Wolfenbarger has been asking to say something, and I'll start with public forum there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10409)|
| 2:53:33| We have, after Mr. Wolfenbarger, Virginia Douglas, then Susan Davis, then Grace Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10413)|
| 2:53:40| Then usually what we do with these is we sort of just let people come up to the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10420)|
| 2:53:43| and I'd like to ask folks to hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10423)|
| 2:53:46| By rule, you get up to five minutes, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10426)|
| 2:53:48| So, Mr. Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| I hope not to take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| My first question is just as a credibility issue, and I guess it's Mr. Elmore could answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10432)|
| 2:53:58| We were told that there are gas lines at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10438)|
| 2:54:00| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10440)|
| 2:54:03| There are lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| Let me cut in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10445)|
| 2:54:06| This is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10446)|
| 2:54:07| This is not question time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| So you can answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| Mr. Elmore can answer it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10449)|
| 2:54:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10451)|
| 2:54:12| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10452)|
| 2:54:13| My question is to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| I would like to know who, what, how, what's the plan to manage the two commercial tracks that are C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10455)|
| 2:54:26| Once you've created a business park at Midway Road, let's assume that this is something that passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10466)|
| 2:54:34| and you have a business park at Midway Road, and I own that track, and it's 73 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10474)|
| 2:54:41| and I want to put in a commercial center there with a couple of hotels and all the restaurants and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10481)|
| 2:54:49| And, of course, I have the means, and I approach KUB, and I say I need sewer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10489)|
| 2:54:55| And the next thing you know, Lisa, she's got the track across the street, and she wants to do something similar like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10495)|
| 2:55:02| How do you contain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| Is this something this council is prepared to change the zoning and restrict it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10504)|
| 2:55:09| or put conditions on it to keep it from developing to prevent the need for a sewer plant on the French Broad River?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10509)|
| 2:55:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10519)|
| 2:55:20| Our next speaker is Ms. Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| I'll invite again Susan Davis and then Grace Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10522)|
| 2:55:32| I'm Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10532)|
| 2:55:33| Thank you all for setting up this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| We actually need an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10537)|
| 2:55:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10538)|
| 2:55:39| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10539)|
| 2:55:40| And please give your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| 918 Ratt Street, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10542)|
| 2:55:47| Thank you for setting up this meeting so that we have had a long discussion on many points connected with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10547)|
| 2:55:53| I want to speak to one particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10553)|
| 2:55:57| I am against the Midway Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| It just promotes urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10560)|
| 2:56:04| No matter how you look at it, it's going to promote urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10564)|
| 2:56:10| I live inner city, and people have said of all the land that there's available, listed, not listed, available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10570)|
| 2:56:20| We do not have to go that far out from the center city to build this because it will bring up all these other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10580)|
| 2:56:32| You're not going to set up one business park and have nobody else out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10592)|
| 2:56:38| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10598)|
| 2:56:39| Look at the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| And I'm against it, and I think you as council should say, do I want urban sprawl on my conscience, or do we need to not do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10601)|
| 2:56:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| Susan Davis, please state your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10613)|
| 2:57:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| I'm Susan Davis, and I live at 9718 Cannon Lane, 37871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10622)|
| 2:57:08| And I appreciate you listening tonight, and I am one of those people who my great-grandpappy lived on the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10628)|
| 2:57:17| and I appreciate what you said about they're not making any more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10637)|
| 2:57:21| And my great-grandfather lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10641)|
| 2:57:25| My grandfather lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10645)|
| 2:57:26| My father lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10646)|
| 2:57:28| I live there now, and my son and my daughter-in-law live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10648)|
| 2:57:33| It's kind of like a little, you know, we're just there, and we're happy being in a rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10653)|
| 2:57:41| The barn, we call it the old barn because it's the barn that my great-grandfather built in the 1800s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10661)|
| 2:57:48| is right on the line of one of the pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10668)|
| 2:57:54| The new barn, we call it, was built pre-World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10674)|
| 2:58:00| Part of it was built when my dad was serving in the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10680)|
| 2:58:04| And we've worked real hard to maintain that lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10684)|
| 2:58:09| We raise horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10689)|
| 2:58:10| My daughter-in-law raises chickens, and I hope they raise my grandchildren there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10690)|
| 2:58:16| And I just thank you for listening because I think Elaine Clark said it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10696)|
| 2:58:22| Nobody's against growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10702)|
| 2:58:24| You know, we're all progressive people, and we're for progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10704)|
| 2:58:33| But when you have a wonderful opportunity with a beautiful piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10713)|
| 2:58:38| and you have all this other property that we have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10718)|
| 2:58:43| to take up that land to me is really just almost sinful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10723)|
| 2:58:49| And I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10729)|
| 2:58:52| Next person is Grace Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10732)|
| 2:58:54| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10734)|
| 2:58:55| State your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10735)|
| 2:59:02| My name is Grace Brooks, and I live at 1028 Cooper Road, Straw Plains, 37871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10742)|
| 2:59:10| My husband and I bought 33 1⁄2 acres on Cooper Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10750)|
| 2:59:17| We farmed all of our life, and we were tickled to death to own a small farm of our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10757)|
| 2:59:26| And we did just fine up until they started wanting to annex the neighbor's farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10766)|
| 2:59:32| So we all got busy, and we got that stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| Then this Midway thing come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10777)|
| 2:59:40| They told us industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10780)|
| 2:59:43| Well, it joins our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10783)|
| 2:59:46| And I guess we're lucky because we've got acreage in between our house and their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10786)|
| 2:59:53| We've got neighbors that walk across their backyard in the Midway, the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10793)|
| 3:00:01| Their fence is on the line, and they don't know what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10801)|
| 3:00:06| So we're asking that you leave our farmland alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10806)|
| 3:00:14| Because when we get through farming, my daughter and son-in-law is going to take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10814)|
| 3:00:20| And I don't think any of you people on this would want an industrial park in your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10820)|
| 3:00:30| And we've got several that's got it right in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10830)|
| 3:00:34| And we didn't know this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10834)|
| 3:00:36| The property, we didn't know the property was being bought until they approached me and wanted to buy our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10836)|
| 3:00:46| And I told them it wasn't for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10846)|
| 3:00:48| They came back the second time and upped the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10848)|
| 3:00:52| I said, it's still not for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| And the third time, he brought a paper saying, your husband said, first get the papers ready, you know, like we would sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10855)|
| 3:01:04| He turned it over for a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10864)|
| 3:01:05| I said, I'm not signing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| And so when my husband come home, I jumped him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10868)|
| 3:01:12| And he said, I didn't tell him that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| He said, I told him it wasn't for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10874)|
| 3:01:18| So I'm hoping that you all will spare our farmland because we want to continue to farm as long as we're able.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10878)|
| 3:01:34| But if we don't, we may go down, but we won't go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10894)|
| 3:01:41| We'll go down fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10901)|
| 3:01:45| We're not going to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10907)|
| 3:01:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| Are there other folks who would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10910)|
| 3:01:53| Come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10913)|
| 3:01:54| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10914)|
| 3:01:55| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| My name is Victor Jernigan, 108 Sequoia Lane, Suite 103, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10917)|
| 3:02:04| I wasn't going to speak, but I do want to address a couple of issues which have come up, which I do have some expertise in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10924)|
| 3:02:12| As a point of disclaimer, among the properties that I used to own was the 10 acres at the intersection of Midway Road and Thorn Grove Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10932)|
| 3:02:20| I acquired the property during the time that the Knox County Development Corporation was acquiring all the property that they were buying in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10940)|
| 3:02:30| Separately, and unrelated to that, I had the contract on the Graves Farm at Hardin Valley, which the Knox County Development Corporation purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10950)|
| 3:02:40| I had substantially more money on the property, as a matter of fact, than Knox County offered, which is now the Hardin Valley Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10960)|
| 3:02:46| And before that, I purchased the three-and-a-half acres on Hardin Valley that became the entrance into the technology park, which was relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10966)|
| 3:02:53| So I have a reasonable history of being involved in tracts of ground of size as growth is occurring in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10973)|
| 3:03:00| The reason that I'm saying this is that this 10 acres, if you look at any map, you can see that this is the entrance to where the business park will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10980)|
| 3:03:08| This is the center of the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10988)|
| 3:03:10| And while I had the property, I made an offer to buy the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10990)|
| 3:03:14| I tried several years ago to buy the property before Knox County, this 10-acre tract, because it is at a crucial intersection in all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=10994)|
| 3:03:22| The owner and I had had numerous conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11002)|
| 3:03:26| He lived out of state, about 500 miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11006)|
| 3:03:29| We put the property under contract, make an offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11009)|
| 3:03:34| He accepts the offer, says he wants to continue to think about the offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11014)|
| 3:03:37| He says, that's exactly what I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| And the reason I'm saying this is during this period of time that went on for several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11019)|
| 3:03:44| offers were continually being made to this gentleman for his farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11024)|
| 3:03:48| He got offers from Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| He got offers from people in Morristown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| He got offers from people in Johnson City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11032)|
| 3:03:54| They knew that Knox County was assembling land for a business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11034)|
| 3:03:58| I don't have a dog in the hunt anymore, but I can tell you clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| when they say that they have people that are looking to be in an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11041)|
| 3:04:07| the clients that Todd and Rhonda are working with are people that everybody wants to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11047)|
| 3:04:14| And it is an unbelievably competitive business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| These people were looking to buy land to stop Knox County from acquiring enough land so that they, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11057)|
| 3:04:24| this is my opinion and my opinion only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11064)|
| 3:04:27| but it's obvious that they were making offers to buy land at increasingly higher prices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11067)|
| 3:04:32| either to force the price up for Knox County to buy the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11072)|
| 3:04:36| or create some situation where Knox County wouldn't own the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11076)|
| 3:04:39| And you wind up with a situation that they are chasing clients to go into their business parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11079)|
| 3:04:45| or their opportunities, which are going to create jobs in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11085)|
| 3:04:50| And in a competitive environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| it's going to be that whoever winds up with the piece of property that these businesses want to locate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11092)|
| 3:04:58| These businesses that are looking at these locations have specific facilities that they want to build for a specific reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11098)|
| 3:05:07| And whatever that specific reason is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| they have availability of funding that allows them to pick and choose where they want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11109)|
| 3:05:15| They can say, we want to be here and these are the concessions we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11115)|
| 3:05:18| or we're going to go here and these are the concessions that they're going to give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11118)|
| 3:05:21| And they can deliver the buildings and the jobs and they have the money behind them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11121)|
| 3:05:25| So you wind up with a situation that Knox County is in a competitive environment for these types of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11125)|
| 3:05:31| I personally do not care what happens to the 400 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11131)|
| 3:05:34| When the land was being acquired by the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11134)|
| 3:05:38| there was a public meeting that was held out at Thorn Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| and I showed up at the community center and it took me 45 minutes to get the 200 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11141)|
| 3:05:46| that were crowded into the little building to understand that I wasn't with the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11146)|
| 3:05:51| What has happened is you have an owner of 400 acres that is going to do something with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11151)|
| 3:05:56| Knox County is going to sell it, become 1,600 houses, become a horse park, a NASCAR racetrack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11156)|
| 3:06:02| It can become a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11162)|
| 3:06:04| But as far as my little 10-acre track was concerned, I didn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| It's going to be developed because it's going to be sold and it's going to become something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11166)|
| 3:06:10| The issue of the sewer treatment plant and the sewer facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11170)|
| 3:06:15| the technology of packaged sewer plants is increasing at an increasing rate of the ability to treat waste on-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11175)|
| 3:06:24| If you go to any of, pick up any HomeBuilder magazine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11184)|
| 3:06:28| and you will see packaged facilities being sold to create entire subdivisions off the grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11188)|
| 3:06:34| So you wind up with a situation that the sewer facility and the type of facility that they can put on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11194)|
| 3:06:39| will easily be able to support any kind of business or industrial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11199)|
| 3:06:43| just as you could take the land never connected to a sewer system and put 1,500, 1,600 houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11203)|
| 3:06:49| The situation as far as jobs and sprawl are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11209)|
| 3:06:53| the issue is not what these 2,500 or 2,600 people are going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11213)|
| 3:06:57| but it's the potential 15,000 jobs that are being created five miles away at exit 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11217)|
| 3:07:07| You wind up with a situation that those jobs and those people, there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11227)|
| 3:07:12| Is that Sevierville or is that Strawberries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| Because it's the breadth of available housing for workforce housing in the Sevier County area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11236)|
| 3:07:23| So you wind up with a situation that this area and its proximity to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11243)|
| 3:07:28| create the greatest opportunity for workforce housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11248)|
| 3:07:31| which takes one acre, two acre, three acre pieces of ground with agricultural zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11251)|
| 3:07:39| whether it's in a planned growth area or a rural growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11259)|
| 3:07:43| and they come in and build the most affordable housing possible in the quickest possible time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11263)|
| 3:07:49| So the ability of jobs to create a competitive environment for property is what controls the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11269)|
| 3:07:59| The ability of, and this has not been mentioned, but it is, and I'll be finishing it right now, Mr. Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11279)|
| 3:08:06| is that this location of this facility, and people are talking about it creating sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11286)|
| 3:08:13| Again, you're seven miles from the largest retail area in the state of Tennessee at exit 407,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11293)|
| 3:08:18| but you are looking at a situation where you have thousands of jobs that are going to be well-paying jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11298)|
| 3:08:24| and this creates a growth opportunity for the East City area all the way out to Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11304)|
| 3:08:32| So you wind up with Park City, Park Ridge community out to Holston Hills being able to be the closest urban area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11312)|
| 3:08:44| similar to Forth and Gill, similar to Old North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11324)|
| 3:08:46| that has an opportunity to be rebuilt by the creation of jobs that are well-paying jobs, which has been pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11326)|
| 3:08:52| They don't want to drive across downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11332)|
| 3:08:55| They're going to want to live close to where their employment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11335)|
| 3:08:58| And this housing stock, which desperately needs to be rebuilt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11338)|
| 3:09:01| this will be a logical opportunity to create an employment base where people would want to move into these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11341)|
| 3:09:09| and begin to rebuild and re-market the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11349)|
| 3:09:13| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11357)|
| 3:09:18| Anything that needs to come before council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| If not, we will stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11363)|
| 3:09:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11368)|
| 3:09:58| This is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11398)|
| 3:10:00| This is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11400)|
| 3:10:02| Thank you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11402)|
| 3:10:12| Thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100311?start=11412)|
