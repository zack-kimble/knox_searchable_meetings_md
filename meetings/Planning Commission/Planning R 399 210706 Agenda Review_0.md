| 0:00:52| So this is the July agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| And we do have some commissioners that will not be present for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| So we'll start here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| We have some new faces on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| And these were recently appointed by Mayor Kincannon and approved by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| Logan Higgins and Marte Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| I'll ask Logan if you want to introduce yourself and say a few words and then we'll turn it over to Marte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:24| Hey, I'm Logan Higgins, and I'm excited to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| I run a design development company and retail and coffee shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=88)|
| 0:01:32| A couple different avenues of what we're doing and really excited to be part of this process and contribute to the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=92)|
| 0:01:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=106)|
| 0:01:54| I didn't realize I needed a mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| My name is Marte Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| I'm relatively new to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| I've been here about six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| I'm a mortgage loan officer for First Community Mortgage and have a background in MBA and social and sustainable entrepreneurship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=122)|
| 0:02:11| Very involved in the community with several boards and just looking to help with the development and growth of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=131)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| Anything we need to address before we start the review, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| I'm going to make a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| I hope everyone enjoyed their Fourth of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| Good to see you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| The first thing I'd like to do is introduce our newest team member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| We have Jean Stephens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| She is our planning services manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| This is her very first day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| So she started on a very busy day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| She has, I guess, close to over 25 years of planning experience in a variety of roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| So she's worked in the private sector most recently as well as in some government agencies, TDOT, as well as in Nashville for their MPO, which is our TPO equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:08| She is an East Tennessee native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| We're super excited to have her here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| So thank you, Jean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Chase Markram, who you all don't, none of you have probably actually met, but he is our GIS specialist, and he is going to be leaving our team in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=193)|
| 0:03:22| He's going to pursue a graduate degree abroad, and so he's part of our information services team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=202)|
| 0:03:29| He does touch the agendas that you all get every month with the mapping and the GIS, but we'll be looking to hire a new GIS specialist to replace Chase this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:41| The regional mobility plan that Jeff Welch had presented to you all some months ago has been adopted and is available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| I encourage you all to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| I believe I sent you all an email encouraging you to look at that final product when you have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| And then staff from our information services team is going to be providing support to redistricting committees for both the city and the county, both of which are currently underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=236)|
| 0:04:06| So we will be launching a website to share information within the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| Most of our support will be associated with just technical analysis and providing the information that is needed to these bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=251)|
| 0:04:20| We have a number of ordinance amendments that have been requested by the city and county that you will all be seeing over the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| The latest ones are the county has asked planning staff to assist in the development of food truck park ordinance, similar to one that the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| And then they've also asked us to look at consideration of churches in the shopping center zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| So that'll be one that I'll be bringing forward specifically for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| And there are several still pending for the city, one of which you'll hear today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| But there's there's a couple still on our work program to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| I just wanted to give you all a heads up that those are coming your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| I have any questions before we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| OK, so we'll start with mine first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| Like I mentioned, we have an ordinance amendment number thirty five seven eight twenty one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| You know, as we've said over the last few months, you know, actually since the new city code went into effect on January 1st, twenty twenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| And we will continue to make adjustments to the city code to address any oversights or inconsistencies that are identified as we move forward with implementation of that code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=319)|
| 0:05:28| And seven eight twenty one is one of those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| Staff is recommending amendment to article nine, section nine point two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| It's a use matrix table nine dash one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| It's in your packet or it should be on your you should be able to get to it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| And this is to allow consideration of preschool, kindergarten and educational facilities, primary or secondary as a special use and industrial mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:53| I am you district and we are specifically introducing this because we've had a lot of interest in using IMU zone properties for these uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=353)|
| 0:06:05| And given that they do allow some types of educational uses such as vocational and college uses, as well as residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=365)|
| 0:06:15| we do think that there are potentially suitable for preschool, kindergartens or primary or secondary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=375)|
| 0:06:21| And then allowing them to come in through the special use process allows us to evaluate each one on a case by case basis to make sure that the use is indeed compatible with the surrounding land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=381)|
| 0:06:33| You might have any questions about that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| OK, so we'll move on to agenda item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=399)|
| 0:06:46| This is Tim Howell. Michelle is the staff on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Item seven and eight are related and staff is recommending this request and she'll go over the staff recommendation with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=409)|
| 0:06:57| And so, as Amy said, this has two requests associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| So number seven is the top parcel that's highlighted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| And then the 1B series is all of these parcels that are grouped together down in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| And you can see they're located north of Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| This is the Marble City neighborhood, so it's kind of located at the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| The current land use properties are all vacant, but the neighborhood itself is predominantly single family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| There's a duplex and triplex here, but the rest of the properties are predominantly single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| They are looking to go from the traditional neighborhood residential land use designation to the high density residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=451)|
| 0:07:39| And they are looking to go from RN1 and RN2 to RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| And so I'm looking at the reason that we're recommending denial of the planned amendment request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| As you all know, there's four criteria that are associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| They would have to meet at least one and we do not believe they meet any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| So there's not an error in the plan that would warrant an amendment to the requested land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| There's not a change in the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| There's no change in public policy and no new information has become available regarding the need for a planned amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| Beyond that, we also don't feel that it meets the high density residential criteria described in the land use table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| So it's supposed to be located on major collector and arterial streets where all streets bordering the proposed developments are local roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| The development is at the rear of an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| It's supposed to be adjacent to your regional shopping and major office districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| And although there are commercial uses adjacent to this one on the map, this one is accessed from a different place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| It's along the interstate and this feels more as part of Marble City neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| Therefore, it's not truly adjacent as it's experienced on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| It's supposed to be relatively flat sites and the site does meet this criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| However, as you can see, there's a significant portion of this site that's in a floodway zone and in Pima floodway and floodplains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| It's also supposed to be along or near corridors served by transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| Transit stops are available along Sutherland, but not along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| And with the new zoning coordinates, there's opportunities for our N6 to be created along those major arterials and collectors where it would be more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=551)|
| 0:09:20| Reasons why we're recommending denial of the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| It does not meet all four criteria as required by the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| So there's no new change of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| There's no new utilities, no road changes, no infrastructure improvements, no new cat stops or routes, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:37| It's not consistent with the intent and purpose of the RN6 zone, which is intended to accommodate high density neighborhoods characterized by a mix of housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=577)|
| 0:09:46| And it may have adverse impacts on surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| So built out at its maximum density could have up to 201 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| As I mentioned previously, it's at the rear of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| The size and massing of the new structures to accommodate the density that they're looking for would be significantly larger than the massing of the houses here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| So it would be incompatible with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| And multifamily development is not part of this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| Again, there was just that duplex and triplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| It's not consistent with other plans as it doesn't meet the HDR land use class location criteria to be able to be amended to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=614)|
| 0:10:22| And I hope this has opened it up to any questions you guys might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| Michelle, what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| Yeah, I'm seeing it's backing up to an office and commercial and then you've got a RN6, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=631)|
| 0:10:39| Just to the west of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| If you're not recommending for the proposed zoning district, what would be next compatible that you would think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=643)|
| 0:10:52| So, yeah, thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| That was something else I meant to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| And though there is RN6 adjacent on the map, it feels very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| It's separated by a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| So the stream has a lot of vegetation around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| So it makes a physical barrier as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| You can see here in looking at the land use, the commercial and office hasn't been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| And then, again, that's a pretty significant barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| Looking at the eagle view of the property provides kind of a better view of the context of the layout of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| And then, again, you can see the single family neighborhood, whereas the apartments would be located right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| And so in looking at that, we met with the applicant's representative and told him, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| really the highest zone we could see going here would be RN2, just to be the most compatible with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=690)|
| 0:11:38| And, you know, these properties also have the right-of-way requests that have been postponed since September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=698)|
| 0:11:47| And those have been postponed to let the rezoning go through because if the applicant doesn't get this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| let's say eventually he sold the land, perhaps we could get someone in there that did want to develop it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| and use those alleys to put in buildings that were more consistent with the existing neighborhood, single family, duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:12:03| that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| The RN6 that's adjacent to it, that is accessed by Sutherland Avenue, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| It is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| And the staff report kind of goes into the densities that each one of those apartment complexes, because there's a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| There's this one, this one, and another one adjacent here, but they're all built out at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| I want to say it was around 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| The applicant has asked for 40 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| And so even though the city zoning doesn't really address density in terms of dwelling units per acre anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| that's the intensity at which they're wanting to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| And I know, I guess Gus's chicken is there, and they built in a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| Would they have to, is that considered a floodplain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Would they have to build it up higher if they do any kind of development along the stretch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| They do need to meet with engineering to kind of see what the city's engineering ordinance states about building in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| I couldn't speak to that specifically, but there are certain things that they would have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| I believe if they are able to fill in certain places or build higher, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| But that would all be engineering's purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| Okay, now we'll move on to number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| It's a plan amendment rezoning and a one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Van Smith Group, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Michelle will go over this one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| It's in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| So this one is in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| It is at the intersection of Kingwood Road and Balsam Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| North Broadway comes along through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Fountain Road through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Here's the infamous duck pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| And looking at the aerial, you can kind of see the context, a little bit of the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| So there's some clinics, multifamily, things of that nature along this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| And then single family, there's also some multifamily buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| small apartment buildings, fourplexes and duplexes in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| There is a significant sort of site constraints that are all in here that we'll go over in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| But in further looking at the context, you can see this parcel here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| and that's kind of what the lay of the land looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| So in looking at the existing land uses, single family predominantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| although there are some multifamily, again, duplexes, fourplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| and small apartment buildings within the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| The future land use map, the sector plan and the one-year plan both have this property as LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| though there is MDR in the area, and there would be adjacent to MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| Regarding the medium-density residential land use class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| it's supposed to be near community activity centers, including schools and colleges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| parks and community commercial office nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| There's a vet center here, church here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| and then there's plenty of those types of activities that it talked about along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| Or, I'm sorry, Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| And then, of course, major commercial along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| Traditional transitional areas between commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| and low-density residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| Again, there's a massive commercial development all along Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| So even though the significant slope kind of makes it feel separate to the properties immediately adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| it does provide a transition from Broadway into the neighborhood when you look at it in a broader scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| And looking at the zoning, you've got RN-5, RN-4, and then this property right here is RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| So there is a precedent for having RN-4 in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| Looking at the uses that are associated between the existing RN-2 and RN-4 zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| so RN-2 and RN-4 both allow single-family homes and duplexes by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| RN-4 also allows townhouses and smaller multifamily buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| and those have to meet the standards that are in 9.3.I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| And those address things like materials, transparency, and three-dimensional architecture features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| So it would have to come to review to meet those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| It's just a question of how many units as to whether or not staff would be the reviewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| or the planning commission would be the reviewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| And that cutoff is at eight townhouses for our review and planning commission review for townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| For multifamily, it's four and below by staff, five and over by planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| And I don't want to get into the standards, but just to show you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| there are several in here that address all those things I talked about earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| in trying to provide something that's a little bit more neighborhood-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| This is a little bit misleading because it's got a flat roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| but roofs aren't really addressed as part of that, so it could easily be a pitched roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| But as you can see, it does address things like transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| three-dimensionality, and architectural features, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| Another reason that we would support this is because of the missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| There's been a lot of talk about that recent months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| and so missing middle housing, just as a refresher, consists of duplexes, fourplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| townhouses, multiplexes, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| And in looking at the dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| the differences between the R&2 and R&4 zoning, those are all up here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| The main difference would be in the maximum building coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| so you're capped at 30% in R&2, 35% for single-family and duplexes in R&4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| but then you're allowed to go up to 50% for townhouses and multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| However, in this instance, because of the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| we believe this will be self-limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| Also, the setbacks are a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| I'm looking at that minimum front, 20 feet versus 10 feet, and that's the biggest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| And now to kind of look at the environmental constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| there's some pretty significant slope on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| For you guys that are really new, this darker area here is going to be the highest slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| That's over, I believe it's 40%, and then it goes down from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| to the pink, to the yellow, to the green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| And it's just a little bit of how that looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| So it kind of dips down into that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| but you do have some very flat land along Kingwood and Balsam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| Again, we feel like this will be self-limiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| into where the building will occur along those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| We did reach out to engineering to get their comments on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| regarding slope and building over streams and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| and engineering has said that they typically don't allow building over streams to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| they don't allow streams to be piped, culverted, and built over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| but there are avenues for the applicant to pursue with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| should they decide to go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| And then your staff reports go into more detail on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| It's fairly significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| They need special approvals from TDEC, from the director of engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| and things like that to be able to proceed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| There's a blue line stream on the property as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| and this kind of follows the path through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| but it does connect up this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| And so engineering would require a 30-foot buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| and you can see that a little bit better on the standard map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| So here's the stream here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Top of bank is going to be along either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| and they require an additional 30 feet from top of bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| which falls somewhere around in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| So by the time you put the depth of the properties along this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| it pretty much precludes building along Balsam Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Maybe they might be able to fit one unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| but again, we feel like the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| is mostly going to be self-limiting on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| Michelle, is the stream a wet weather conveyance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| or is it a full-time stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| So TDEC submitted an analysis a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| That's in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| They concluded that it was a stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| even though in the aerial view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| it kind of looks like it would be more of a wet weather conveyance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| Challenging piece of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| The first one is, and I'm sorry if I missed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| but if approved, would this come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| to review a concept plan, or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| It depends on the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| So if they decide that they wanted to build townhomes, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| if they built eight townhouses, it would come to review by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| So you guys would not see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| but it would still be held accountable to those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| If they built nine houses, same standards would apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| but you all approve it instead of planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| If it's multifamily, it would be four units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| where we would review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| and five would pick up where you guys start to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| And the second question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| in some of the comments that we've received from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| I'm going to try and articulate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| There was a statement made about the approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| or the recommendation to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| was based upon transportation opportunities that don't exist yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| Can you speak to that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Sure. So what you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| I think you're referring to the statement that was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| about the general plan, the basis as per the plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| and introduction of significant new roads or utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| that were not anticipated in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| to make development more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Because BRT, or accelerated, that's bus rapid transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| but Knoxville's calling theirs accelerated bus corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| that didn't really exist at the time of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| I feel like that would go under significant transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| which would, to me, kind of fit under that category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| but it's also an obvious and significant error commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| omission in the plan, changes in government policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| or trends in development, population, or traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| so I feel like it would definitely fall into that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| because it is a significant improvement in the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| Those type of bus facilities are designed to be more in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| with what you experience time-wise in your car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| and so if you can take that bus instead of your own car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| get there the same amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| and not put as many miles on your car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| it reduces vehicle emissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| all those things are kind of designed to be more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| you know, it kind of helps the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| but it also helps you, you can get other things done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| while you're riding the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| so we feel like that would encourage people to ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| increase ridership, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| It's a really significant investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| I feel like it's a major change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| so I feel like it does meet that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| I have a question, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| So with the RN4, they're only allowed to develop 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| of the property, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| So we're looking at around .75, .8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| is that eight townhomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Do you think that they could build those eight townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| and allow for parking on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| Yeah, they kind of sent us a rough concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| and I'm not sure if they would be able to fit quite eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| without doing some of that stream mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| type stuff we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| so it really depends on how much they're willing to invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| I feel like six or seven is probably more reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| for what they could fit, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| that's not a cap that we're putting on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| It just depends on how they're working with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| and what they can do in terms of mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| and whether or not they will be allowed to pipe over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| and build, because they would have to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| in order to mitigate that stream buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| to be able to come closer to the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| So it all kind of comes down to how much they're willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| to do any of those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| And so how many parking spaces would they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| for even if they did eight townhomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| So it's based on the number of bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| so it's just really going to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| to the floor plan of each individual unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| So I know that they have planned a garage for each unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| and they were looking at putting in private roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| that went behind the units to kind of lessen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| the amount of curb cuts that would be along the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| and then each one would have its own garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| So I think you're probably looking at 1.5 to 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| depending on, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| it's going to depend on the number of bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| So we really don't know without seeing an actual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| Is that in addition to the garage space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| That would be including the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| So they might end up having a parking pad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| for guest parking or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| Again, that's kind of getting into more of the concept phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| And does MDR, is that needed for eight townhomes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| They can't do that under low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| They would be allowed to do townhomes in R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| but not in R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| But under the low-density residential designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Sorry, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Okay, so to get R and 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| you would need medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| LDR only allows...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Let's see, let me go into there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| It's R and 1 and R and 2, and then E and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Yeah, so to answer your question, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| because they would still need MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| even if they wanted to do it in R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| And I think item number 13, is that yours, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| Yes, it is Parkgate Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| Yep, so this one's me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| This is also a city case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| This is Parkgate Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| It's kind of close to Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| I don't know if you can really see the peach on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| but this is all the Farragut area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| and then this is Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| So this is on Parkgate Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| It is south of Kingston Pike, near Canton Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| It is at the end of the Western Hills subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| which is this subdivision down here along Parkgate Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| And looking at the aerial map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| you can see that this parcel feels a little bit separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| from the commercial and office uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| even though on the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| it's showing general commercial along Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| and then office along this swath here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| This is probably due to the way that it was platted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| as the history of this property kind of came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| This was a road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| It has been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| Now it's part of the development along here, the strip mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| Canton Place is the name of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| So the properties to the west are all zoned OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| office, medical, and related services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| and this parcel is zoned planned commercial along with the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| So this PC that I have highlighted right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| where my cursor is, it's not a separate parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| It's part of this one along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| So they're looking to expand the OB onto this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| The same owner owns these all that are in a line as this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| So we're thinking they're going to combine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| and develop it under OB should this pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| So this one also is a little bit gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| in how we would look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| So on one hand, you've got OB adjacent to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| so it's a minor extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| It's supported by their sector plans, office designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| OB is generally less intense than PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| and then office uses typically provide a transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| down from commercial uses to single-family residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| However, in this case, because of the access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| that's the problematic part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| And so in looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| again, you're looking at the street network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| It looks like you kind of have to go through the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| to get to this parcel from a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| of different side streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| However, there is an access easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| that goes along this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| so you could travel through the strip mall parking area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| to get to this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| So there is access without using the neighborhood streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| and that's sort of the one concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| that we have with it is the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| This is the plat here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| It's kind of blurry on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| but it is a dashed line that delineates this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| so the access easement kind of comes along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| the boundary of the parcel to meet up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| and then the parcel that's being rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| is this one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| So in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| we just encourage the applicant, should this pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| to make sure that they're designing their access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| with all of that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| so that they're not pulling people through the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| to get to whatever it is that they plan to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| So that's the reasons that the zoning is approvable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| However, there's also some concerns with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| So the OB zone also allows multifamily residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| so they could feasibly put an apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| And again, because it is right across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| from single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| and if it is residential, the likelihood is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| that people would maybe try to get to it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| if they're not aware that you can come through this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| It just kind of opens up the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| for some awkwardness there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| So that's just something that we encourage the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| to kind of work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| as they're developing their site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| Michelle, you said encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Is there any way to require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| We can't condition rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Well, I know not condition rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| but in terms of plan approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| or a way to limit access only through Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| because that would be somewhat not really appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| to come through a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| I would say it really kind of comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| to what use it is they plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| So if it's something that's going to require a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| then through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| we could probably do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| But if it's something that's allowed by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| that just goes through for permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| then I think we would have more limited opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| to create something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| Amy, what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| I would assume that they're going to use Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| I would assume so as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| It's just a question of whether,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| there's already a sign at that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| so it's just a question of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| they would be able to add another sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| so that people would know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| hey, you can come through here to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| That sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Commissioner Smith, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Move on to number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| Number 16, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| This applicant is going to be requesting a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Is that correct, Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Do you want to provide a brief overview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| It will have to be voted on at the meeting to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| Yeah, so this one is another tricky one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| It's a long sliver of land along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| well, basically it resides along I-140 or Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| although there's frontage along Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| They're only requesting the highlighted portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| of the parcel to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| And so just looking at the context of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| these parcels haven't, some of them are in development now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| but not really developed fully yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| There's some single-family condos in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Looking at the sector plan map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| there is GC just to the north, little pocket of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| and then LDR around it with, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| there's a piece of it in the hillside ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| And then the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| you can see this is the city portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| and surrounded by county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| Looking at the zoning, it's CA is the county zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| general business, and then it's CH1 is this little strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| that kind of wraps around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| and they're wanting to extend that down further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| into this property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| Like one of the other ones we discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| there's some pretty significant topographical constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| although the closed contour lines that are on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| are likely a KGIS error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| or just outdated information as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| Since these images were input into KGIS several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| it's been culverted and built over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| and kind of filled in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| There was a TDEC determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Here's more information on the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| There is a sliver back here that is fairly steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| And then the TDEC determination on the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| So, again, it's got that same thing as the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| There's 30 feet required as a buffer area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| on either side of the top of the bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| and along the stream channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| So, really, they have to undergo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| some pretty significant mitigation measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| because by the time you factor in 30 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| on either side of this, 30 feet on either side of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| and then the HP along here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| this is largely undevelopable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| without doing some of those mitigation measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| so some of that would come down to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| And the reason that we're recommending denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| is just because there's a pretty solid line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| that goes across where that commercial is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| and we feel like that's just encroaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| that CH designation, which is the highest intensity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| of commercial designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| next to the lowest intensity of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| We just don't feel like that's compatible next to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| so we don't really feel very comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| extending that further into that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| But they are requesting postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| Okay, so can I ask a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| That parcel is, I guess it's owned by this applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| Dean Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Does he have access to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| or did he own the other two parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| that are on either side of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Let me see which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| It looks like LaConte Holdings has two on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| and he has the one in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| and I just didn't know if this property has access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| It kind of comes through that little pinch point part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| Let's see if I can pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=1999)|
| 0:33:33| I guess if it's being postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| it really doesn't matter for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| So he would have to have his access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| somewhere along through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| probably as far away from Pell City Parkway as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| along through here would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| But that's how it would be accessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| He'd have to come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| It looks really narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| but these pinch points are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| just due to the size of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| I think it's 120 feet through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| So it's actually bigger than it looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| Well, it's in a different entity name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| The owner of the piece in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| is a different ownership name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| than the two on either side that go to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Maybe it's the same guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Who owns it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| It looks like it's all LaConte Holdings LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| for the whole piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| I remember when we rezoned this a couple of years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| We're going to switch over to Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2076)|
| 0:34:47| The next one's item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| It's a rezoning and plan amendment for Carla Goins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| You guys heard this applicant's request at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| It was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| It's on Shod Road or on the Shod Road extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| just west of Hitching Post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2101)|
| 0:35:12| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| So this is the south side of Ball Camp Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| the future Shod Road extension west of Hitching Post Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| You can see the extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| along through the central part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| Hang on just a second right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| Through this area, this is the Shod Road extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| This property was reduced in size to 0.86 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| when they were coming through to acquire right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| It's adjacent to the Ball Camp Park and Aso Soccer Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| The applicant is requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| to go to neighborhood commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| and they also need a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| This is what the zoning looks like currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| It's part of an older planned residential zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Again, they're just asking for this small portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| on the front here to go to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| We can see nearby about a half mile away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| on either end of Ball Camp Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| that there are neighborhood commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| and this is a relatively, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| half-mile area between the two of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| So it meets the location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| It's also within a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| hopefully more walkable area in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| as Shod Road is extended through here with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| Ideally, you know, the walkability will increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| between the adjacent residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| in this area and the park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| This is what the existing land use looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| You can, again, see that it's adjacent to the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| and then some of these larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| single-family residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| This is in the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| and again, major infrastructures inspected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| are expected through here soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| This is what the Shod Road project looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| So this is part of phase two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| I think this was gone over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| during one of the last meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| I won't go through the video of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| We've seen it a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| but it will essentially be four 12-foot traveling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| separated by a 30-foot raised median,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| four-foot bike lanes on the outside shoulders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| curb and gutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| Let's see, major intersection improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| and five-foot sidewalks on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| We have spoke with County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| since the last time we discussed this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| There was initially some thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| that they would perhaps be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| to access hitching post at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| It seems like that is gonna be not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| However, County Engineering has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| that there will be access provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| as part of this improvement project here for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| but it will be limited access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Again, this is the description of neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| So it's generally located along arterial streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| and the new neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| should not be zoned or developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| within a half mile of existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| And we're at about a half mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| at this location currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| And the size of this will be quite limiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| since it's less than an acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| The use on review that's coming through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| this month as well for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| they want to do a food truck park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| We do feel that the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| of the CN Zone District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| the other uses that would be permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| would have to come back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| If they were more intensive uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| this body would get a chance to see it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| But the food truck park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| we think will be pretty small in size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| and not very impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| And there are also landscaping requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| in the CN District that should hopefully help buffer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:35| Liz, for the truck areas like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| what's required in terms of improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| Would all the surface areas need to be paved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| You mentioned landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Yeah, so for the CN Zone District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| it requires a 20-foot landscape buffer to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| And the applicant, I think in their use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| is proposing a 40-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| But the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| can require a larger landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| So yeah, sorry, they will be slightly limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Let me reduce the size of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| You're asking for the impervious surface area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| of the CN District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| Yeah, so there's minimum lot area of 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| Parking areas will require landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2445)|
| 0:40:54| I don't see a site coverage limitation currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| I think our understanding is they're going to be using gravel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| for their parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| That was my question. Is that permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| It's per Knox County, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| What about the entrance, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| Would the entrance need to be paved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| Or can it be gravel, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2476)|
| 0:41:28| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| We will require that their required ADA parking be paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| Our understanding is you can't make gravel ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| So we will require that they have at least some paved surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| Some of the lot will still potentially be paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| If it gets above 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| they'll have to also provide a stormwater management plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| So I'm assuming they'd want to keep that below that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| Oh, the access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Yes, we're restricting less out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| That was our main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| We're going to be rebuilding all the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| and the curb and gutter through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| I have committed to Mr. and Mrs. Goins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| that the county would construct that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| so that it does meet our standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| and it complies with what we would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| rather than them constructing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| So I know that there was a food truck park in Powell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| that had a whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| and there's not really a food truck ordinance for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| I know that's being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Where would this fall as far as requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| Because I can't imagine that ordinance would be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| Yeah, Amy and I, we've tried to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| We feel like we can, in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| get this and the lady in Powell squared away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| She was trying to occupy a permanent structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| and the code had some issues with the permanent restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| So we have since worked with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| to provide portable ADA compliant restrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| and so we're going to allow that to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Much like in this case, we'll also require that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| until such time we have a permanent ordinance later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| Any other questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| Potentially. It's actually for the connected case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| the use on review, but can I ask that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| It's regarding the noise standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| and you sent me, thank you, the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| but I'm trying to digest it quickly now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| and don't have the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| Can you or anyone speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| and the reason I'm asking this is because of the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| that came up at our last session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| where there was a food truck park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| and one individual was complaining about the noise level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| because of amplified music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| I'm wondering what will be allowed at this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Would amplified music be allowed or would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| It would need to comply with this section here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| And I believe I sent you this earlier today too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| so you probably haven't had a chance to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| I have it pulled up on the screen if you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| It's under the supplemental regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| applying to a specific or several or all zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| Article four, it's performance standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| for commercial and industrial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| and they're specifically a noise section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| So there are certain decibels and frequencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| that they can't exceed when it's a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| So is it possible for me to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| to distill that into your vast knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| of these sorts of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Would with those decibels restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| would amplified music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| since this is a commercial option be allowed or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| I think they're allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| but they wouldn't be able to exceed the decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| And as far as I know in the hours of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| with the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| I think there's some limit about when they could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| from what hour to what hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| that they could have any sort of amplification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| Sorry, I'm pulling up the case file for the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2722)|
| 0:45:30| Mike Reynolds is out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| I don't know that it talks specifically about that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| I'm raising that question now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| but also for potential future cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| just that our body think about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| because I think food trucks parks are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| And when I've been to some that are in the city center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| when they are using a sound system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| that's just like Spotify playlist, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| But when it's amplified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| it is like you can hear it like two miles away really loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| And when the opposition spoke last month about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| that would seem to be his primary complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| was just the volume of noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| And so I think that's something just for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| to be cognizant of as we're looking at more of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| And it can be something that's addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| as part of the use on review of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| So if the commission wished to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| under the review criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| the use is compatible with the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| where it is proposed and the size and location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| of the buildings in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| I mean, you could address this through the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| that you see under the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| hours of amplified music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| I have a question then with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| does the city food truck ordinance talk about noise in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| And if it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| would that be kind of adopted in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| food truck ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| I don't know off the top of my head commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| but that's something that we can look into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| and something that we should evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| as part of this for sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2836)|
| 0:47:24| Item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| This is the Dominion group, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| This is off of Alcoa Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| near the new roundabout with Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| The applicant is asking to go from office and RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| which is the city's low density residential zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| to RN5, which is a general residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| And they are asking to go on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| from office to medium density residential office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Again, you can see the new improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| with the roundabouts here at Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| This is what the area zoning looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| So it's RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| It's adjacent to the county's RA zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| These zone districts allow a 35 foot height limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| So the RN5 also has a 35 foot height limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| The area shows up currently as office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| and there is a small office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| that exists currently on a portion of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| adjacent to Dresser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| This is what the one year plan looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| You can see that this is also showing up as office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| And again, this needs a one year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| to medium density residential office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| This is what the surrounding land uses look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| A lot of single family residential adjacent here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| But again, this is a major intersection interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| for Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| This is what the property looks like currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| It's relatively flat in comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| to a lot of areas around Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| This is the location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| for medium density residential and office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| So it's really a transitional land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| between commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| or highway commercial corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| to low density residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| And again, relatively flat sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| So it's possible that this area could be served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| by transit at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| And just as a point of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| we noted this in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Since we are going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| the Alcoa Highway corridor planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| we've been pulling data for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| So the area you see highlighted here in green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| are two census tracks around Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| And the little blue dot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| is where the proposed project is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| So when we look at area under this table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| this is those two census tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| So from 2000 to 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| there was about a 2000 person drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| in population in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| So that's actually a negative 17% population growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| Whereas the county overall grew by over 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| in that same time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| So there has been some major population loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| in this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| And this shows our development activity dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| This is all building permits for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Again, you can see that there are very few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| residential building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| that show up as yellow and orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| Orange is multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| There are little to none that have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| in the Alcoa Highway corridor in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| And this is what that mix looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| for the entire South County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| So this is from our development activity report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| The area that I'm moving my sort of mouse around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| is the South County sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| So it includes the Alcoa Highway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| And you can see there have been very few multifamily uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| permitted in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| Staff is recommending approval of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| in an effort to help increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| some of the residential density, hopefully, in this corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| which ideally would spur some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| economic development growth out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| for commercial and other non-residential land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| in this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| Are there any questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| First off, I want to let you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| there was a neighborhood meeting two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| and I attended the neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| The only thing is I was 15 minutes late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| and I missed the developer's presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| He was just saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| are there any questions when I walked in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| So I heard the people basically that were opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| but I didn't hear his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| And I didn't learn anything new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| and I don't have any idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| Although I live real close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| I don't have any financial interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| No one in my family does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| We're just residents of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| With that, Liz, where is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| I'm drawing a blank here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| The access road that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| So here is Dresser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| It's my understanding, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| that they'll have access along Maloney Road for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| So there currently is an improved access at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| that seems to have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| when they were putting in the roundabout improvement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| Because it's going to potentially be a larger development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| I think they may be required to have two access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| Again, this will come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| with the city's engineering department for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| But actually, that just goes down to Alcoa Highway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| And then it goes north past Ginn Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| and then it becomes a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| There's a division there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| a real access to the large area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| that is basically vacant now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| Am I reading that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Yes, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3288)|
| 0:54:57| Any other questions for Liz on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| Okay, so the next one we're going to cover is 3SB21C, Innsbrook Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| And Mike, like I mentioned, is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| He's traveling back to Knoxville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| So Liz is going to help me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| by sharing some of the case file with you as I go over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| So as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| there's been significant public comments on this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| over the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| It has been postponed a number of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| and a community meeting was held recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| and the community is requesting another postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| to try and engage with the developer and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| as well as potentially engage their own traffic engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| So given the significant interest in this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| I plan on giving you all a high-level overview of the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| and staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| but encourage that the bulk of the discussion happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| at the Thursday meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| just given the significant interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| in this particular application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| Just Liz is pulling up the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| So the property is located on the north side of Ruggles Ferry Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| hike west and north of Lake Lane, east of Graves Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| It is located in the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| and it is a very large piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| It's 201 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| The area is predominantly developed with single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| and rural residential uses in the ag and RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| which is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| There's lots of large lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| what we call estate lots located out in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| The review before you is a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| per the subdivision requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| and the purpose of the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| is to provide enough information for staff and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| to provide enough information to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| the practicality, suitability, and conformance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| with all adopted plans and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| of the proposed plan before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| As part of the concept plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| the planning commission can require modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| to the subdivision plan or other improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| that are in keeping with the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| in the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| or any other adopted ordinances or plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| This can be found in Article 2.07 of the subregs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| We as staff have been asking about the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| and what I would encourage you all to ask as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| as you're considering the review of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| Is the proposed subdivision consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| with adopted plans or plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Does the development comply with zoning ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Does it meet dimensional standards in the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Is the use permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Does it provide safe ingress and egress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Is the infrastructure or proposed infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| adequate to support the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Are the lots buildable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Are there unique characteristics of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| such as topography or sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| that might require additional consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| Are our conditions based on the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| that are clearly identified in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| or the adopted plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| The sector plan designation for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| is low density, residential, LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| This type of land use is primarily residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| in character at densities of less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| five dwellings per acre in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| Land with the LDR designation is intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| to be served by water and sewer utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| and by collector roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Slope should be less than 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| The recommended zones include the PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| A, RB, and RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3507)|

| 0:58:31| Ruggles Ferry Pike is a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| The property does not have significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| slope constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| The zoning is, the property is RA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| and has been RA since January 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Again, RA zoning is for residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| with low population densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| And the RA has specific dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| that guide the placement of the houses on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| A lot sizes, building heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| these cannot be varied by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| This is different than what you all typically see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| what we see more frequently is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| large lot subdivisions in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| or large subdivisions in the PR plan residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| So there are certain front yard setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| Rear yard minimum lot size is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| Minimum lot width is 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3554)|

| 0:59:21| The applicable sector plan is the East County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| and it does call for low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3565)|

| 0:59:29| and does include recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| as part of the plan for a community park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| in the general vicinity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| which can be found on page 45 of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| It's just west of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| Other relevant plans that come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| are the Knoxville-Knox County Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| Recreation and Greenways Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| It also recognizes that park that I just referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| which is what's called a community park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| as part of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| Again, that can be found on page 48 and 76| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| of the Recreation and Greenways Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| The East County Community Plan is a more recent plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| that has been completed for this part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| And this plan was a result of a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| that came out of the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| after the rezoning and sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| to allow Midway Business Park to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| I don't know if some of you may recall that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| It was quite controversial at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| So as that moved forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| there was a request for planning to develop a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| to protect the character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| And so this plan recognizes the limits on tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| that we have in our toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| to adequately address preservation of rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| It does make specific recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| on tools and processes to pursue in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| And this will be a great tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| This plan and these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| that are in the East County Community Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| for our upcoming land use and transportation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| that you all are very aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| that we'll be embarking upon this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| So you can find some relevant sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| that speak to this on page 33 and 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| And the East County Community Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| really did focus on more of the French Broad Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| But again, it does talk more broadly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| about this part of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| and the community's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| in preserving rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| So the overview of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| The applicant did make several modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| to their proposed concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| that was submitted in March just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| They created common area lots between 112 and 133.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| I don't think you're gonna be able to see it on this screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| It's a pretty large plan and the screens are small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| They're super small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| So hopefully you can see it on your screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| and can zoom in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| But it's about 2.35 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| and it's intended for community access to the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| You know, preliminary review of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| shows that the slope on this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| adjacent to the river is very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| And accessing the water from this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| would be quite challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| You know, there have been discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| about a transfer of land to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| to manage as part of their park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| And I think the county has noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| that this particular piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| would not be one that they would necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| be interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Not that they would be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| in any other portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| but this one, getting access to the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| for the community would be quite cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| They created a larger centralized amenity center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| which consists of a clubhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| fitness center with a pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| They did create some additional pocket parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| and an area for a possible playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| And they created, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| some additional pocket parks for a dog park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| which is near lot 184.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| And those other pocket parks are lots 395 and 396.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| They have several mail kiosks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| located in three separate common areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| which is a change from their first concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| And so in total, the development includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| 11 separate lots of common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| for a total of 11 and a half acres of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| and 5.3 miles of roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| The total lot count was reduced by seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| from 482 to 475.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| And if built out at the proposed density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| the development would be 2.36 homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| The staff is recommending approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| subject to a number of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| There's 17 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| I'm not gonna review all 17 of them today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| but they are in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| and I'll hit on several that may be of the most interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| Number 13 is sidewalks will be installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| per Knox County sidewalk ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| in consultation with Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| And number 15 is the developer should provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| either the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| And Liz, I don't know if you can pull this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| It's the, yeah, that one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| So the developer should provide either the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Around the external boundary of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| and you can see this in exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| that's on the screen and in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| It's the red, I'll be referencing those red lines there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| That around the external boundary of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| when adjacent to the platted subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| are parcels currently used for residential purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| A, maintain all trees with a minimum four-inch diameter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| within 10 feet of the external boundary of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| and all trees shall be clearly marked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| and protected to identify limits of disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| Selected removal of trees will be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| if they're dead or dying or invasive species.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| And the tree's diameter will be measured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| from about four, four and a half feet above the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Or B, all lots within 100 feet of the external boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| of the development referenced above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| shall have an average lot size of one acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| with no lot being less than 30,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| And this is to get at that question of compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| given some of these large estate lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| that are on either side of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| Number 16, it was provide a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| of one and a half acres of publicly accessible land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| for open space with direct access to the Holston River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| In consultation with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| per section 3.12 of the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| any donation of land to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| is subject to final review by Engineering Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| or the Knox County Parks Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| Again, that would be contingent on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| and they would have the right to reject any proposed donation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| if it could not be utilized by them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| and managed in a cost-effective manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| As part of their park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| And so if an agreement for publicly accessible land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| cannot be reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| staff recommends providing an accessible access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| to the Holston River for the residents of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| We think it's a great asset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| and that is part of our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| And then finally, the revised concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| shall be reviewed and approved by Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| prior to the issues of any grading permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| What questions can I attempt to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Question on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Are those external sidewalks or internal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| Some external?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| Jim, if you want to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| They will be required to provide some internal sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| Yes, Pat, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| I think their frontage along the Ruggles Ferry is very minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| so they won't necessarily be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| But what the ordinance says is any subdivision street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| that has more than 1,000 daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| So what we were kind of thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| was all those streets up to the pool area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| to where the folks, if you live down closer to Ruggles Ferry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| you can walk safely to that pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| And then once you get back further into the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| the need and the traffic volumes are less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| So it will primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| sidewalks will be focused on those main routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| in and out from the pool down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| Yeah, I had two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| The traffic study that was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| did it assume the full build-out of 482 lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| Yes, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| I don't think it was adjusted, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| So in other words, the developer will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| are they having to do any road improvements for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| Yes, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| And there was, let's see, here, let me find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| They will have to, and then there's also been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| let me see if I highlighted it in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| And are they done like up front or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| That has not been decided at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| There has been, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| turd signals that were discussed between Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| and the city of Knoxville had decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| that they would be requesting a road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| The city of Knoxville had decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| that they would be requesting a traffic signal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| but Knox County didn't think that it was necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| on their control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| I mean, 482 lots, I don't even, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| I'm assuming they're gonna give us some kind of phasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| I mean, that's a 10-year deal at best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| and we are in a great market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| It's not gonna be great for 10 years, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| but that's a long, that's a lot to put on at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| I can't imagine that they wouldn't be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| more than like maybe 100 at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| When we talked to them a couple weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| I had asked them to share with us a phased plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| We have not received that, but that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| I thought it would be helpful for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| to be able to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| And also, in a phased plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| are the amenities included on the front phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| Or, you know, I couldn't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| Are they planning on building the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| because I've seen things happen before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| where the amenities are shown in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| but they don't get done on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| Sometimes that creates problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Yeah, I think that's gonna be a very good question for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| especially since we haven't received the phased plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| And if you would rather me ask this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| at the session on Thursday, just let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4140)|
| 1:09:01| The comments that came from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| seem to largely focus on the size of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| And I just wondered, can someone provide a context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| for this size of development versus the others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| that we see and have seen throughout the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| Is this one so substantially larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| or where does it fall in that kind of length?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| In my opinion, it's substantially larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| The density is relatively average, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| but it is, it's just, if it was 10 acres at the same density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| we're not even probably having a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| But when you put 480 lots on the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| everybody notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| I mean, it stood out to me, but I wanted to check myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| that I was having, that I too was looking at it as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| wow, this is a significant development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| and you would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| Was it 2.3 units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| I think it was the density, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| 2.36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Yeah, I can't remember the last time we saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| a property of this size come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| You all, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Post oak, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Post oak, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| But, you know, I do want to give accolades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| to both staff and Mr. Snow's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| for working well with the developer on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| and getting some concessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| It seems like there's been some improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| in the initial presentation, or initial application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| One other question, just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| You were pointing out on number 17 of the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| or that we would review the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| so this, assuming this is moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| we would see this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| It would come before staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Staff again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| But if there was any other, if there were significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| like say, for instance, if this were to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| and you all were to approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| without any additional conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| it was just these, or if you were to add conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| it would need to come back to Planning Commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| for review to make sure that all the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| were addressed on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| If it was not, and if they were going to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| significant deviations, it would get kicked back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| to you all for an additional review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| I have a question about the common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| Are retention and detention ponds considered common areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| There are a number of them that are identified on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| as common area, but we wouldn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| consider them as active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| That's on just about everything that comes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| because they want us to think, oh boy, there's common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| That's nothing but a pond to collect water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| during a rainstorm, stays muddy when it's not raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| I think they ought to be designated, not just on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| but from here on, not as common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| but as a retention or a detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| because that's what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| Has anyone talked to Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| or especially the elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| I know it said that the estimated school yield was 160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| I always feel like those seem like they're on the low side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| but this could potentially create a lot more students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| for especially the lower schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| We have not spoken directly with Knox County Schools about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| I'm not sure if the developer has either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| I think we've got to keep in mind what Scott Smith mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| This is a multi-year phased project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| I can't imagine a developer going out and building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| that many lots at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| It doesn't seem very practical in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| I'm not saying he couldn't, but in normal cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| they don't build that many lots in the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| It's normally phased in, and like Scott said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| they might do 50 or 100 at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| It'll be interesting to see what their phased approach is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| I think that would be a reasonable place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| If it was rezoning, then we would have Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| do a calculation on anticipated additional kids in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| but since it's going just under an RA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| it's kind of a limited review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| That's probably why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Don't they normally calculate impacts on schools on rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| We have a calculation that's part of our analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| But you don't do that on this, on a concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| Well, it does include the estimated student yield on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| There's a lot of information in this packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| And then we do provide that to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| It is information that we do end up providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| We just don't necessarily send them every application that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| It's a great opportunity, I think, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| but we need to have a closer relationship with them as the county continues to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| I really appreciate the question that Commissioner Smith raised about at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| what point do the amenities get put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| And I'm just asking this to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| not knowing what their answer to that question might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| but what we can do in terms of adding to the list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| requirements that they go in at a certain time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| I think you can request a phasing plan and for review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4489)|
| 1:14:55| And as part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| identify exactly when the amenities are going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| If we're going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| how could we vote on this on Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| If we don't have a phasing plan, which you don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| and they have not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| if you're required that maybe they have to be in by when you do Phase 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| or Phase 3 or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| that's all undecided now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| It would seem to me that that should be on the front end when you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| at it, that, all right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| by the time they get through Phase 2 and they're going to start Phase 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| they need to provide the amenities or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4546)|
| 1:15:55| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Commissioner, that's something you can bring up at the meeting on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| Yeah, but then we'd be looking at another postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Well, now on the road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| it would be up to Knox County to decide when those are going to be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| to be done or bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| So that's not really that's, that's, that's the county's end of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| We don't, but with regard to phasing, if we approve this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| it's submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| Does that mean they could build, they could start and do 20 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| Or are they obligated to do the entire concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| I mean, when they're approved, they're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| And they have the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| they have the right to do as much or as little as they want once they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| This is for like the first questions for, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| developers on the commission, as far as amenity phasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| do you think it's feasible to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| to require like amenities being installed by 50% of filled out rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| say phase one or two or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| because they could phase it in such a way where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| phase two is like 300 homes and they don't have to put in amenities until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| like the very end of, you know, over say 10 years, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| is that even a feasible request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| Just starting to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Not that we would require it on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| I've done pools and clubhouses on the front end because it helps me sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| because then, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| You know, some people have bought, I've run into in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| they bought before and they were promised amenities that they never got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| Well, we got that as a case months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| So we, we try to put them in on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| but I think with this development, I'm just curious if, if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| what he has in mind, I'm not saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| I'm not saying that this guy would, this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| this development would do that or not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| I'm just curious about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| My other question looking at condition 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| it's kind of like a or B I guess part B of the condition saying that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| external boundary lots would be an average lot size of an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| Are they currently that big or would they have to basically alter their plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| They would have to alter their, they'd have to alter their plan. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| There might, I'm sorry, there might be some on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| on the east side that are are an acre or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| but most of them are, are, are under that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| And then the portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| if you could leave that plan up of trees that are closest to the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4715)|
| 1:18:41| are there any conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| I don't really see any talking about preserving some of those trees on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| more sloped area since it wouldn't necessarily be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4726)|
| 1:18:54| Well, could we include something about preserving those trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| He was looking at those lots. They're really large, I think for a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| so that they kind of stay, but you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| there are disturbance limitations adjacent to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| okay, the river there. I don't think, I don't see it in any specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4751)|
| 1:19:19| condition that is that we have listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| So that would be more covered by land disturbance than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| They couldn't really disturb that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| There's a 50 foot non-disturbance buffer. I think this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| probably required by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| Sorry, there's a 50 foot disturbance buffer shown on the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| adjacent to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| Okay. And then my last question has to do with the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| There was one common area lot that was like access to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| I know that Jim was talking about maybe having more sidewalks at lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| prior to getting to the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| Would that reach that area that people would have sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| Not obviously down to the river, but like to that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| Is that how far the sidewalks would be reaching?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| I didn't catch that on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| I'm not sure that sidewalks would be required on that particular road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| That would be a question for Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| Knox County would need to evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| That's further back. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| I couldn't find that overall plan to see where that lot was in relation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| Yeah, it's over here on the east side here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Or you can't see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| Yeah, that's like pretty far back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| So I think I heard someone say that the lot that they were planning on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| giving access to the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| the county is currently determining whether or not they would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| take that or did they already determine that they didn't want to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| I don't know that they've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| they've gotten to that point where having conversations, I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| And Mr. Snowden, please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| but I don't believe that the developers had specific conversations with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| county at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| It was just identified as one that would provide access to the river there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| Question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Would it be possible, this may be Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| to get the engineer to show, highlight what roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| And I assume they're in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| Yes, I'll have to confirm that those conversations have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| have taken place in terms of the requirement for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| the way it's written now is just per Knox County sidewalk ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| but I'll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| I'll confirm with Knox County engineering and the developer that they've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| they have indeed had those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| They've identified which roads will have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| I just wanted to think, and it's a compliment to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| And I think it's Allie Ketron that developed the system for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| comments and the way those are cataloged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| It was incredibly helpful when I was looking at this case because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| way that they were visible in the system that was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| So just thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| I know it took a while to get used to, but it worked really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| Thank you. Yeah, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Yeah, it was a team effort on, on their end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| So they'll appreciate hearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| We have one more to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| It's Levin's case of one switch here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| And this is seven, a 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4942)|

| 1:22:29| The UCI has a number of facilities that will support its dog training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| So they will be required to provide a training facility at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| And as a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| you will be required to operate a clinic program on your dog training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| facility at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4958)|

| 1:22:41| The dog training facility will be used by a group of practice in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| to theLevin program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| We have one more to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| It's Levin's case of one switch here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4966)|

| 1:23:07| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| My name is Levin, so I just wanted to say hello to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| This is my first presentation at one of these meetings, so I just wanted to say hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| So this is for 7A21-UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5002)|
| 1:23:29| The applicant is requesting the USAN Revu to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| for a dog training facility at 5307 East Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5012)|
| 1:23:40| The subject property is zoned A, agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| and the surrounding zonings include RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| low-density residential, and PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| The sector plan map here shows that the property is located in the North County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| and as a sector plan, land use classification is LDR, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5042)|
| 1:24:10| I included an aerial photo here, just giving a bit more understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| of what this property looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| I'll show you here on the site plan, the dog training area is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5057)|
| 1:24:26| to be located back in the rear of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| I'm just going to go into what the proposal really is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5069)|
| 1:24:35| The applicant is proposing to have one dog trained per session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| Dog owners will be on the property present with the dog at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| Dog training hours will be Monday through Thursday from 12 till 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| 8 p.m. and Friday from 12 till 5 p.m. There won't be training on weekends at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| It's really just going to be during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| The business is supposed to be located, the business component of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| that the applicant has discussed is located in the existing garage here, which is right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5106)|
| 1:25:13| not in the home, so I just wanted to clarify that, that by no means is this going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| to be a home-based operation, any type of involvement with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| will be in that garage that already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| So I'm just going to discuss a little bit more about the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| The red area, that's going to be a six-foot tall chain link fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| where the dog would be located for training purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| Located on the east side is a six-foot tall privacy fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| and the applicant has already completed a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| My understanding is it's not exactly for training, but he has built a fence here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| the black line, and then has also expanded the driveway over here too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| possibly for some parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| So this use on review is slightly unique in that dog training is not a defined use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5163)|
| 1:26:15| in the ordinance, kennels are a permitted use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| With discussion with Knox County, Knox County staff has determined that dog training is similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5180)|
| 1:26:28| to kennels, and therefore can be considered a use on review in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| Ultimately, staff has come to the understanding that this is a challenging location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5193)|
| 1:26:41| and we are recommending denial of the request of the dog training facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5201)|
| 1:26:48| The proposed use is inconsistent with the North County Sector Plan land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| of low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| The intent of low-density residential is to support residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| and this one falls under a little bit more of a commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| and does not really support residential in its character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| I've included the map here, and it really kind of goes into a bit more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| of what currently exists on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| I guess I probably should have just zoomed in a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| But it is single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| This is certainly a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| So, yeah, that's the extent of my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| So, this is not a kennel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Dogs are not going to be boarded there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| Sorry, could you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| No dogs boarded on the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| No, that's not the plan, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| It seems kind of harsh with one dog, and the owner's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| and they're not going to allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| I don't see what the big deal is, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| I think this one's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| If the Zeleny's classification was agriculture, I think it would be much easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5281)|
| 1:28:06| because you can have commercial uses in the Act District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| It's just that with it being LDR, it makes it a little more challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5289)|
| 1:28:14| Has it been LDR a long time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| And they've been operating out of here as well, and so they came in after a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5301)|
| 1:28:29| Was there a complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| There was a complaint, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| Does he live in the house that's on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| Is it like a home business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Yes, but it can't be considered a home occupation in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| because it's operated out of the, I think there's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| The dog training is not a home occupation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| but also home occupations can't be operated out of an accessory building, which this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5330)|
| 1:29:03| What does he do in the accessory building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| Is it, I mean, is he kennel, or why does he have the accessory building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| My understanding is he does some of the training out of there, or she does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| some of the training out of the accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| If this was, didn't, oh, sorry, I didn't, no, go ahead, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| Well, I mean, she, could she do it legally without the accessory building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| Is that the hold up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| No, she can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| Mr. Dent, I was going to say, if this was denied, then what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| what would make you guys, I guess, allow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| Like, if they want it to rezone, would that be feasible in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| Because it's kind of like an island of low-density residential for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5386)|
| 1:29:54| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5394)|
| 1:29:54| No, it's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| I'm not sure, I mean, if they were to rezone, if they were to go into something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| I mean, it's already zoned agricultural, so if they were to go to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| that would be more appropriate, it'd have to probably, my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| probably go into something like commercial, which I'm not sure how that would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| and then you'd run into the sector plan challenges, and, so that's, that's my take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5410)|
| 1:30:19| What if it was agricultural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5419)|
| 1:30:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Yeah, I mean, I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| So it'd be kind of like a one-off if they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| Yeah, there's not a lot of ag in the, it's all LDR, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| there's not really any ag close, in any close proximity to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| There is one thing I just, because I have talked to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| and I wasn't sure if I was going to, I mean, we're, our stance is recommending denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5450)|
| 1:30:58| but one thing I do like about this is that they are proposing it in the rear yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| If, if it was in the front yard, it would be significantly closer to the adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5464)|
| 1:31:11| or I guess the residential neighborhood across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| So one thing I did notice when looking at the site plan is it is nice, that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| in the rear yard, there's trees that are, to some extent, buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| There's going to be a side fence, but it's, it's just one observation I did think would be worth sharing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| is that it is, it's about 250 feet from the road, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5489)|
| 1:31:39| It seems like the complaint that came in, or that kind of kick-started everything with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5499)|
| 1:31:46| the, and the neighbor that left the comment about the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| it almost seems like they're talking about dogs that are maybe owned by the person that lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| Do you know if that's the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| Yeah, so I've, I've received a few phone calls as well, in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| and, and I've also talked to the owner, and they do own a few large dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5522)|
| 1:32:10| and I, I think then you get into the conversation about, you know, I mean, people can own dogs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| And so it's, it's a little bit of a tricky one, because you could think of what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| the dog's coming in to be trained, it's just a, you know, small dog, maybe a quiet dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| I mean, it's not going to be noisy, but, yeah, I mean, from my understanding, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| the, the owner does own a couple German Shepherds, I think, or at least one, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| Yeah, because it definitely seems like there's two different things happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| One, they've got a neighbor with noisy dogs, which happens all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| but then also the owner happens to also be training dogs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| which may or not, may or may not be the cause of disruption to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| Yeah, and the question before us is, you know, as part of the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| is whether or not this commercial use is appropriate on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| So that's, you know, what the question before the planning commission is specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| And also to clarify, really, for us, is that low-density residential classification is really the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5592)|
| 1:33:19| the big one for what I've written in the report, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5599)|
| 1:33:26| Thank you, Levin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| Just one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| I kind of want to address one of the questions that one of the commissioners had regarding the rezoning on Kingwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5610)|
| 1:33:37| Just to let you know, you had asked about the accelerated bus corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| and there are two stops that are planned nearby along North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| One of them is at Cedar Lane and Esri, and the other one, or where those two meet, Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| The other one is at Hotel Road and North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| So just to let you all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| Any other questions for staff before we return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| Can I ask one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| I think it was the very first, number seven and number eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| the one off of Sutherland Avenue, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| Did you, was there consideration of recommending, instead of RN2, RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| to get some of that missing middle housing that was referenced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| We met with the applicant and did discuss that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| and the applicant's representative said he would contact the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| and we never heard anything from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| So they're looking for RN6 or BUST, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| Thank you all. See you on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210706-agenda-review?start=5683)|
