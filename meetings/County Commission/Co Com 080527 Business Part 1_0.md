| 0:01:59| who is the longest serving pastor of the oldest African-American church here in Knoxville, to lead today's devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=119)|
| 0:02:10| Shall we pray? Lord, we are thankful for the privilege of life for this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=130)|
| 0:02:18| We thank you for the opportunities that you've given us to serve and to share with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=138)|
| 0:02:27| Lord, we pray now that your presence would be in the midst of this commissioners meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| We pray for a meeting that will be productive. We pray for a spirit of unity, cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=154)|
| 0:02:45| We pray for wisdom and discernment that as they make decisions that may be difficult or easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=165)|
| 0:02:56| we pray that they will be guided and directed with your help. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=176)|
| 0:03:07| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=187)|
| 0:03:25| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=205)|
| 0:03:33| Do we have any amendments to the agenda? Everything to be added? Withdrawals and deferments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=213)|
| 0:03:59| Eric? Eric Coughlin, Knox County Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| I wanted to see if we could pull 103 from the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| We have several of the volunteers here in the audience today. We'd like to recognize their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| There's no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=256)|
| 0:04:26| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| I wanted to add a discussion item or actually two discussion items to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| I'll try to make them brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| First, I'd like to talk about adding civil service rules to Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| and then also the second would be an ordinance that would bring the fee offices budget under county commission control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=283)|
| 0:04:53| The ordinance I would like to, when I spoke to the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| we didn't have enough time to get it on this month's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=296)|
| 0:05:00| and we were possibly looking at June to place it on June's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| Are there any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| Seeing none, be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| Item 812 having to do with the independent auditor needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=317)|
| 0:05:30| I don't believe that on intergovernmental it was approved 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| I believe there were some no votes and probably need to correct the minutes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| What page is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| Page 10 and I think page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| I lost my place here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| But it does need to be pulled off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| 812 is Rutherford Moss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Yes, that's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| They're the independent auditor, the external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| We'll pull 812 off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| It should never have been on it because there were, I believe, four no votes on intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| I'd just like to make a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| I have a citizen from my district who wanted to take just a couple of minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| to present to this commission some information he has on our school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| and if we could move him up so he won't have to wait so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| Any objections seeing none?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| I just talked to the county clerk and I'd like to remove 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| He's going to get some additional information for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| When you say withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| Withdrawal 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| What's the page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Page 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=416)|
| 0:07:06| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| At the end you'll see for public forum A and then there's B, Chuck Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| He was wanting to convene at 7 o'clock to allow certain people to be in attendance after they got off work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=435)|
| 0:07:25| So you said he'll be here at 7 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| That's going to be at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| Hopefully we'll be through by then, but I'll try to get him here at least by 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| I like your thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| I like to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| Can I have a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| We've also added 8-13, if the commission would add it to its agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| It is a resolution to authorize me to file a motion for partial relief in the McElroy case to allow for the electronic communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=480)|
| 0:08:11| It's already on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| I need a motion for all additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Who's calling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Item number on page 24, item number 8-11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| is on the consent agenda to receive an operational audit report on the medical examiner's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| And each of you should have a copy of that printed report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| And what we would like to have is a chance to give a short verbal summary of that report today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| if that would please the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| You want to do it when 8-11 comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| It's on consent now, but we'd like to give a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| We'll remove that from the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| You want to remove it from consent, take it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| You want to hear it early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| That would be great if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| John almost had this thing whipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| Now I've got two more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Yeah, I'd like to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| It's on page 28, the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| It's R085-916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| There are several people in the courts that have questions about who gets the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| And I'd just like to make sure before we make that decision that we know where that money is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| I'd like to put it off and have some questions answered before I do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| I still support it, but I think it needs to be fully understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| What number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| It's on page 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| 916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| 916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Are there any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Objections to what, pulling it from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| No, he wants to pull it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| We may come to our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Page 4, 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| Obviously, we have, Chairman, we've gone ahead and conducted that honoring of the World War II veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=598)|
| 0:10:08| So, obviously, that's something that we've already taken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| So, I'd like to announce that if there's anyone that knows of a veteran who was not recognized today from World War II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| if they will let the Commission Office know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| My goal is for each one of the folks that are still living from World War II to recognize them with a proclamation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=623)|
| 0:10:33| and a resolution as we did those that were in attendance today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| Commissioner Daniels, could you give that e-mail address just so folks will know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=640)|

| 0:11:14| No, it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| 916 was approved by finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| I'm just talking about everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Do you want to put 916 for deferment also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| I wasn't talking about 916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| I was talking about things that were already unanimously deferred to go ahead and defer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=688)|

| 0:11:39| I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| But I believe Ivan Harmon is asking for 916 to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| That was what I think Commissioner McKenzie was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| We need to discuss that, I guess, if there's an objection, which I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=708)|

| 0:11:58| Oh, well, then I'll make a motion to defer 916 until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| I was just pointing out that the intergovernmental committee voted to defer, but the finance approved that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| so it wasn't both committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| We can vote on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| Commissioner Harmon had asked for it all to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=734)|

| 0:12:27| This is in regards to the lawsuit that was settled between the Board of Education and the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| It's my understanding that Mr. Beeler did not meet with them last week, so they haven't discussed it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| And so the law director is suggesting that we defer this for 30 days until legal counsel can meet with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| and then we can decide what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| So I'll make a motion we defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=766)|

| 0:29:59| and of the amazing Destination Imagination program encourages this kind of education for all children in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| Your support has helped these kids to spread enthusiasm, awareness, and interest in the greater Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| and you have thus been a part of a greater team effort to teach these seven children to give back to their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| We thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| If you know anybody who's interested in Destination Imagination, they can go to www.idudi.org| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:35| and get all kinds of information about the program or contact me, and I'll help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1845)|
| 0:31:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| We have one of the constituents in my district, I think, that wanted to speak for a few minutes to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| and address them on some issues regarding our schools and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| My name is Vic Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| I live in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| I came to this country from a communist country called Hungary at the age of 16 after a failed revolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:48| and proceeded to go to school here, and after all the schooling and five years in special ops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| I ended up with my lovely wife to decide to come down to the Knoxville area 14 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| and we never had a second thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| We loved this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| I did a little project starting four weeks ago when I was absolutely shocked by the discoveries that I have made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1927)|
| 0:32:16| and I want to relate that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| As a follow-up, I have a meeting scheduled with the Board of Education on the 4th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| I'll get right down to the punchline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| The USA high school education is 34th in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| Let that sink in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| USC is 38th to 41st in the USA, and I have all of the measurement data at my website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:48| which is knoxedu, K-N-O-X-E-D-U dot info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| It wasn't this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| When I went to school, we were a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| When you went to high school, I bet you that you saw things like trigonometry that many of you took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:09| It is no longer the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| At the same time, our universities are the best in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| If you take the top 20 universities in the world, 17 are American universities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| Two of them are from England, and one of them is the University of Tokyo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| What I'm telling you is that because of this decline in educational standard on a high school level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| this is why we are graduating less engineers, less scientists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| and we have less of them going into graduate programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| of which PhD programs are vital to our economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| because they are doing all the necessary research to come up with innovative products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| And for the last two decades, we have seen a lot of foreign products that came about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| and we bought them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Why? Because they were good, and we liked them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| This is from the automotive market to consumer electronics in a lot of areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| and we are giving up more and more of our industries because of this educational dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| Now, to be specific, what is missing from the curriculum is, on a high school level today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| Algebra II, Solid Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus I, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| Biology is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| But to complete it all, we need a much stronger math programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| exactly with the subjects that I described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| and a more comprehensive science program dealing with pure science and pure mathematics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| We can do something individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| Many of the high schools are teaching these very subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| If we came out and let the public know where we stand internationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| and stop the foolishness about comparing ourselves to ourselves within the USA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| to make us look good or to make a high school look good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| I think what the individuals could do is encourage their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| if they are average or better, to take these subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| They might not be required in the curriculum, but they could take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| And as a result, they could be admitted to a university, to an engineering or science course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| and they could go on to become PhDs to solve this awful problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| I will try to get this message across on the 4th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| We don't have to be magicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| It is not a difficult problem to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| We have to educate the public about the situation and tell the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| and realize the truth and then put some muscle behind all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| to improve what the children end up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| so that they can successfully enter the best universities in the world, which are right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| And with good grades, they can get full scholarships like my neighbor had for their two sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| At Harvard, all expenses paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| As you can see, I am a bit turned on about this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| I think it's extremely serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| I mentioned to you that I was in special ops for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| This is not unlike an economic engagement, a very clever one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| A lot of our dollars go to foreign countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| We are not getting the same amount back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Our balance of trade is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| Our donation has to resort to printing more money or more loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2214)|
| 0:37:03| The oil price, as a result, is zooming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| This is a major contributor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| And God knows where it's going to end unless we reverse this trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| So I would like to ask you to please remember what I said today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| because it is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| And when you see these bright-eyed kids that we saw right here in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| who were sitting back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| it is their future that's going to go down the drain and their children's future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| And I'm not asking anyone to do anything very special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| We've got to stop this business of thinking that they have to have more fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:50| They have to have some fun, but they have to produce like anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| And because us parents, we had a tough time, we are making it a little bit too easy perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| Anyway, I have a lot of information on my website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Please look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| I am not drawing conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| You've got the facts there, and I'm working more on a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| But please remember what I said, and thank you very much for the honor of speaking with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| I need your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| 11012 Flotilla Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2301)|
| 0:38:29| Telephone number 966.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| That's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Okay, 966-3004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| I have a one-page handout that I would like to pass to Mr. McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| if he would be kind enough to take one and pass it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| I'm going to assume that this gentleman was allowed to speak for such a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| And we do have a lady out in the audience that signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| And I think if we're going to allow people to speak at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| we should allow her to go ahead and speak at this time too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| instead of having to wait for how many hours we may be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| I think it would just be courteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| No objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| No objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| If that's a motion, I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Well, I just was going to give her that nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Ma'am, if you'd like to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| You're welcome to speak now or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| It's at your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| I'd go now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| I'd do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| You have our attention now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| And then have the option to stay or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| You're welcome to stay after you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| My name is Charlotte Lusk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| I reside at 5001 Hidden Haven Way, Blaine, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| I live inside Knox County, but we have a Granger County mailing address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| The state made improvements to Rutledge Pike and widened it into a four lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2396)|
| 0:40:03| which has created a lot of problems in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| In doing so, there is a gas station located at the corner of Hidden Haven Way and Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:15| Part of our road, which only has five residents since it was taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| it is now a state road that is maintained by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| And where we previously had a private drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| now we basically have our gravel road attached to their parking lot, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| They drew a white line down through there to prevent supposedly people not exiting at the proper exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| So when we come in and out, we're constantly having to dodge vehicles coming in and out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| That portion of the state road that attaches to the gas station parking lot is maintained by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:59| So our taxes installed this new improvement entrance for this man, and we maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:08| I worked with the state and the county over this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| I came and installed these cement things that look like bumper stoppers in parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| to prevent all these cars from just coming willy-nilly out onto the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| And the owners of the gas station, because they have a lot of large trucks, electric trucks, cherry pickers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| all different kinds of things, drove across these speed bump things until they've broken them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| One set of them they ripped out with a bulldozer in order to get them out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| because they didn't like them being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| And I would like the commission to address this issue, and I went through the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| and they told me there's no money in the budget for guardrails to be put up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| not even addressing the fact that they had ripped out this state and county property intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| I have photographs of these areas that show the scar marks on top of these traffic barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:14| where they've driven over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| They informed the state that the only reason that they broke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| was because they were put in after the blacktop was down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| In addition, this gas station is operating a restaurant there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| and they only have approval on the septic for one restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| When I addressed this issue to the powers that be in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| they told me that they're approved for a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Well, they may have the approval from the county for a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| but they do not have the approval from the state for a septic in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| for anything other than one bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| They've had problems with the septic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| They had to buy property behind the gas station and pump their sewage up on the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| so that it came down drain fills there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| There's a watershed and a creek at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| They allowed that to collapse and become all grown up, and Neal Hall came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| They forced them to put in additional drain fills, told them not to let this grow up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| It's all grown up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| The odor in the neighborhood when it rains or there's heavy fog is terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| The people that drive these trucks that come in and out of there are urinating in the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| not even going inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| They have two elderly neighbors on the west side of me, a widow woman who's approximately 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| and her sister who's in her 70s who see these men standing out there in the parking lot urinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| Their trash is constantly on the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| And now they've put us on regular pickups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| Our tax dollars are having to pick up beer bottles and Coke bottles and food wrappers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| and all this sort of thing from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| We had to have hazardous people come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| They relocated the gas station over to the other side of the lot when they expanded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| I had to get hazardous people come in there to haul out a semi-truck flatbed of tires that were back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| that they refused to remove and old gas tanks that go underground from when they reloaded the gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:24| Mr. Watson, who owns this, sent a message to me that he owns Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| We lost our private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| We lost safe entrance to our house and our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| We have trash in our front door constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| We have an odor problem from septic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| I would like the commission to force these people to come in compliance with the state septic laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| and install enough septic so that we don't have this odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| I would like for the water people to check the creek that's behind this gas station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| at the bottom of that hill to see if it's being polluted by their septic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| I would like some kind of barrier put between our road and this gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| I told them I don't care if it's those cement things like they sit out on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| Surely I have 10 or 12 of them sitting around somewhere that they could block this off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| so we can come and go on our street without worry about getting hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| And if they remove them, I'd like them to be held accountable for destroying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| or removing state and county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| I see we have a few lights on. Commissioner Luther?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| I don't see Grant Rosenberg. Is he in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| Is there someone from Office of Neighborhood or if the mayor or someone would like to speak about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| Well, I'm talking about the inspectors, so I'll get to the roads here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| Well, I believe the inspector, codes enforcers, inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| are now underneath the preview of the Office of Neighborhoods. Is that right, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| Hasn't been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Hasn't been approved. Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I would also like to know, someone told me that if the county or state takes part of your road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| they have to take it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| The only part of our road they took was enough to give the gas station an entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| I went through the Tennessee Department of Safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| There's numerous accidents down there. They're increasing every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| Down the road from us on Rutledge Pike at Circle Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| they told us the reason they did our road the way they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| is so people wouldn't have to make a U-turn to get in the gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| But at Circle Road, there's another store down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| People are driving down the wrong side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| They've worn all the emergency side off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| Coming out onto Circle Road, there's numerous, numerous accidents there, some fatalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| from the situation where they drive down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| And there is, they would not move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| There is a place where you can exit that other store and go out and turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| No one has access to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| There's a house on each side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| They have to drive down the wrong side of the road if they want to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| We have a couple of more questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Well, I wasn't through if you're right, Mr. Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| I guess, Jim Snowden, I guess we'll start with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| Have you been out there or do you know what the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| Yes, Jim Snowden, Ensuring Public Works, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| I have, Commissioner Leuthold, the curbs that Ms. Lisk is referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:37| that the state put in as part of their construction project, Knox County didn't put those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| We have went out and done some paving for Ms. Lisk, as well as I believe we did a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| to notify the end of the public right-of-way into the private easement of Ms. Lisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| So, yes, I have been out there and I'm aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| So, are we doing anything to correct this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| Could you make sure someone goes out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| We've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| And what we, the curb that the state put in, they didn't really do that good a job with it to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| And it is torn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| My personal opinion is that although there is open frontage there, there is not per se a safety problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:22| I feel like putting up a barrier, like maybe Ms. Lisk is referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| would create maybe more of a safety problem than it would improve, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| There is a good sight distance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| It is my understanding that TDOT realigned or did this as a safety improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| because intersections used to be somewhat offset and now they line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| Essentially, one was here and one was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| Now they brought them together was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| I have obviously a state project, so I don't know the full details of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| Could you just get with her later on and make, you know, see if there are some things that maybe you can get together on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2939)|
| 0:49:06| I've already worked with Mr. Snowden, and I have pictures here that will show you that these were ripped out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| that they're being driven over constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Their solution to this is a white stripe down the middle of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| They're not the people exiting from our homes, which comes from a private drive or a private road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| having to dodge these people flying in and out of this gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| There was no need for them to relocate anything, no need whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:38| But if they intended to do it at our road, they should have also done it at Circle Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| which is a far more dangerous intersection and also where people are driving down the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| and where they have to come out of that store and do a U-turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| which they said the reason they did it to us is so people wouldn't have to do a U-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| Ms. Slusk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| If I'm asking Jim or someone within the engineering department to go out there and get with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| and see if there's something they can do to help resolve this situation, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| Yeah, I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| I wasn't aware of the issue with Circle Road, so I will look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Now, is there anybody here from the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| It's the health department that has to approve septic tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Is that not correct, Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Grant Rosenberg, Suite 345, City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Has there been a proper permit for a septic tank that's for a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| Yeah, and environmental health has been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| I spoke with Ronnie about an hour ago, Ronnie Neese, with our environmental health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| and I had the file, handed it to Mark Jones, and he must have just stepped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| But the permit is in compliance from everything I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| They have the permit for a septic for a restaurant, not just a single.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| They do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| If you could get that information to her and double-check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| Neal Hall is the man that handles that for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| I went back to him after they told me it was approved by the county for the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| Neal Hall said only the restaurant is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| There is no septic approved for that restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| The only septic approved by the state, which is what requires it on your septic, is for one bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| Grant, will you just make sure that everything out there is in compliance as far as the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| and have the inspectors, since I believe the inspectors are underneath your police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| No, environmental health inspectors are under Ronnie Neese, which is environmental health under the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| I've spoken to Ronnie about this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| He's assured me the permit is in compliance, everything is in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| Will you double-check that for me and for her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| I'll double-check and follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Would you have him check that with Neal Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Neal Hall works there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| If you will double-check that with Neal Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Ms. Leslie lives in my district there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| I'll be glad to accompany Grant and Jim out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| And, Ronnie, if he wants to go, I think hopefully we can tell you what the county can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| I'm not sure what we can make the state do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| Well, it's a state road, but the county agreed to maintain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| which was another battle for a year in getting trash picked up and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| He did ask if you take over part of the road if you take over all the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Yes. Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| They told me if you took part of a road that you had to take it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| They've created a crossroad at a place where five people live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| and not created a crossroad down the store where I don't know how many people live down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| There are more pictures of broken curbs where they've driven across them and ripped them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| What is the county going to do about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| The destruction of this public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Our tax dollars are paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| Ms. Lewis, I believe the engineering department and Commissioner Ballard will escort them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| I'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| I'll be glad to go out with you and Ronnie and Jim and anybody else in codes, roads or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| If you'll set up the appointment with her, then I'll try to work my schedule in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| Possibly someone from engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| And I would request a follow-up next month on this to see what's been done about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| Thank you, Ms. Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| I want to approve of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:44| I need a motion for approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Previous meeting about April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| I'll get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Properly moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Elections and appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3235)|
| 0:54:04| First resolution is R-08-5-110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| This is a resolution appointing members to the Knox County Health Insurance Appeals Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Vote at 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| I believe we voted 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| We have some names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| Can I get a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| I think I have some of the sheets that were passed out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| You know, I think the human resources has supplied us with some names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| but, you know, as we talked about it for months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| to see if someone that a commissioner may know to serve on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:52| Because the names they submitted to us, I think some of them could have indirect conflicts maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| But, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| Does everyone have a sheet that was passed out today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| A motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| I make a motion we accept the four names listed on this, Deborah York, Logan Brummett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| Irma Thompson, and Abe Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| Mr. Chairman, I have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| As you notice before you, you have several notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| Commissioner DeFries has written one for the personnel board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| I have written one for both boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| And I appreciate these names coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| I realize the irony of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| For two months we had no names, and now we have an abundance of names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| But I think it would be better to put together sort of a compromise panel for these two boards of everyone's suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| My compromise panel would be maybe Deborah York, Laurie Stevens, Chuck Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| and Logan Brummett for personnel, Frank Robinson, Pamela Tracy, Abe Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| and Wardell Milan for the health appeals board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3361)|
| 0:56:10| That would be fairly well balanced by who nominated them, by from where they come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3370)|
| 0:56:17| various districts, by background, by demographics, by gender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| And so I'm going to suggest those four names for personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| and those four names for the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| And as a substitute motion, that would be a good compromise for all of the names that have come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| Mr. Chairman, can we take them one at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| and address the health insurance or the health appeals board first and then the personnel board second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| Yeah, I think we're going to have to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:56| Could you repeat those names for the health insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| I mean, I'm just trying to put together a compromise of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| I mean, you'll see that I have put together a list of six people, three for personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| and three for the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| But I thought combining my list with the ones before us, a good compromise list would be Frank Robinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| Pamela Tracy, Abe Brown, and Wardell Milan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| It would seem to be a drawing from everyone and everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:30| I don't have a problem with those names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| I'll withdraw mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| Was that on the health or personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| I think we're doing health first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| I've listed names that I thought were personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:48| I'll second those names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| Would you go over those one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| You said Frank Robinson, Pamela Tracy, Wardell Milan, and Abe Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| Is that correct, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| We do have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| You second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| And I don't mind having more people coming on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| Is Francis here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| I thought I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Francis, can you step forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:22| You know, ladies and gentlemen, here's just what I feel the bottom line is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| We've had this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Francis, how long have we been looking at this, five months, six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Since January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| We haven't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| We haven't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| We've asked Francis to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| She goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| She did a lot of research on these names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| And now we're going to say, well, that's not good enough for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| I think we need to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| You know, and we're fixing to do the same thing with this community grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| We're doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| I can see it coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| You know, to me this is a slap in the face to Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| We don't appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| We're going to come up with our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| And I'm sure these names that we've come up with, they're good individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| But we've sat here on our tails and done nothing for five or six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| We ask her to help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| She does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| And we say, well, that's not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| So, Francis, I'm going to support the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| I'm not going to take it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| The only thing that I ask is to remember that there are criteria for the Health Insurance Appeals Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3557)|
| 0:59:24| Make sure that two of your names represent people with substantive professional experience in financial management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3564)|
| 0:59:34| and that the other two names have substantive professional experience in human resources and benefits administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:42| So you need to make sure that that need is met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| When you get to the personnel board, there are no particular criteria for professional experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| But for health insurance, make sure you've identified which two hold the financial management experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3592)|
| 1:00:01| and which two hold the human resources and benefits administration experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| I would like to make a substitute motion that we take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| We already have one substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| We do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| That was his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Well, I withdrew mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| So we don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| I withdrew mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| He withdrew his, so his is the main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| I make a substitute motion to take for the Health Insurance Appeals Board these names submitted to us here that Francis has given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| Would you list those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Will you read those off, those names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| With Bill Taylor, Frank Robinson, Wardell Milan, and Dave Parmley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:41| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| Well, now that Commissioner Smith has made that one, I actually, as I looked at Abe Brown, he worked for Cherokee Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3650)|
| 1:01:00| and that may potentially be a conflict with the Health Insurance Appeals Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| It's probably fuzzy, so I was going to ask to have that reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| But now that we have this motion, I'll go with those four names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| Well, Abe Brown had been asked to be appointed to the personnel board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| But Commissioner Harmon read his name off as one of the four for the Health Insurance Appeals Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| We own two boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Yes, I would just like to respond to Commissioner Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| You know, in all fairness, there are a number of us who were appointed at the end of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| and so I think maybe your comments directed to some of the newer members of this board, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| when we came on, we've absorbed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| And so we're all learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| And I think maybe that might be why you see a few more names before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3708)|
| 1:01:55| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3726)|

| 1:02:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| The next two members will be Bill Talley, Frank Robertson, Wardell Milan, and Dave Parmley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| 111?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3737)|
| 1:02:26| The resolution, I'm sorry, 111, is appointing four members to Knox County Personnel Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:36| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Voted 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| 9-1, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| I make a motion that we approve with the following names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| Pamela Tracy, Laurie Stevens, Chuck Williams, and Logan Brummett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| That draws from everybody's list as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| I'd like to substitute motion to approve what Francis has already done for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| the names that are submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| Commissioner Smith, if you'll read those names off for the record, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| just so everybody knows which names we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Deborah York, Logan Brummett, Irma Thompson, Abe Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| Sir, can I make a comment about those names that may not be evident to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| but we were fairly careful in this to make sure that we had a good representation for race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:51| gender, and ethnicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| So if these four names that are on the list that I submitted do meet all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| As does my list with Chuck Williams, Pamela Tracy, Chuck Williams, very diverse list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Francis, will you tell us just what you did, the research that you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| how you obtained these names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Did people give them to you to come out of the blue with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| Tell the commission here what efforts you have done to come up with these names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| The mayor's nomination is one that he provided there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| The other three names are people that we know from professional organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| or that we've encountered in ways like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| That's specifically Deborah York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| and Irma Thompson are persons that other staff know from professional organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:39| or from work associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point out that the reason I have an alternate list is not anything against these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| good people or what Frances put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| She's put together a really good list, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| But we had a hearings process for appointees, and we identified wonderful people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| some of whom we put on this body, others we wished we had room for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| And I said at that time, we should keep these people in mind for boards and commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| Well, here is that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| I reached out to these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Maybe I did it a month or two too late, but I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| That's Logan Brummett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| He's one of those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Logan Brummett is on my list as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Chuck Williams is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| Pamela Tracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Laurie Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| I just think if we're going to have a process that allows commissioners to reach out to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| as I put this out on listservs and I called those individuals from their resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| that we should respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| And on at least one of these two boards, let's go with that process rather than Frances' list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| which is also a good list, and we overlap on one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| We have a substitute motion on the floor to accept Deborah York, Logan Brummett, Irma Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| and Abe Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=3952)|

| 1:06:59| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| Yes, Mr. Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| So, the four names that I read off will be the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| Francis, thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| Resolution 112 is approving the appointment of Martha S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| and the reappointment of Harry Call, Jim Harrison, and Alvin Nance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| to the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| and the Health, Educational, and Housing Facility Board of the County of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| Nine-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| Nine-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| A motion or a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| Do you want to go first, Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| I'd like to make a motion to approve these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| I'd like to make a substitute motion, Mr. Chairman, that we appoint Carl Tindall, Alvin Nance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4072)|
| 1:08:04| Jim Renfro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:15| and Charles Benton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:26| And I do so because, as we know now, Knox County has decided we're going to have term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:33| And these appointments are for a six-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| And I think there's other people in the community that can serve us well on these boards, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| and just kind of rotate people off so they don't just stay there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| I think we all have the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| Is Mr. Edwards still in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| Mike, will you come and speak to this motion, please, give us your interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:21| Mike Edwards, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| It's the way we discussed it at committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:38| The IDB was formed in the mid-'60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| The state, the legislation, and which is also reflected in the charter and the bylaws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:51| that if that nominees should come from the chamber or the Board of Trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4191)|
| 1:10:00| assuming that there are people who are acceptable from that body and to serve, but it is your appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:16| Since 1964, because of the nature of the work, because of what is required in regard to bond issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4216)|
| 1:10:27| and the health ed board, the hospital piece is pretty complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4227)|
| 1:10:39| And now because of TIFs and a brand-new use of a tax abatement in the form of tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4239)|
| 1:10:47| that are outside the normal use of job growth, it is very important that the skill sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:57| that are represented on the board of IDB is a mix of those skill sets that are going to be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4257)|
| 1:11:06| I mean, it's important to have attorneys with transaction backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| It's important to have bankers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| It's important to have people with hospital background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| And it's also now important to have people who understand real estate development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| particularly retail real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| So, Mr. Edwards, do you feel like your nominees match this skill set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| And do you have any idea of the skill set of those persons that Commissioner Moore is nominating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4293)|
| 1:11:41| I'm familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| I'm very familiar with Mr. Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| I have become somewhat familiar with Mr. Renfro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| Unless I'm missing a name with a face, I'm not familiar with the third gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4312)|
| 1:12:03| But it's the two people that are two of the people that would be being replaced are developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:15| And that is a particular skill set right now that we need someone who can look at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| from a developer's eyeballs and try to get an understanding of really what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4342)|
| 1:12:32| I would ask for our law director if he would comment on what Mr. Edwards had said that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| I'm aware that the nominee should be a member of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Where does it say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| And I looked at the bylaws or whatever the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| Where does it say in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| And just correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| But, you know, where does it say that the commission must choose from the nominees provided by the chamber?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:09| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| Or by the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| It would be generated by the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| It is an extraordinary, I think you have to agree with this, without understanding the intent of the legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:24| it is an extraordinary piece of legislation that they would require that you draw from the membership of the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4404)|
| 1:13:34| When I first read that, you know, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| But the reasoning is, is that this is a very powerful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| and important function that the legislature wanted to have dual reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:54| In other words, they wanted to certainly understood the need for the elected body to have approval rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| but they also wanted the private sector, particularly that group that would have the skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| in the business acumen to look at these types of transactions that are coming in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4448)|
| 1:14:17| In order for us to stand in front of you, as you've asked us to do in the past, and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4457)|
| 1:14:24| well, this needs to go to the IDB, they are the experts, and we're going to rely on them in a large measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:34| The only way to get to that expertise is to look at the folks who deal with these types of issues throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:46| That's the argument against term limits, you know, for your trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| and for the other offices in Knox County government because you've got experience in those offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| But we know where we are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Herb, am I missing something here from your bylaws?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| Not necessarily from our bylaws, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| The enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Herbert Slattery, 900 South Gay Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| The enabling legislation requires that the members of the board be chosen from recommendations from the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:27| If you choose not to do that, then the commission has to make a finding that, in your judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| there are no members who really fit those qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| So there has to be a specific finding of this body that members of those organizations really do not qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:45| And I think that's sort of an unusual, but it's in the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| It's 753-301, Mr. Owens, if you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| The other point I think needs to be made is that there's two that are omitted from the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4554)|
| 1:16:03| are serving unexpired terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| So they have not been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| This is not a they have not been there for one full term yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| Their predecessor, I believe, one of them was Richard Cate, who resigned because of his position with county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:22| He was going to be an official of the county and serve on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| And then there was another banker who moved out of town, and his term was being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| The unexpired term was being served by Harry Call, who was one of the other members of the board suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| in the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| I've been representing this board for a long time, since 83 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| And, frankly, you all have done a great job of appointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| This body has done a great job of appointing the people that we need on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| They have to they really do have to have a mix of gifts, as Mr. Edwards has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| And it's very unusual to see New York underwriters come into town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| and face up to the bank executives, to the developers, to the kind of financial sophistication that our members have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:18| and get instant respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| And they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| They get instant respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| And this system has been in place, and we can tweak it however you wish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| but it's been in place for as long as I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| One board was set up in 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| One board was set up in 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| And the chamber was instrumental in setting up both boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| and they have always served up a recommendation, had the administration review the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| and brought it to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| But the mix is really of gifts and experience is really, really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| I mean, they need to know about bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| They need to know a difference between a variable rate and a fixed rate bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| They need to know what a private placement is and a public issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| All these things make a lot of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| And it's no small numbers either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| It's every project is a multimillion-dollar project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| So we can't overemphasize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| I'll be glad to answer any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Do you sit in on these meetings when these companies come in for grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| So do you advise these members of what their responsibilities are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| All the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| My favorite question is, is this legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| See, that's what we do with our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| When we don't understand something, we hope somebody in that meeting is going to have enough information for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| But there are certain areas that I can't speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| For instance, the bond markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| One of the resolutions you passed just in this meeting dealt with auction rate bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| Now, that particular instrument is there's a financial upheaval in the markets today because the Wall Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| financial institutions won't support those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| Well, those bonds happen to be issued by the hospitals that we have issued bonds for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| So somebody needs to know about that other than the lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| And it's a financial piece to it that is not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| I've called for the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| They're going to bring it down to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| Can we put this one off for a few minutes and come back to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| Give me time to read the statute to double check as far as the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| Must it come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| I mean, I have no reason to doubt her, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| I'll be happy to read it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| I've got a copy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| I didn't think you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| You were just citing me to the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| But I can read it for myself if you'll bring it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:49| Mr. Edwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| See what you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| You know, I talked to you earlier in the finance committee meeting we talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| Would you be willing to give us two names for each position from now on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| And would you be willing also that anybody that has served two terms not to submit their name back to us again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| Well, I think what we would do is we would amend the bylaws to restrict two terms, beyond two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4819)|
| 1:20:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| And you'd be willing to do that and also be willing to give us two names for every position it needs to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:37| And would you do that approximately maybe two months before these terms expire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| where we would have a chance to go over the resumes real good and contact these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Commissioner Pinkston, was that two full terms or two terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| Well, it would be two full terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| Mr. Edwards, the way this board is made up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| it looks to me like it seems to be very heavily toward folks that live within either the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:16| or in the city of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| Another thing I notice when I look at issues like tax increment financing and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| is that there tends to be more of that used within the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| and they don't seem to be getting a lot of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| Now, it may just be that the ones that I've looked at have been projects that were not worthy of a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| But what I'm wondering is do you think it's appropriate for this board to be so saturated with folks that live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:51| either the town of Farragut or the city of Knoxville when there's a huge majority of this county that is not within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:59| one of the incorporated cities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| Well, what we --if I'm looking here, and I think we sent this out, there are four commissioners who live in the --| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:18| I think like seven out of ten live in an incorporated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| Two in the seventh, one in the sixth, one in the ninth, one in the second, one in the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| But how many of those live outside of an incorporated area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| And what I'm saying, I'm not disagreeing with either of the decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| because I could certainly see where a person could go either way with one of those TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| I could see some justification for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| I could see some justification against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| But it just looks to me like that tool that's a really good tool, a lot of folks don't understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| and I catch a lot of criticism from folks that don't understand what you can do with a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:10| But it just seems like they always tend to be used in the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| and they're approved by a board that's overwhelmingly populated with folks from the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| And I'm just wondering if maybe there might be some benefit to having a more balanced board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:29| maybe having some folks that don't live downtown or don't live in incorporated Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:37| The TIFs that you are the ones that you're dealing with in abundance are the TIFs that are coming to you from KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:51| And they are, by definition, bringing to you TIFs that are proposed to cure blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:59| They are going to be coming from a great part of the city, and that is a city-appointed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:09| There's also a city industrial development board that you could get a TIF request from as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:19| The county IDB, the people on there that are sitting on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| are really looking at the economics and the justification and does it make sense for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5065)|
| 1:24:34| It is not trying to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| Where you folks come in is only from the elected side is looking at the north, south, east or west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5081)|
| 1:24:51| But what we're doing, hopefully, is giving a very analytical look at these things to see if they, in fact, make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5091)|
| 1:25:01| One of the biggest things IDBs do are the pilot programs, and that is pure job growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:09| And we can --it's not as simple as this, but figuring out a company that would qualify for a pilot is a relatively easy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:21| Figuring out how much TIF to give to a developer gets extremely complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| And it has taken this IDB about a year to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:36| It is a testament to their due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| It is not to say that we can't put more different people on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| I think that they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| But it is when you really start to dig into these things, they look they're a lot more complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5146)|
| 1:25:54| And the implication to the county and to the county's revenue stream are significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| Are there any of you did you when you put this list together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| did you take into consideration of whether they were living in an incorporated or unincorporated area of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:15| No, we try our very best to look at, one, skill sets, two, diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:22| We want to make sure that we do have we think that we have a pretty good representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| even though we do not have all the county, all the districts represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| But I think we have a pretty good representation of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:43| I'm thinking a good number of them live outside the incorporated part of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:50| I don't know about Farrigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| What I'm hearing is that seven out of the ten live in either the town of Farrigate or within the Knoxville city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5211)|
| 1:27:00| And I guess that's what I'm looking at is that we have a lot more suburbs within Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| than we do incorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| And that's what I was looking at in the name of diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| It might be nice to mix it up a bit and put some folks on there that are from unincorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:21| I'm all directed through Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| We did get the statute, and thanks, Herb, for providing your copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:30| But looking at it, it looks like the directors shall be chosen by you, the governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5250)|
| 1:27:40| We agree that the governing body is the Knox County Commission, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| From the membership of any one or more of such organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| and those are Chamber of Commerce, Board of Trade, or other similar civic organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:58| So you must choose the membership from one or more of such organizations unless, in your judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:07| there are no members of such organizations who are both suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| and available to serve as directors of the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| So I don't know if Carl Tindall and Mr. Nance, Mr. Renfrow, Mr. Benton are members of any of the organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:26| that you wish to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| Mr. Law Director, if they're not members, I guess they could join prior to getting sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:42| Well, it says shall be chosen by the governing body from the membership of any one or more of such organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5322)|
| 1:28:51| My question would be what organizations are Tindall, Nance, Renfrow, and Benton a member of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| It doesn't say that it has to be the Knoxville, Knox County, Knoxville Chamber of Commerce or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:06| It just says other civic organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| Other similar civic organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| But I think the thinking behind it, well, first of all, Alvin Nance is a member of the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| because he's an existing board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| But the sense of it is that I think behind the statute is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5360)|
| 1:29:26| not that it excludes other organizations, but we've followed the chamber's lead because it represents all of the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:33| in Knox County, not in a particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| And it's just been a tradition and something we've, a practice we've followed for X number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| Now, that's, you know, complies with the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| But if the commission wishes to do otherwise, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| But that's how we've proceeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to add, you know, over the past year, Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| we've done things for a long time by electing people for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| But it's a new day in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| And I think now we have energized more people, more people wanting to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| And we shouldn't shun these people when they come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| Mr. Carl Tindall is a member of the Brinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| He's chairman of the National Lumber Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| He's the chairman of the Southern Building Material Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| He serves on, chairman of the Northside YMCA Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| Mr. Renfro is a financial person from Commercial Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| These people in our community have stepped forward and said, you know, we'd be willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| So not saying nothing bad about the other people you've nominated, but, you know, they've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| They've done their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| And we ought to give other people an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| I know you all don't like that, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| But because you all have these people, you say they've learned how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| You know, they've got the institutional knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| But, you know, we need to let other people serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| And that's my only reason for making a substitute motion with the other names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| I was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:13| And thank you, Mr. Slattery, for coming and helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| Would you summarize just for the nominees that we have in the resolution, just quickly for us, their experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:27| Tell us a little bit about each one of those again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| We have a substitute motion on the floor, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| And the substitute motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Names that Commissioner Moore presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| And that's the reason why I would like to have just a mention of these quickly before the vote is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:51| Now, you're asking for the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| For Ms. Whalen, Harrison, Call, and Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| Missy Whalen is an executive with Branch Banking and Trust and has years of banking experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| If appointed, she would be just the second woman on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| We have one woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| So that is a diversity concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:17| She also is one of the empty positions was one of the executives, bank executives, has recently resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:27| So we anticipated her taking that position because we needed additional banking experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| and finance experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| Alvin Nance, I believe everybody knows Alvin with his experience with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| But he also has a banking background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| He's also helped immensely in putting together the pilot program and the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| He brings a unique aspect to housing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| And, for instance, I received a call just last week on a housing proposal at the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5574)|
| 1:33:01| which is a little different for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| But we typically would turn to somebody like Alvin to give us some expertise on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| and whether KCDC should handle it rather than the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| Harry Call and Jim Harrison are both serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| They've never been appointed to a full term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| Now, Jim Harrison was appointed, I believe, just a year and a half ago at most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:28| He is a real estate developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| He worked with the chamber and is intimately familiar with TIFs and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:39| Harry Call is similarly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| He's got he has corporate experience and private business with a very large entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:51| He's also been involved in real estate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| He has actually done a TIF on his own in another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| And was very helpful in putting the TIF program together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| So both of them have been very important to us as far as bringing the TIF program up to speed and informing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5643)|
| 1:34:11| In fact, at one of the TIFs, one meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| we were sort of at an impasse on basically wanting the developer to do what they said that they would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| what you told them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| And Mr. Call and Mr. Harrison in about ten minutes came up with a provision in an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| that held them accountable for those particular decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| Frankly, I was amazed that we were able to do that in just like 15 minutes when it normally would take three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:43| So, Mr. Slater, you have a lot of confidence in these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| Now, would you just quickly summarize their years of experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| So Ms. Wallen is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| She'll be a new appointment to a six-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| Mr. Call is a partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| He served a partial term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| And that's how many years of service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| I think I've got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| Mr. Call was appointed in January, January 26th of 2004 to fill in the unexpired term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:19| This would be his first full term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| Jim Harrison was appointed April 16th of 2007 to fill in the unexpired term of Richard Cate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| which was set to expire, which will expire July 15th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| Alvin Nance was reappointed in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| Alvin has more experience than all of the other, than the other three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| And Ms. Wallen would, this would be her first appointment to a six-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| So one of the objections has been voiced is that this sounds like this is an ancient group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5750)|
| 1:35:57| as far as their experience, and that's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| So I appreciate you clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| Mike or Herbert, when will these appointments need to be seated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| In July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| Mr. Mike, obviously this is a very powerful position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| I mean, the IDB board controls a whole lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| controls the welfare of a whole lot of developments, positively or negatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:39| I agree with one of the commissioners who made the comment, you know, 12 years is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| That's a kingdom building opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| How, I don't know that I've heard the answer to this yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| but the ones that you guys are looking to have either re-upped or to come on board, who actually chose those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5813)|
| 1:37:06| I mean, was there one person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Was there six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| How many different people and where did they come from to make these selections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| It was me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| And representing as CEO of the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| Now, on the three appointments, the custom has been, are you in agreement to continue to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5843)|
| 1:37:32| They can say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| They can say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| We can present them and you can accept or decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:41| What really works because of the way Herbert explained it is that there is a matrix of trying to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:51| that we cover as much of the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| And as now Commissioner Lambert says, we need some balance, if that's the will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5876)|
| 1:38:04| of inside the incorporated and outside the incorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| Though a great load of population is in one of those two incorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| But I agree that now you're really putting up diversity, you're putting up skill sets, you're putting up all in all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5894)|
| 1:38:21| So it really takes somebody to think through what you have remaining on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| and where are you going to need those gaps filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| And, Mike, that doesn't concern me as much as, you know, we recently had, I mean, we've had in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| one of the members of the IDB board was involved in bankruptcies of two different companies, didn't pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5919)|
| 1:38:48| That scares me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| Who was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| That, you know, I mean, I would expect the backgrounds of the individuals that serve on this to be above sterling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5933)|
| 1:39:03| I don't expect them to be spotted with that kind of atrocities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| I think that is just deplorable that our IDB board would recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:15| and then we would approve folks with that type of character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| And to me, if I was from outside and I come walking into a room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| and we had that type of character serving, I wouldn't be impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| And I think when people walk in looking to invest in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| that they need to be impressed with the backgrounds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| I don't know any of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| I do know at least one of the ones that Commissioner Moore brought up, but I do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:48| the only thing I can go on is what you're telling me about these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| because I can tell you I don't know the ones you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| And that does cause me some concern on how I would vote for these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| Not because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| They may be the greatest people on the earth, but I don't know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| And I don't know their backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| You've told me what they are, but I don't know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| And obviously before it's been told about others that they were sterling representatives of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| when maybe they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| Well, I can tell you that the four that have been nominated enjoy the highest reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6019)|
| 1:40:36| that you can enjoy in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| Missy Wallin is president of BB&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| Chances are her taxes are up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| I would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| And as is Harry Call, Harrison, and Alvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:53| I would also say that both Carl Tindall and Clem Renfro and I'm certain that those folks have the highest reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6053)|
| 1:41:14| in our sterling citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| I don't think that is an issue in regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| And I just can't speak to the other one, the incident that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| I have a problem with the reappointments and also the six-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| I don't have necessarily problems with any of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| although looking in the literature that you handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| I did notice that Nance and Harrison both happen to be serving on the county health and education board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:55| and that Harry Call serves on the covenant health board and also the Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6115)|
| 1:42:01| So it seems that they also have all three of those are into the health boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:07| I've heard from the podium custom, tradition, practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| and that they need diversity, skill sets, mix of gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| And I believe in the appointment process that we all witnessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| As Commissioner Mark Harmon suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| that we saw a variety of people come forward who had diversity, unique skill sets, and mix of gifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:30| And I do believe those people are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| And I know for those of us who have been appointed, we have had to do a crash course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| because we don't have institutional knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| And since we are sunshine, we have very brief moments where we can even glean institutional knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| And I think that the old boy mentality just does not comply with Knox County public sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6168)|
| 1:42:56| I think that we need to mix things up a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| I think even a partial term of six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| I think two six-year terms, I don't think that Knox County wants to go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:10| So I just wanted to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| And I'm in agreement for mixing this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| The six-year terms are stated in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:26| Secondly, the reference to Mr. Harrison and Mr. the ones who are members of the health ed board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6206)|
| 1:43:37| they're all members of the health ed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| The county IDB serves as the health ed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| And Mr. Call serves on a board member or a former board member, I'm not sure his status, of covenant health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:56| which means he recuses himself and walks out of the room any time that there is an issue that involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6236)|
| 1:44:06| The truth of the matter is, whether it is mercy or covenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| it is not something that they gain in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| Everybody understands how it works and why it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| You know, one of the things Commissioner Harmon said about it's a they've got herb to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:28| But the reason you have a board is to have people who have knowledge of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| that can ask people who are consultants who are knowledgeable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| but then to make a determination of what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| Otherwise, you could just have Herbert act as the IDB board and there you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:52| So I think it's important to have people who deal with these types of matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| I do not think that there's anything necessarily sacred about the board members that have been recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6296)|
| 1:45:07| or the new person that will be recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| A couple of things responding back to Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| The majority of the members of this board come from a very wonderful district, the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| have a lot of respect for the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| But the majority of this body lives within the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:37| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| The one from the fifth district just happens to live within the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| You know, the fifth district is the reason why we have three commissioners up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| when everybody else has two is because we're 50% larger by population than the rest of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6347)|
| 1:45:55| And we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| And I guess my question is, with the last census, it was a little over 60,000 residents that you could only find one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6356)|
| 1:46:05| to sit on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| And you're simply going to reappoint him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| Don't have a problem with Harry Call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| Think he'd be an excellent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| And I look at the other districts and I see a lot of districts maybe have just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| So why is it that you continuously come back with people from the fourth district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:35| Two years ago, this thing was on the consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| And you knew your address back then, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| Since the 60s, this thing has been a sleeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| We didn't have TIFs like we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| And to tell you how complicated this is, one of the substitute motions lives in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6416)|
| 1:47:05| It is when you're looking at who to put in these places, it is district representation is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:15| But, boy, so is a whole lot of other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| When this has been a very conservative IDB, and I would argue that you want it to be a very conservative IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:28| If you get a recommendation from the IDB, from this IDB to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:36| you have a pretty good assurance that it has been vetted to the hilt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| and that it comes with a great deal of due diligence with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6461)|
| 1:47:48| I don't know that that is at that point the district representation is as important as being able for you to rely on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:58| that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| Having said that, we can make nominations and we can find people who have skill sets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:06| You can find people who have skill sets that live north, south, east, and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| I'm not quarreling with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| With Commissioner Pinkston bringing two or more candidates per position makes a whole lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6494)|
| 1:48:21| But this is not a trivial appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| Well, you know, out of the four from Commissioner Moore, I know that Mr. Renfro is from the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:34| Commissioner Moore, do you know if any of the other three live within the fifth district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| So if we were to go from one set of four to the other set of four, I'd have one fifth replacing basically one for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6525)|
| 1:48:55| and the fifth district stays at one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| Not saying that that's what it should be, we deserve more or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| but I just think we need to make sure that we're doing very important boards like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| and like you've said, that we get a diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| And I don't know if we're going to need to vote on these as a block, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:19| or will we be doing them one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| But, you know, we've been on this for quite a while, and I don't know that we've gotten very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| And I think we need to, like Commissioner DeFree said, we need to open this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6571)|
| 1:49:38| It may be given another month, and I'm going to make a substitute motion to defer this until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| We already have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| I'd like to call for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| Vote on the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Mr. Chair, can I have a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| It's been suggested, and I don't know what the body of commissioners would like to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| that we either vote on them individually or as a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| And I'm not sure that the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| The motion was made in a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| If it was the will of the commissioners, I don't know how we would show it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| And I guess since it's already been called, we can have an amendment to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:20| Did you vote on the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| We voted on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| We voted on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| You got to vote on the call, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| We voted on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| The call was how many noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| We have a substitute motion on the floor to vote as a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| All four names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| Wait, wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| The motion is the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| State the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| State the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| Is the motion by Commissioner Moore, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| It's four names as read by Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| And one of them is here, Mr. Clem Renfrow, served in the banking business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| And he is a member of the chamber, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| So he's here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| If anybody would like to see him, wave your hand, Clem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| Is everyone straight on the motion, the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| We're voting for all four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6676)|

| 1:52:20| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6740)|

| 1:52:31| Nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| Ten no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| Nine yes and ten no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| As we've heard, this is extremely important appointments that we're going to be making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:53| In my first two years on commission, I didn't know a lot about IDB because it didn't come before us very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| The last two years, it's been before us a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| And as you correctly mentioned, it's because of the TIFs and it has really put the spotlight on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| I did not have a problem with any of the folks that Mr. Moore had brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| But I also know that, for example, Bud Gilbert has asked to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| Mr. Roger Goins has asked to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| I don't know Mr. Goins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| I do know Missy Wallen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:19| I've known her since college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| And she's literally risen through the ranks all the way to, I guess, working in the bank to being bank president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| And so she brings impressive credentials, as do the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| I would like to make a motion that we postpone this for 30 days, or a substitute motion that we postpone it 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6810)|
| 1:53:38| and that we ask the individuals who want to be considered to come to our committee meeting in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:44| and let us go through the process that we went through when we selected our colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| Let us hear from them, ask questions about their qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| because a couple of these people I don't know would like to get to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| but I feel like I can make a better informed vote by being able to talk with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| and ask them questions and just to get to know them, because I'm sure they're all fine individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| and all do a good job, but we can only select the number that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| So I'll make that in the form of a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:10| I have a friendly amendment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| Could we open this up to more folks than have just applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:17| I think anybody that wanted to be considered could come to the meeting that we're going to have to consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| and we have an opportunity to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| Is everyone clear on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| With no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| Mr. McKenzie, you may move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| That's the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| Motion passes 16-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| Go ahead, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| I've heard a lot of discussion on the appointment process and how good it was, and it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:07| It was a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| It cured what ailed the county commission at that time, in my humble opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6908)|
| 1:55:15| But I don't think we can apply that standard to every board, every commission, and it sounds like that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6915)|
| 1:55:22| At some point, we're going to have to ask the experts to give us recommendations and names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:28| and we take them at their word, or get rid of the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| And I'm not saying that to you, Mr. Edwards, in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| But at some point, they understand, and as Mr. Slater said, he understands how these people are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:43| He understands the dynamic and the path forward that we as a county have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:49| And for us to micromanage this all the way up until the July 15th deadline, which it sounds like that's what's happening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:56| So we're having special call meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| We're going to have a general all call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| Everybody come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| And, again, for some things, I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| But for the Industrial Development Board of Knox County, I think that's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| So that's why I voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| And I strongly urge the commissioners to understand the full ramifications of what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:19| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| Yes, in light of Commissioner Hammond's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| I would just like to recommend that we have some sort of deadline in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| that we have people who are interested in the position have their information to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| and also have that information to Mr. Edwards as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| so that he can review these folks, make sure that they are members of the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| and meet the certain skill sets and criteria that he would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| And then, but I don't know, a week or ten days prior to the intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:53| Making that in the form of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| And with a date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| Ten days prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| When are we meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| The 16th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| Yeah, before intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| Isn't that what you had said, Mr. Hammond, that intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| Would that mean then that we would have to meet together as a body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| Because I believe that Commissioner Pinkston has a resolution with regard to having finance meeting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:29| That was going before the rules committee, so we haven't, I don't think we voted on that, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| You all come up with a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| Sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| Are you talking about ten days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| Let's do ten business days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| Would that give you enough time, sir, to review any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| Oh, really, this coming Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart1?start=7078)|
