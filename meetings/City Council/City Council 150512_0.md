| 0:01:53| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| For the Mayor's Report, I want to start first by saying that we had a really great day here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| in Knoxville today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| We hosted the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Fox, who came to our Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| Planning Organization meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| We had a special gathering for him to come and to talk about the challenges of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| infrastructure throughout our country because of the piecemeal funding of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| from Congress over the last, I think, six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| There have been, what did he say, like 23 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=145)|
| 0:02:28| These numbers might not be quite right, but multiple short-term funding fixes, and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=148)|
| 0:02:36| they're really looking, the administration's really looking for a longer term, a long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| I think, six-year transportation bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| So he's going around Tennessee and other places in the country to talk about this is Infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| Week and there are a lot of mayors up in Washington, D.C. right now talking, or this week, talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| to Congress about this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| So as a way to highlight the importance of projects like Alcoa Highway, that's the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| we really focused on, and the fact that we all know the safety issues and the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| issues related with Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| And we've got, we're designing, we've got different segments of Alcoa from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| on through down to the airport that we are working on different stages, but we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=197)|
| 0:03:25| don't have enough money to do it or to finish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| So anyway, I encourage people to check into that and to talk to your elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| as you feel is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| Also, Anthony, Secretary Foxx, then joined us over at the Leadership Knoxville Annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| Mayor's Leadership Luncheon, and many of Council were there as well, were also at the TPO meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| And he spoke a little bit before he had to leave to the assembled 1,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| And Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson was our keynote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| Governor Haslam was there as well, and he received the award, the Lifetime Achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| or whatever they call it, but anyways, one of the outstanding citizen awards that Leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| Knoxville gives out each year, and he was there to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| So I think it was a really good opportunity for us to talk about city issues with two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| with a mayor and a former mayor, Anthony Foxx, the former mayor of Charlotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| And it was great to hear them and talk about what they do and then talk about our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| from their perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| So let's see, this week, this Thursday, May 14th, we have two events that will focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=270)|
| 0:04:37| disability services, disability issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| We are celebrating both the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| legislation, and the 30th anniversary of the Mayor's Council on Disability Issues, or CODI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| which is, of course, our local group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| There is a national ADA bus that is touring the country to highlight the federal act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| and it will be parked at Market Square all day on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| That's this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| And we will have an event there at 12 noon to celebrate the accomplishments of that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| So we invite everybody to come out on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| There will also be booths and displays with information from local disability resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| organizations and providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| And then later that day, 430, in the Square Room, there will be, on Market Square, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| will be a reception to celebrate everything that CODI has accomplished over the last 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| I think it was Mayor Testament, actually, which was the, who actually started it 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Great chance, that's a great chance for everybody to come out and to recognize all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| who have served on that council over the years, and this has been a great resource for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| of us and for previous mayors and councils as we make sure that Knoxville is truly an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| accessible and a welcoming city to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| So I want to thank Stephanie Brewer-Cook, the city's ADA coordinator, and the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| of CODI for helping pull all of this together, so I hope you all will join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| Other than that, I know we're all looking forward to council's budget hearings, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| I guess are next week, someone might be announcing that, and city staff, of course, will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| to talk about the proposed budget and answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| And I hope everyone has a great Memorial Day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Now before we move on to council reports, we have a report from MPC, from Kay Graybiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| It's the annual Historic Preservation Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| So I'll call on Kay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| Good evening, Mayor and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| I'm Kay Graybiel, Historic Preservation Planner with MPC, and I just wanted to go over briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| some of the highlights from the Preservation 2014 Report for that 2014 calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=405)|
| 0:06:54| Some of the initiatives that have been implemented over the past year were, there's a new City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| Historic Preservation Fund initiated by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| I believe those grants have been awarded, or the nominees have been, the awardees have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| been chosen for those, so that is funded at $500,000, so that's a great new initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=431)|
| 0:07:19| Demolition by Neglect Ordinance, that continues to be funded and implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| The first implementation of it was with Knoxville, South Knoxville High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| The Tennessee Historical Commission Grant was awarded to MPC to update the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| resource inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| That inventory can now include mid-century buildings that were previously not surveyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=464)|
| 0:07:53| so that we can capture that mid-century modern historic structures, as well as it will help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| us to digitize and update the existing survey that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| Historic Overlay Code Enforcement, that has been tracked more carefully with a database| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| and there is an assigned building inspector that will work with Historic Overlay to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| resolve those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| Again, a grant from the Tennessee Historical Commission was awarded a couple years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| and we're working on the update of the design guidelines with that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| Tonight, we'll hear the Demolition Delay Ordinance Proposal and decide whether that's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| tool that the City of Knoxville would like to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| Just some recommendations for next year, or things to work on over the next couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| years would be to actually implement that Historic Preservation Fund Grant from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| Tennessee Historical Commission and the City of Knoxville to update our historic resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| We also would like to, the Historic Zoning Commission neighborhoods have given input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| that they would like to see the Demolition by Neglect Funds possibly used on some residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| structures within the neighborhoods, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| We'll be implementing, hopefully, the new Demolition Delay Ordinance over this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| if we all agree this is a tool that we want to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| The actions that are already in progress are the ones I just mentioned about the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| guidelines update and the designated building inspectors responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=576)|
| 0:09:44| So, there are several categories of activities with historic buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| I'll just show you quickly, this is the design guidelines update excerpt just to show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| some examples of what some of those illustrations may look like to help citizens, developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=597)|
| 0:10:04| investors, staff, Historic Zoning Commission, everyone to understand more what the concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| are and what the desired outcomes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| We had quite a number of adaptive reuse projects going on over the past couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| Of course, the White Lily Building, Patrick Sullivan's Knoxville High School, Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| Mental Health Institute, Slomsky-Taylor Building, Southern Railway Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| So those are some great examples of some buildings being adaptively reused right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| And so those we would count among our success stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| We do have some properties that have great potential for that, for adaptive reuse, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| are currently threatened, they're currently kind of in a state of limbo, hoping for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| preservation solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Those include the Christenberry House, the Prior Brown Parking Garage, the 1300 block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| of White Avenue Houses, the Pickle Mansion on Clinch Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| We lost some buildings, sadly, in the demolition category, or the destroyed by fire is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| case with the McClung Warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| This is the before and this is the during, during the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| Also, Sofronia Strong Hall is a partial preservation, demolition of the majority of it on the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=672)|
| 0:11:20| of Tennessee campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Some might count it as a success, some may count it as a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| And then we had a National Register nomination for the Winstead Cottage, Confederate Cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| and Confederate Monument on Winstead Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| So that pretty much summarizes some of the things highlighted in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| I'd be happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Thank you, Kaye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Are there any questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Is your question related to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| Councilman Delevaux?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| I wonder if you could tell us, are you looking at any use or reuse of rural high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| It sits there deteriorating over time and it's a big old grand building with a nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| ball field and recreation area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Is there any hope that that's going to be brought under your wing and converted to something useful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| Well, I know that Knox Heritage has conducted some tours of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| I believe some of our local developers have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| I have to say I haven't heard of any activity recently on that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| Some of you may know a little more about that than I do, but it is definitely in that category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| of older schools that we love to see adaptively reused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| We've seen some great examples of that here lately with Oakwood School and the Giffen School, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| I think that school has potential as well, but we at MPC aren't currently working on any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=763)|
| 0:12:51| It doesn't really fall under our bailiwick to market that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| We certainly would love to do anything we can do to support its adaptive reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| You hate to see something like that deteriorate further and then it becomes almost impossible financially to get something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=782)|
| 0:13:10| That is the demolition by neglect ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| That's what it's designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| If it could possibly be funded with enough money to handle all the buildings that deserve this kind of attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=796)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Any other questions for Kay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| I would like to say it's National Historic Preservation Month for the month of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| and Knox Heritage has several activities going on over the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| You can go to their website at knoxheritage.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| I do have them listed here, but just coming up, I can go over them briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| May 15th is a Fragile 15 announcement at Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| Lost and Found Luncheon on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| Poets for Preservation on May 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| Bridal Fair on May 19th, and that's at Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| Preservation Libations at the Crown and Goose on the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| And on June 5th is the Art and Architecture Tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| This time it is called the Cripple Creek Crawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| We can provide you with an email with all these dates in it, and they're also on the Knox Heritage website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=850)|
| 0:14:18| Yes, please do email them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Email all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Thank you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| I think it's always good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| I mean, it's required, but it's also welcome to see this each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| that we have this preservation report to remind us what we have accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| which we have several accomplishments this year with the Historic Preservation Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| and continuing to fund and to use the funds for the Demolition by Neglect Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| and the other things that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Of course, the item that's on the agenda today, the Demolition Delay Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| But as you said, there are still some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| And so thank you for documenting all of that and reminding us annually of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| So now we're on to committee reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| I'd just like to announce the app for Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| The mayor and I visited with their monthly Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association meeting last Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=912)|
| 0:15:19| and they had a real good, large crowd there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| So we got to hear about their concerns and their successes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| And they had the announcement of the app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| And, of course, everybody knows how to get an app, but it's the Cumberland Connect app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| And then they've also got a website, CumberlandConnect.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| And it has various things like coupons, updates on the actual construction going on, events, Facebook, Twitter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| how to contact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| It's got everything in the world that you'll want to know about the construction going on on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=948)|
| 0:15:56| Just want to remind everybody that Cumberland Avenue is open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| We've got two free parking lots that we can use from 5 p.m. to 6 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| One of them is at 19 and Clinch, the surface lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| It's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| So, please, it's easy to get to, and it's easy to walk around, you know, once you get down on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| and then UT Federal Credit Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| The exact address escapes me, but it's the 2200 White Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| I'll write that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| There's free parking there, too, from 5 p.m. to 6 a.m. as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| So, enjoy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| The mayor alluded to we do have our council budget hearings next Thursday in this room, the 21st of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| beginning at 8.30, and we'll conclude at 5 with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| So, it's obviously open to the public, and we welcome everyone to come listen and speak to us at public forum if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1009)|
| 0:16:58| And lastly, the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club, we all know the great work that they've done in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| and the county as well, and they are a finalist for a $100,000 grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| And I would urge you, one of the ways that they can win this grant is whoever gets the most votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| So, with that in mind, pen in hand, go to downtowndownhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| That's the website that you can go to and vote for them to let them win this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1044)|
| 0:17:33| Obviously, it would be real important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| They want to open a kind of a super bike area where the Wood family so generously donated 100 acres of land to the urban wilderness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| about 18 months ago or two years, however long it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| But just being a finalist of this is really great, and let's get them to the winner's circle on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1068)|
| 0:17:56| So, that's what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Oh, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| I'd like to add to what Vice Mayor Pavlis had to say about Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| My wife and I have been down there several times for dinner, and we've met folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| and it is not a problem to get to and it's not a problem to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| So I would encourage all of you to help those merchants and spread the word that we can get there on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| The other thing I wanted to do, the mayor did not mention the fact that for the first time, I think in almost, what, 17 years, 16 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| the Women's Political Collaboration Leadership had their luncheon here, and our mayor was honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| And, Mayor, we want to congratulate you for that honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| It's the first time, so congratulations on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| I wanted to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| And then the other thing, maybe on a little bit more serious note, today we had the memorial ceremony for the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| The police, as all of us know, in the last few weeks, not so much our police in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| but police across the United States, you might say, have been getting what I consider sometimes a bum rap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| And today we had this ceremony for the police who have lost their lives or who have died this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| and it was really a moving service, and it was one that a number of city council, the mayor was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| a number of elected officials were there, and I think it was a very moving, very memorable kind of event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| and I'm glad that we were able to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| I know it's something that's done nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| And along those lines, many of you are aware that Stephanie Fairbanks was killed on the Third Creek Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1159)|
| 0:19:30| and there was a vigil for her last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| And both Finbar Saunders and myself and Joe Armstrong, we were late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| We didn't actually make the ceremony, but we were able to get there afterwards, and we met with the relatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| Dan Brown came, and I know, Mayor, you were there earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| And two of the aunts that we met with wanted us to be sure to pass the word about how well they've been treated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| not only by the citizens of Knoxville, but they had nothing but good words to say about the police and our police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| They've been kept informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| They really feel that the police have really been working on this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| and they just wanted to be sure to pass the word on that they really felt that the Knoxville police were just top in what they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1206)|
| 0:20:15| So, Chief, we wanted to pass that word on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| In fact, the one aunt said, you know, she said, I live up in, I think it was West Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| She said, you know, I think I'm going to move to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| She said, the people here are so gracious and kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| And she said, and I know, it's a safe city to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| It was just one of those unfortunate events that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| Mother's Day, we, my family, all of my family, ended up on the Third Creek bikeway, bicycling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| and our new center reporter was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| We passed her on the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| So, folks, the greenways are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| They're used, and they were very, very crowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| And I want to encourage people to continue to use that this was just a random act that was unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| So, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| On that note, I did attend the candlelight vigil, and I noticed that people were bicycling, walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| So, people are still encouraged to continue what they have ordinarily been doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| even though we had that very tragic accident, or not accident, but tragic thing to happen to that young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1272)|
| 0:21:20| I wanted to announce on May 26th at 3 p.m., since we've been talking about history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| the Tennessee Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| We will be installing a historical marker that has been approved by the Tennessee Historical Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| and that marker will be placed at the former location of Warner Tabernacle AME Zion Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1299)|
| 0:21:47| which is the oldest African American church in the city, founded in 1845.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| And it was reportedly to be a station on the Underground Railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| and the first school for African Americans in East Knoxville was in its basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1319)|
| 0:22:07| So, that will be on May 26th at 3 p.m., and Fuller Street is about two blocks from Five Points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1327)|
| 0:22:17| It's almost across the street from the residence at Eastport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| So, it's a narrow street, and parking will be limited, but we'll hopefully work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| And so, I wanted to extend an invitation to everyone to come and attend this brief ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1354)|

| 0:25:05| Yes, I respectfully submit that no revisions can be made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1505)|

| 0:25:43| Jim York is here. We can ask him, or perhaps you can just shout it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| As I understand it, the tax rate of $2.73 is actually some finer breakdown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1547)|

| 0:26:08| Okay, anything else, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1568)|

| 0:27:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| I think that Dan Kelly is here. I don't know if Jeff is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| There are sort of four categories of building or building types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| Maybe you could tell us the different ones that relate to the National Register versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| the age, like before the Civil War, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Tell us how this works in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Well, the ordinance basically has four classes of property, if you want to think of it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| Dan Kelly and PC Stan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| Those that are on the National Register, those that are in the already designated historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| districts that have the H-1 zoning district on them, those that are on the federal that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| are already listed on the Federal Register, and then those that are eligible to be listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| on the Federal Register but not yet listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| And finally, the last group are properties which are deemed to be locally historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| significant and haven't been designated in any form as yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| Part of that has to do with the fact that the last historic survey was done in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1696)|
| 0:28:26| and some of the information may be out of date now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| So it gives Ms. Graybeal the opportunity to weigh in on other properties which do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| have the mantle of being on the Register or Register eligible to determine whether they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| are locally historically significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Basically what the ordinance does is generate a 60-day cooling off period in which the preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| community would have an opportunity to deal with the property owners, to seek alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| to demolition such as preservation, restoration, or potentially even the sale of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1736)|
| 0:29:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| In addition to that, that fourth category, locally significant, that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| MPC is working on with Ms. Graybeal to come up with a list of properties that might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| identified as being significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Is that what we heard earlier from her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| That list would more or less be created as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| As properties come in, there would be an assessment of their significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| There is a grouping of properties that we already know are at least eligible for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| we consider locally significant, whether they're considered to be National Register or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| But we would add to that list as needed as properties were presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| And there is a provision in the code that says that we would notify property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| as we added those to the list of locally significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| So they would be informed and could participate in whatever process you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Yes, they would be informed and they would participate as much as they felt the need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| They wouldn't be required to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| Of those four categories, the ones that are the pre-Civil War, Mr. Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| are they treated differently somehow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| Or maybe it's Ms. Graybeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| The pre-1865 property delay is actually just a formal adoption into our code of a Tennessee state code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1830)|
| 0:30:43| that's already on the books that we can be implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| It's actually mandated by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| So we could be implementing it whether it's in our code or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| But we want to officially adopt it into our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| The county has already adopted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| And so that includes a 60-day delay as well for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Yes, Ms. Graybeal, I guess I'll direct my question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| In our packet on page 95, there's a list of City of Knoxville historic structures inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1874)|
| 0:31:24| One thing listed is Knoxville College Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| Does that include just the campus itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| Or does that include some surroundings outside of the campus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| Can you tell me about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| They're facing a great difficulty right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| I'm curious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| That is a National Register Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| And it basically includes the college campus, the historic resources on the campus itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1911)|
| 0:31:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| So the campus only does not include anything outside around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| There's some historic buildings on that campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| It's just the institutional buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| I don't believe it includes staff residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| It's just the institutional buildings of the campus itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| So it doesn't extend out into a neighborhood or anything in the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| This question came to me this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| Who is the demolition permit issued to and is it transferable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1950)|
| 0:32:40| Could you repeat the first part of the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Who is the demolition permit issued to and is it transferable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| It runs with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| It's issued to an applicant, whether it's an owner's agent or the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| And is it transferable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| It runs with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| So it is transferable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| We would presume that it is, but you might want to direct that question to the codes office, to Peter Ahrens or his group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| That was the question that came to me, that with a 60-day delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| so would they be subject to two 60-day delays if that were the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| It came to me late this afternoon, so I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Our basic thought is that the 60-day delay is exactly what it says it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| It's an opportunity for those who are interested in getting involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| and the preservation of particular structures can get involved at the end of the 60-day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2026)|
| 0:33:54| I don't know that we're going to be able to prevent buildings from being demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| if they're eligible to be demolished otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Mayor Brown, did you have another question or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2052)|

| 0:34:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| 12F is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| Article 2 definitions, Article 4, Section 5.1, Historic Overlay District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| Article 4, Section 5.2, NC1 Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| and Article 5, Supplementary Regulations Applying to a Specific, to Several, or to All Districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| related to TCA Section 7-51-1201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2081)|

| 0:34:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| 12G is an ordinance adopting the 2015 Northwest City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| which amends the previously adopted 2003 Northwest City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| and the General Plan 2033, Council Districts 2, 3, 5, and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2095)|
| 0:35:04| Okay, so we have three people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| Councilman Grief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Did the amendment that we got, is it included in this now or do we have to add that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| It would have to be amended to include that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Okay, so we want to hear it first or do we want to amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| So if you want to make a motion on this and then we can have discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| and then you can make an amendment if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| We'll start with a motion and a second on this to get it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| Okay, I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| No second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| Okay, so we have a motion and a second on the Northwest City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| So now let's hear from, anybody want to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| We'll hear from the three that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Can we go ahead and amend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Well, if you want to, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| We'll go ahead and amend according to what was sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Okay, so do we need to state that any differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| It should be a little more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| Yeah, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| She has it written there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Right, which is basically tweaking some language related to how Plan E.T. is described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| And the extra statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| And it also includes the extra statement that was submitted by Mr. Redman that I forwarded to you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Okay, and that's the full extent of those amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Everyone's clear on what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| You've seen those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| So we have that amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Okay, so now we'll hear from the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| Do we want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| Vote, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Okay, let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| So, yeah, we'll go ahead and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Talk about it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Well, let's let them speak and then we'll vote, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| I've got the language here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| Someone had copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Okay, so Mr. Redman, then Carlene Malone, and then Larry Silversingh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| And you all know the drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| I'm going to set the timer and we're happy you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| Okay, Mayor Rojero, members of City Council, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| My name is Len Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| I live at 5246 Oak Hill Lane in the Norwood community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| which is accidentally in the Northwest City sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| I am here to urge your support for the amendment that you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| I think it does a couple of good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| It separates the Plan E.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| while still giving recognition for the efforts that the planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| and folks have put into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| but it makes it very clear the distinction between it and other regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| I'd like to thank Mayor Rojero and members of her administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| for the hard work they've put in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I'd like to thank MPC staff who, beyond this week, for many weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| have struggled with this and have improved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| especially Dan Kelly with his revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| That has made a really good document out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| I'd like to thank the neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| and I'd just like to urge you to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Thank you, Len.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Ms. Malone, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| Thank you, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I'm here on behalf of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| First of all, thank you, everyone, for getting us where I hope we are tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| It's been a trip, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| Our goal from the very beginning has been to avoid any confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| regarding which plans are part of the legally mandated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| and legally binding comprehensive plans that control land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| Through the adoption process of MPC and City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| the comprehensive plans are vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| There can be no ambiguity that the objectives of the adopted general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| are then implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| The proposed additional language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| and the reorganization of the Northwest City Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| make it clear that the comprehensive plans do not include Plan A-T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2327)|

| 0:39:07| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| I am here tonight as a member of Community Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| an organization with representatives from many neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| in the city of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| I am also here as a resident in the Northwest City Sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| For many months, Community Forum and many of its members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| have participated in the process of reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| the proposed Northwest City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| We have attended the MPC neighborhood meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| submitted letters to MPC with comments about the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| appeared and spoke at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| communicated with other neighborhood groups and individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| and communicated with City Council members and the city administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| Community Forum has been leading the way for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| in suggesting and promoting needed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| to improve the planning process in Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| and will continue to do so in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| We appreciate the support from the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| and from Knox County in our endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| We have expressed our concerns to you about some of the content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| in the proposed Northwest City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| As drafted, we believed there were potential problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| with unintended consequences and unnecessary confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| We are pleased that a compromise has been crafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| which we believe specifically and clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| addresses our primary concerns and which will make clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| that, quote, Plan ET and its products are not part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| or incorporated into the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| and its sector plans, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| We appreciate the efforts of all those who were involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| in working with us to achieve this result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| I just, for clarification, just wanted to read the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| into what I believe is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| I believe it's Plan ET and its products are not part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| or incorporated into the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| and its sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| Is that the motion, Mr. Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Does it not also include, or no, the other tweaking of language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| that you showed me, Dan, is that already in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| It's already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| So we just need to add this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Just for people watching at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| There's been a lot of emailing and contact about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| and we've heard the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| Just so it's clear, I think the concern was in part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| just the formatting of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| There was a discussion of something under the heading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| and it had incorporated the Plan ET in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| And, of course, there's nothing wrong with our planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| working with other counties, finding out what other folks are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| trying to coordinate efforts so that we all end up in a decent place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| in terms of working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| The concern was, and I think at least one of the speakers mentioned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| is that we do have a process by our charter and our ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| and state law that have certain elements that are sort of the bedrock plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| that all zoning and land use changes and decisions must conform to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| By putting Plan ET in that segment of the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| it left confusion even with the additional language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| And I think everyone here is grateful that we have now physically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| exerted that paragraph or so about Plan ET| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| and moved it to the end of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| so that it stands alone as identifying this useful document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| and useful process to help us move forward as we manage our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| but making clear to some distant court or body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| that would be confronted with a challenge about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| as to what is or is not the standard that has to be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| to make sure that zoning decisions and land use decisions are proper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| that they have the oversight of the general plan, the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| the one-year plans, the things that have been, as someone said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| vetted before the community both in public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| and vetted before this council, which adopts ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| And so by moving it and by putting the disclaimer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| I think we're in a position at least now to know that we don't set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| inadvertently confusion about what are the governing tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| that we have to look at to construe our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| And maybe that's a little arcane to most people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| but when it comes down to battles over zoning and issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| and they do occur every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| people have to go back to the core documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| and they have to compare the standards that are laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| with what was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| And so I think it's wise for this community and this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| to have a clear path to evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| And I appreciate the effort that your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| and Mr. Kelly's office have done in trying to sort of get it back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| Now, we have had comments, and I still have received comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| saying they would rather see this language totally excised from the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| I understand we are not there at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| I'm going, I think, with the will of the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| that as long as we can clarify the path that we're setting down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| that we're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| And so I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| But I think it's important to realize that we're trying to keep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| as one of the speakers said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| a pretty clear vision of what are our controlling documents mandated by law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| publicly vetted, and adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| And I appreciate the effort that went into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| I would just like to state, though, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| that our attorneys and the MPC attorney felt very comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| with the document as it came to MPC and to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| They felt it was perfectly defensible and clear to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| in having to defend it in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| But because there were concerns from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| and they sought that kind of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| then, you know, MPC offered up some language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| and we appreciated when Mr. Redman, on behalf of his group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| actually added some more so that we could come to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| where everybody felt more comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| But I just want to say, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| the attorneys were quite comfortable with it as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| Was somebody else? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| All right, so we have this amendment, so let's vote first on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| Oh, wait a minute, Dan, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Well, very briefly, Dan Kelly, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| As a staff, we would like to think what you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| is adding clarification to the plan, not actually amending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| You're clarifying the action that the Planning Commission took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| in adopting the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| And secondly, the attaboys need to go to Jeff Archer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| He's the planner that's done all the work, not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| So Jeff's the guy that needs the pat on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Appreciate that, and thank you, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Okay, so first we're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Any opposed? That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| And now on the original ordinance as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Any opposed? Ayes have it, and that passes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| Thank you all. We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| 12H is an ordinance approving the request of Harrison Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| for an amendment to the East City Sector Plan from light industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| to heavy industrial for property located on the north side of Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil150512?start=2824)|
