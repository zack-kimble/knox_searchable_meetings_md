| 2:21:45| Madam Chancellor, you know, we have a sector plan that has a little piece of what's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8505)|
| 2:21:53| the city limits and a piece of what's in the urban growth boundary where we can expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| to, and that does not include the Midway Park, although as you described, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8519)|
| 2:22:04| it does include that bit of acreage right around the interchange that was one time annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8524)|
| 2:22:09| annexed, I guess, during the Ashe administration for possible use of billboards or other business-type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8529)|
| 2:22:15| activity. I think if you talk to the council members, you would find us all torn. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8535)|
| 2:22:25| has been a lot of work that your staff put into this thing, and among other things, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8545)|
| 2:22:31| French Broad corridor preservation overlay is certainly a wonderful choice in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8551)|
| 2:22:38| protecting what is precious to the community. The Midway Park thing brings a lot of controversy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8558)|
| 2:22:44| with it, and we're going to hear about some of that now. And I must say that we are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8564)|
| 2:22:48| torn because jobs are important to this community. They're important to the growth of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| as we heard during the budget debate. On the other hand, preservation of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8574)|
| 2:23:00| and a way of life is also at stake here. We may not be, based on your answer and Mr. Swanson's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8580)|
| 2:23:07| even going to be acting on that piece of it, but I know that people up here have wrestled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8587)|
| 2:23:12| with it, and we don't take it lightly. I just want to state that, and I want to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| from the people in the audience, because I think that they've spent a lot of time studying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| this issue on both sides of it, in the chamber and the development corp, as well as the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8600)|
| 2:23:26| residents. There is a very tough, tough decision that has to be made about that park, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| may not be approached tonight, but I just want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8613)|
| 2:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8617)|
| 2:23:37| Turn my old light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8617)|
| 2:23:38| Okay. I'm going to go ahead and call on the speakers as they're, if you want to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| a different order, but they're, I'm going to call on, Bob, I'm sorry, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| Mr. Donaldson, how many acres for the city purpose are we talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8628)|
| 2:23:55| It's a number slightly less than 2,000 acres. I think it was 1,700 and some. Out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8635)|
| 2:24:02| East County Sector Plan, it's roughly 40,000 acres. So, less than 5% of the total land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8642)|
| 2:24:10| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| All right. Thank you. Ms. Palmer, did you have a light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8651)|
| 2:24:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| Okay. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and call on the speakers in this order, but if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8658)|
| 2:24:23| want to come in a different order, you can. Bob Wolfenbarger, then Lisa Starbuck, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| then David Boot. And I am going to remind you what was just said. We're only speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| to the part that's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| I'm Bob Wolfenbarger, and my address is 3200 Lexan Lane. And I would like a chance, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8673)|
| 2:24:43| I may, after I read this statement, to respond to Mr. Bailey's question. Of course, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8683)|
| 2:24:49| I'd like you to rephrase it to me, but, Mayor, Council Members, I sincerely want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8689)|
| 2:24:57| all the Council Members for the effort and the time that you've taken to spend with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8697)|
| 2:25:03| me personally and to spend with others in the community to talk about this issue. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8703)|
| 2:25:09| know it's not taken lightly. We take you seriously, and we greatly respect the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8709)|
| 2:25:16| that you've invested with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| If I may read this, I'll do better. As you all know, I don't speak freehand very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8718)|
| 2:25:23| As an advocate and resident who has lived in East Knox County and a participant in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8723)|
| 2:25:28| the East Knox County Sector Plan, I have expressed many concerns. As you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| residents of Thorn Grove believe the MPC and the TDC have misrepresented to this body many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8733)|
| 2:25:41| of the facts as they relate to the proposed industrial site, and that the TDC has grossly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| exaggerated the potential of the site to be in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| I mean, only the stuff that's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8750)|
| 2:25:53| I'm referring to, because, maybe I should address Mr. Batty's question. There's 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8753)|
| 2:26:01| acres directly across the street from this site that's in the city, and there may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8761)|
| 2:26:09| that rare occasion where the sun can shine on one side of the street and not on the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| but what happens at Midway Road on the proposed industrial site is going to control what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8772)|
| 2:26:18| around it, and that's our position. Hopefully that addresses his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8778)|
| 2:26:27| I have yet, and I've asked this question at the workshop and other places. No one on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8787)|
| 2:26:33| the council has been able, or has at least addressed it, but maybe they're able to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8793)|
| 2:26:39| me why and how they're going to control urban sprawl around the site. We believe in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8799)|
| 2:26:48| community, and as I was getting to in the statement, if I may continue to read it, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8808)|
| 2:26:55| Midway Road industrial park, business park, whatever it is, will be the initiation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8815)|
| 2:27:04| a process of urban sprawl for the entire East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8824)|
| 2:27:11| We can't address what's in the city without considering, for example, Mr. Donaldson suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8831)|
| 2:27:17| that there's 17,000 acres, and this is less than, 1,700, excuse me, and this is less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8837)|
| 2:27:24| one person, what did you say? Less than 5% of the entire sector, yet it is the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8844)|
| 2:27:32| it is the gateway to, because it's Midway Road interchange, it's the gateway to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8852)|
| 2:27:39| rest of that 1,700, 17,000 acres, and that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8859)|
| 2:27:48| What happens there impacts everything else. I guess, Mr. Swanson, you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| to help me here, because I don't, I mean, I guess theoretically anything could then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| impact something that happens in the city, so I don't, I'm not quite certain how to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8876)|
| 2:28:04| I'd like just to read my statement, if I may, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| It does matter, I mean, we already said we're going to talk about what applies to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| so I'm not trying to cut you off, but I think it does matter that we talk about what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| can talk about, so I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8895)|
| 2:28:19| It seems to me that he is trying to make a connection between that part of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8899)|
| 2:28:26| that's located in the city and that part that's not located in the city, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8906)|
| 2:28:32| it's really up to the council members to decide whether or not that connection is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| Mr. Mayor, I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8916)|
| 2:28:37| If you think it's completely out of the realm of relevance, then you as presiding officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8917)|
| 2:28:42| could rule it out, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| As the representative of the 4th district in which sector is affected here, I certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8924)|
| 2:28:49| think that these people have been here several times waiting to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| It's both been postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| One time, at my fault, I was out of town, and I certainly think in Defferson, we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8935)|
| 2:28:59| just hear what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| It may be that this body does not reach some of the questions they're talking to, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| think both they and the chamber have something that they want to tell us, and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8945)|
| 2:29:09| Anybody on council feel differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8951)|
| 2:29:14| Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8954)|
| 2:29:15| You know, just about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| When I first came on council, it became crystal clear to me that you'll hear a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| but only certain...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| We're here to decide upon only a certain number of things, and Mr. DellaVolpe, we've had several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8963)|
| 2:29:31| hearings and, I mean, I heard a lot of questions from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| We've beat the tar out of it, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| Oh, yeah, and I've cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| I mean, I'm not for urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| I love farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| I was astonished ten years ago when I came back here what's happened to our countryside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8985)|
| 2:29:51| and I hear a lot of my colleagues concerned about the perception of what the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8991)|
| 2:29:57| is here to decide on, and we ought to just focus directly on those legitimate issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| that we're here to decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9002)|
| 2:30:03| That's my point, and I'm not trying to get anybody off the hook or find a way out, pros| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9003)|
| 2:30:09| or cons or whatever, but, I mean, I've heard it, and I respect your work, Bob, and, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9009)|
| 2:30:19| know, everyone else's, but there's only certain things that I've tried to focus on that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| here as a body, and it's our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| Thank you, Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9030)|
| 2:30:33| I'll make a motion that we suspend the rules so he can read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| I mean, we've been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9036)|
| 2:30:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| If that's how council feels and I'm seeing more yeses than noes, I'm just going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9039)|
| 2:30:43| ahead as the moderator and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| I would ask you as much as possible only deal with the city and remember the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| Hopefully, I can get through this in about three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| Let's see, where was I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9052)|
| 2:30:59| I'll skip that last statement about the Development Corporation grossly exaggerating the jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9059)|
| 2:31:03| and the potential, but also known as an overwhelming majority of participants in the East County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| Sector Plan that believe the sector plan to be at least flawed, or if not corrupted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9069)|
| 2:31:16| and that applies to what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9076)|
| 2:31:19| We don't believe that the sector plan process was normal, as in the five previous ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9079)|
| 2:31:26| I've done and the two previous East County Sector Plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9086)|
| 2:31:30| We believe the 2000 East County Sector Plan process to have been a vehicle driven by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9090)|
| 2:31:35| the MPC solely to deliver an industrial proposal for the TDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| The end does not justify the means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| Some would argue that we should move forward with the sector plan because of all the good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| concepts that don't include Midway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| We would submit that these concepts already exist in the 2000 Sector Plan and have never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9111)|
| 2:31:56| been acted upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| Further, there is no ordinance that gives any of these concepts teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9118)|
| 2:32:02| Most of the development tools in reference to in the plan do not exist, and to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9122)|
| 2:32:07| that the development guidelines or tools do exist, they are not specific to this sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9127)|
| 2:32:12| plan and it's at your all's discretion to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9132)|
| 2:32:16| Speaking from the perspective of a Knoxville homeowner and a Knoxville neighborhood advocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| I believe that there is a critical need to direct and visually redirect private and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| public development investment to the core of the neighborhoods, to core neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9146)|
| 2:32:31| that have existing infrastructure and for many decades have deferred maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| These neighborhoods have paid their dues, their taxes, and are already paid for, already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9156)|
| 2:32:41| paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9161)|
| 2:32:42| Further, all investment these core neighborhoods will have, all investment in these core neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9162)|
| 2:32:51| will have an immediate and net impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| Conversely, all greenfield spending, at best, is just an initial and small down payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9173)|
| 2:32:59| toward future unfunded mandates for future and long-term forms of public debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9179)|
| 2:33:10| All private and public commercial industrial dollars that are spent at Midway Road will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9190)|
| 2:33:14| not be invested in the core neighborhoods of the city like Aliceville or Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| Furthermore, any subsequent business activities generated at Midway will compete with existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9199)|
| 2:33:25| businesses in East Knoxville and further disinvestment in our urban neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9205)|
| 2:33:31| While you all know this, I am concerned that you may be distracted by the unfounded claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| of the TDC and I am hopeful that this council will be an advocate for the environment, sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9215)|
| 2:33:42| development and physical responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| We believe council should reject the MPC and TDC's behavior with regard to the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9224)|
| 2:33:50| and clearly affirm a public participation, openness and transparency as a policy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9230)|
| 2:33:59| the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| We ask that you do not condone the actions of the MPC and the TDC and that you do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| encourage or support urban sprawl that this plan will promote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| Therefore, we ask you to reject the process, the proposed industrial park and this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9250)|
| 2:34:17| And once again, I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| I do appreciate all the effort and time that you've invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9263)|
| 2:34:24| Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9264)|
| 2:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| My name is Lisa Starbuck and I live at 6233 Babeley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9266)|
| 2:34:33| And in view of the hour, I'm certainly going to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9273)|
| 2:34:37| With regard to how this relates to the city plan, I would submit to you that you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9277)|
| 2:34:42| being asked, if you read the resolution, it doesn't say a motion to approve the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9282)|
| 2:34:48| portion of the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| It says a motion to approve the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| Furthermore...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9294)|
| 2:34:55| We're going to tackle that as we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9299)|
| 2:35:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9300)|
| 2:35:01| With regard to the workshop that was held, the city workshop, again, we discussed all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9301)|
| 2:35:10| of the concepts in the sector plan, so I think that is somewhat relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9310)|
| 2:35:14| I have prepared a PowerPoint and I'm going to go through it very quickly, unless someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9314)|
| 2:35:23| has questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| There's been a lot of talk about all of the misinformation flying around about the East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| County Sector Plan and how the East County Sector Plan was created and also what things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9330)|
| 2:35:36| are contained in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| And I will have to say that at the city council workshop, I provided some incorrect information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9339)|
| 2:35:45| when I told you that the proposed industrial park was, in fact, inside the urban growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9345)|
| 2:35:53| boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9353)|
| 2:35:54| And I wanted to clarify for you why I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9354)|
| 2:35:58| Before you, you have a map, and encircled in red is the area at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9358)|
| 2:36:04| And what this map is, is it was used during the 2000 Sector Plan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9364)|
| 2:36:10| And it shows that it was approved by the Growth Coordinating Committee in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| However, by the time that this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| You'll notice that the Midway Road property is, in fact, inside the urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9378)|
| 2:36:23| on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9383)|
| 2:36:24| That's the blue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| That's the blue area, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| And so what happened somehow between 2000 and 2001 when council adopted the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9388)|
| 2:36:35| policy is that property somehow got moved out of the city's urban growth boundary and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9395)|
| 2:36:41| into the county's urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| So I just wanted to make sure that you all knew that I wasn't making it up or just relying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9403)|
| 2:36:49| on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9409)|
| 2:36:50| I was relying on a map that had been adopted by the Growth Coordinating Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9410)|
| 2:37:00| Also at that workshop, the Development Corporation and also Mr. Bill Elmore stated that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9420)|
| 2:37:08| were all utilities except for sewer available at the site, when, in fact, the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9428)|
| 2:37:13| knew that there was no gas service at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| And this is an email from Mr. Elmore stating that he misspoke that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9435)|
| 2:37:33| The reason we're doing this presentation is that the Development Corporation took our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9453)|
| 2:37:37| talking points that I gave you at the workshop and they rebutted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9457)|
| 2:37:41| I'm not sure that they provided you with that information, but they did provide it to County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9461)|
| 2:37:45| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9465)|
| 2:37:46| They may not have provided it to you because we did a counter-rebuttal and showed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| there were several misstatements in that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9471)|
| 2:37:58| The first one that I would like to cover is that the Development Corporation stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9478)|
| 2:38:09| we were saying things that were not true, specifically that the property had never been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9489)|
| 2:38:14| marketed for sale as a business location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| However, we have a Knoxville News Sentinel article that's dated June of 2005 that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9496)|
| 2:38:23| that it was, in fact, marketed as a business property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9503)|
| 2:38:29| That's the Sturkey property that they ended up giving to Knoxville Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9509)|
| 2:38:34| The next issue, and I think this is a very important issue because it was also brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9514)|
| 2:38:38| up at the City Council workshop where they made the assertions that the property was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| mostly level, that there was a very little slope problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| And actually, as it turns out, you know, the Development Corporation said that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9527)|
| 2:38:55| wrong about the slope, that the vast majority of this site is relatively flat with a slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9535)|
| 2:39:00| of less than 6%, however, an analysis by the MPC shows that only 25% of the site is less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9540)|
| 2:39:10| than, 25% is less than 6% slope, so that's not hardly a vast majority of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9550)|
| 2:39:21| The next slide is the slope that shows, is applied to their, all these things that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9561)|
| 2:39:28| see in red, those are big 25% slopes that are, that lead into sinkholes, they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9568)|
| 2:39:35| be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| So the assertion by the Development Corporation that this is all, you know, a big, going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9577)|
| 2:39:42| to be a big property for them, that they can somehow provide contiguous acreage to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9582)|
| 2:39:46| somebody big that wants to come here, it's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9586)|
| 2:39:51| One more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9591)|
| 2:39:52| One of the reasons that the community has been so very concerned about this issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9592)|
| 2:40:00| that a lot of, they acknowledge that there's a number of sinkholes, in fact, I'm talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| about sinkholes big enough to put a house in, and they like to tout, and at the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9605)|
| 2:40:13| I did a workshop the other night where I didn't get, wasn't able to stay long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9613)|
| 2:40:17| to speak, they talked about Cisco and how great it was that Cisco was here, and I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9617)|
| 2:40:23| delighted that Cisco is here, however, I would like to remind Council that what they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9623)|
| 2:40:28| talk about was that the Development Corporation and the City of Knoxville was sued for half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9628)|
| 2:40:35| a billion dollars because of the Cisco site where they took the contaminated soil out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9635)|
| 2:40:43| of the I-275 business park and put it in a South Knox County sinkhole, and yet they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9643)|
| 2:40:49| expect the Thorn Grove community to believe that they're not going to contaminate our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9649)|
| 2:40:54| water supply, so that's just one more issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| In the interest of time, I'm going to skip a large part of my presentation simply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9658)|
| 2:41:20| say that the community would ask that you not condone this sector plan, that you not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9680)|
| 2:41:30| condone the way that it was done, where they ran roughshod over the community, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9690)|
| 2:41:36| you not believe the Development Corporation's claims about this, I think it will be bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9696)|
| 2:41:41| for the city, I think it will be bad for city taxpayers, I think that they have shown absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9701)|
| 2:41:47| no evidence that they need this land, they have not shown any evidence that it will not take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9707)|
| 2:41:54| away from other investment in the city, and they have shown no evidence whatsoever that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9714)|
| 2:41:59| they're really going to end up with those number of jobs. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| Okay, David Boock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9724)|
| 2:42:12| You can give us your name and address, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| David Boock, 707 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| I'm an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9737)|
| 2:42:18| I represent the 8th District Property Owners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9738)|
| 2:42:24| We were the ones that filed suit three years ago and won a victory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9744)|
| 2:42:29| And that's the reason we're here today with MPC having to redo all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9749)|
| 2:42:35| My first issue was purely legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| And as I understand from what Mr. Della Volpe said, and after talking with Ms. Poplin and Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9757)|
| 2:42:44| that concern would be answered tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| And that was that in the ordinance that was posted, it was for an adoption of the entire sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9767)|
| 2:42:55| And my argument was, and I understand it's good with Able Council and Councilman Della Volpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9775)|
| 2:43:03| that it's going to be amended or stated to the point that you're only amending that part of the sector plan relating to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9783)|
| 2:43:12| I was very concerned that what was here, and I think what was being pushed by the Development Corporation and MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9792)|
| 2:43:19| was for this council to approve the entire sector plan and put its imprimatur of approval on the entire sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9799)|
| 2:43:28| So I think that's taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9808)|
| 2:43:31| Secondly, to answer Councilman Bailey's question about how it does affect the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9811)|
| 2:43:39| I think if this motion or this ordinance is amended, as I understand from Councilman Della Volpe it will be, it probably...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9819)|
| 2:43:51| On one vote, but we're going to address that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9831)|
| 2:43:54| Okay. So we don't know what it's going to be voted on, but that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9834)|
| 2:43:59| Secondly, from what I've seen, and I've dealt with this thing for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9839)|
| 2:44:05| there's nothing in this sector plan involving the city that the Development Corporation has a stake in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9845)|
| 2:44:13| So I don't understand why they have shown up and argued so vehemently, along with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9853)|
| 2:44:20| for approval by you, this body, since they don't even have a stake in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9860)|
| 2:44:27| Their property doesn't lie within the city or within the city's boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| So why are they even here arguing for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| Why did they come to the workshop and argue for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9874)|
| 2:44:37| I've been fighting, and I respect very much the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9877)|
| 2:44:42| but on this one issue it seems that Development Corporation and MPC have been partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9882)|
| 2:44:47| in fighting to find a way to overturn what Chancellor Fantzler ruled three years ago and get this approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9887)|
| 2:44:55| I would point out only two other things, since mine was mostly legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9895)|
| 2:45:00| One is I'm deeply involved in annexation suits in Chattanooga right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| I have heard through the three years from the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| all about the Volkswagen plant down there and how we didn't get the Volkswagen plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| Well, I'm here to tell you that Chattanooga has sold its soul to get that Volkswagen plant down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9913)|
| 2:45:19| They are right now, as of last week on their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9919)|
| 2:45:23| they have proposed a 64 cent increase in the property tax, 64 cents per hundred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9923)|
| 2:45:31| a 33 and a third percent increase over the present tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| And that is to fund the infrastructure and the personnel that are going to be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9936)|
| 2:45:42| to finance the Volkswagen plant down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9942)|
| 2:45:46| They've sold their soul with TIFs and other bargains, and that's what's being faced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9946)|
| 2:45:53| Fortunately, you don't have to look at that, because that's not out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| And thirdly and lastly, I just point out that we keep hearing business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9956)|
| 2:46:01| But the words three years ago, three years ago, the words of the MPC were for the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9961)|
| 2:46:09| which came in and wanted an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| They said, let's zone it business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9971)|
| 2:46:14| Let's let them have a business park, because then it will be an easier jump to get to an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9974)|
| 2:46:20| So whenever you hear them talking about a business park, they've got MPC on their side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| It would be an easy jump to rezone to industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| If you're just voting on and the ordinance is simply something that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9989)|
| 2:46:35| you're only voting on the city part and not giving approval to the rest of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9995)|
| 2:46:39| then from a legal perspective, I'm happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10002)|
| 2:46:43| Mr. DelaValle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10003)|
| 2:46:44| Before you left, Mr. Buick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| I wanted to say that you wondered why all those presentations were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10006)|
| 2:46:51| I think at the outset, we were all laboring under the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| the only option we had was to vote the entire plan up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10014)|
| 2:46:59| and that we didn't have any option to modify it or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| And so all of those proceedings took place with that assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| We learned that we were misguided, that we're really approving the part that the city has jurisdiction over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10026)|
| 2:47:12| And I'm going to be moving in that direction of clarifying the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10032)|
| 2:47:17| that was in the agenda as a blanket approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10037)|
| 2:47:21| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10041)|
| 2:47:22| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10044)|
| 2:47:25| I just want to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10045)|
| 2:47:26| Actually, Mr. DelaValle, but you're not quite right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| Okay, well, correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10049)|
| 2:47:30| When this first came up, I was aware of the boundaries and the impacts we were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10050)|
| 2:47:36| And I specifically asked the Development Corporation to come talk about the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10056)|
| 2:47:40| as a way to get us thinking about economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| It was launching us into a controversy that I don't think I understood at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10062)|
| 2:47:46| But it did also launch us into the workshop we had last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10066)|
| 2:47:50| got us a much better understanding of, I think, economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| So truth be told, they were coming so often because I was asking them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| And it was-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10077)|
| 2:47:58| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10078)|
| 2:47:59| I didn't mean to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10079)|
| 2:48:00| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10080)|
| 2:48:01| That was the assumption I was laboring under, that it was a plan up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10081)|
| 2:48:05| and it had all the pieces parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| It was, unfortunately, one of my strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10088)|
| 2:48:10| And I think you've been on Council long enough to know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10095)|
| 2:48:16| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| That's all the speakers signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10099)|
| 2:48:20| Mr. Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| Mr. Mayor, yeah, if we could-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| I don't know if you'd call it suspend the rules or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| but ask Ms. Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10104)|
| 2:48:25| She had this last slide up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| and I don't know whether she wanted to make a couple of points about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| And she did skip over some information in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| if we could give her an opportunity to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10112)|
| 2:48:35| Lisa, would you like to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| Uh-oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10120)|
| 2:48:41| Oh, here we're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10122)|
| 2:48:43| What are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10123)|
| 2:48:56| They're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10136)|
| 2:49:03| You covered that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10143)|
| 2:49:04| It's the next one, I guess, that you skipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10144)|
| 2:49:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10147)|
| 2:49:11| I guess, probably, there are two key points that I would still like to make about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10151)|
| 2:49:16| And I think that, you know, it is, again, sending a message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10156)|
| 2:49:22| that we're really not going to support urban sprawl in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10162)|
| 2:49:28| And to that end, you know, a lot has been made about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10168)|
| 2:49:34| well, we're not going to put in a sewer plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10174)|
| 2:49:37| and, you know, we're not going to do anything on the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10177)|
| 2:49:41| We're going to do everything on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10181)|
| 2:49:43| And that, somehow, is going to prevent the acreage that is in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10183)|
| 2:49:49| that is across the street from the proposed industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10189)|
| 2:49:55| It's all zone commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| And I really don't understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| this is something that we did bring up at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10199)|
| 2:50:02| how you're going to address that as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10202)|
| 2:50:05| How are you going to deal with having an industrial park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| and tell Weigels and Pilot and Hardee's that they can't be at that exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10209)|
| 2:50:16| because that commercial land can't develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| And so what we're submitting is that it is actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10220)|
| 2:50:26| this is a ruse by the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| to their long-term plan has to include sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10230)|
| 2:50:33| And so one thing that, if you'll indulge me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| I would like to show is something from the horse's mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| as to what they really are talking about with regard to the sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10240)|
| 2:51:00| Oh, is there something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10260)|
| 2:51:12| Okay, I don't seem to have audio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| But what you're looking at is a report by Mike Edwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10274)|
| 2:51:19| to county commission explaining why they're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10279)|
| 2:51:26| that it would be a good idea for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| to ultimately pursue a sewer plant on the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10289)|
| 2:51:41| With regard to the need for the business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10301)|
| 2:51:44| I would like to point out that it is a goal of a sustainable city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10304)|
| 2:51:49| to redevelop existing brownfields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10309)|
| 2:51:52| and also take advantage of business parks that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10312)|
| 2:51:55| This is 450 acre of land that is on the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10315)|
| 2:52:00| that is Pellissippi Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| They say that it's not completed yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| and that is why they don't have any tenants in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10324)|
| 2:52:07| But it looks relatively complete to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10327)|
| 2:52:10| And it looks like that if we had somebody that showed up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10330)|
| 2:52:14| hey, I'd like to put a business in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10334)|
| 2:52:17| that I can't imagine that they'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| oh, well, the sign's not done yet, so we can't put you in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10339)|
| 2:52:25| And finally, I'd like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10345)|
| 2:52:30| that we have Rutledge Pike Industrial Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10350)|
| 2:52:35| is over 2,500 acres of industrially zoned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10355)|
| 2:52:42| that we invested all the money to four-lane this highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10362)|
| 2:52:49| to put in all of the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10369)|
| 2:52:53| and I think it's a little disingenuous to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| well, it's 10 minutes or 15 minutes from the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10376)|
| 2:52:59| and so, therefore, it's not as attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10379)|
| 2:53:02| This land is, as you'll see, I've got East Bridge highlighted up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10382)|
| 2:53:09| There are hundreds of acres of property available adjacent to East Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10389)|
| 2:53:14| So if we really did have a big company come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10394)|
| 2:53:19| guys, we need 300 acres or we can't come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10399)|
| 2:53:22| it wouldn't be available if the development corporation was just interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| I know the other night Ms. Rice said that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| they're marketing everything as hard as they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10408)|
| 2:53:31| but, you know, if you go to their website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| Pellissippi Place isn't even on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| That's 450 acres of land that could be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| but I don't know how they can say they're marketing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| if it's not on their website. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| Thank you. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10425)|
| 2:53:48| That's all the speakers sent up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| Any other comments or questions? Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| Well, I wanted to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10432)|
| 2:53:55| that we turn our attention to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10435)|
| 2:53:58| because it was part of the discussion we just looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| and I think we have crafted some language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10441)|
| 2:54:04| and Mr. Swanson may have the best version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10444)|
| 2:54:07| It is the operative clause section one of the ordinance after the whereases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10447)|
| 2:54:11| Could you read that to us so that we can focus on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10451)|
| 2:54:15| I think your motion would be to amend it to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10455)|
| 2:54:19| that section one would read as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| The council hereby approves that portion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10462)|
| 2:54:25| East County Sector Plan located within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10465)|
| 2:54:28| corporate limits of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10468)|
| 2:54:31| together with any policy changes associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10471)|
| 2:54:34| and required for the changes within the corporate limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| of the City of Knoxville, dated February 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| which amends the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| attached hereto as Exhibit 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10483)|
| 2:54:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10486)|
| 2:54:49| Nick, would you like to make an additional comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| No, if you would read the second part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10492)|
| 2:54:55| after within the corporate city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| we'll understand that last piece of language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10498)|
| 2:55:01| After the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10501)|
| 2:55:04| No, it says within the corporate city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10504)|
| 2:55:07| Located within the corporate limits of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10507)|
| 2:55:10| together with any policy changes associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10510)|
| 2:55:14| the changes within the corporate limits of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10514)|
| 2:55:17| Because there's all actions necessary to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10517)|
| 2:55:20| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| That's the motion that we're proposing as read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10523)|
| 2:55:26| Okay, so that's a motion and Mr. Becker seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10526)|
| 2:55:29| Any questions or conversation on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| Okay, is everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| Okay, you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| Seeing no lights, I'm going to move that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10538)|
| 2:55:41| All those in favor, aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| Okay, I heard eight ayes and zero noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10544)|
| 2:55:51| Okay, now it's amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| I just wanted to briefly, and I mean very briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10554)|
| 2:55:57| thank the people in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| that have worked so hard to at least express their views to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| I know that on both sides we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| a tremendous amount of energy expended to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| about the proposed development as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| the damage that that might cause to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| as a spin-off from that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| And I know that both sides have been, at least in my way of thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| very sincere about their concerns and I do appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| and I do appreciate the time they took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| to both investigate it and to talk to us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| Thank you. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| Yeah, I, like Mr. Villalobos, have been very impressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| on this and frankly I'm glad that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| I did sort of stumble down this road of talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10600)|
| 2:56:43| having the Development Corporation talk about the business part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10603)|
| 2:56:46| because it did, I think, get us a crash course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10606)|
| 2:56:49| in economic development that I think will be valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10609)|
| 2:56:52| over the years. I just wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| the question raised about what would be the east side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10615)|
| 2:56:58| of Midway Road that is in the city that's currently zone C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10618)|
| 2:57:01| that, I think you've all heard this song and dance before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10621)|
| 2:57:04| that I'm very excited about starting the process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| rezoning that to at least a planned commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| And interestingly, I think the issues raised tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10630)|
| 2:57:13| suggest that perhaps we can look down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10633)|
| 2:57:16| at even a further downzoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10636)|
| 2:57:19| My understanding is this land is zoned for a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10639)|
| 2:57:22| because there are billboards there and I assume they'd be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10642)|
| 2:57:25| pre-existing uses if... No, they're not billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10645)|
| 2:57:28| They were going to be billboards, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10648)|
| 2:57:32| But we're at least moving into a planned commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10652)|
| 2:57:35| which gets a much better functional use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10655)|
| 2:57:38| So I'm very excited about starting that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10658)|
| 2:57:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10661)|
| 2:57:44| Now we're back to the motion. Excuse me, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| Okay, we're back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| Any further questions or comments? Okay, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10673)|
| 2:57:56| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10676)|
| 2:57:59| I think it's extremely important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10679)|
| 2:58:02| we let the citizens know that what we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| is we've approved the Knoxville city part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10685)|
| 2:58:08| East Sector Plan. Now I know that there's been talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| all along about what's what and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10691)|
| 2:58:14| but I think there's still some confusion out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10694)|
| 2:58:17| at least among some of my constituents, that think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| if we approve this, we've approved the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| And so I think it's really important that the word gets out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10703)|
| 2:58:26| that what we've done is we've approved what's within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10706)|
| 2:58:29| on that. So I'd like to make sure that that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| and it's read loud and clear. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10712)|
| 2:58:35| And hopefully the ordinance will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| Excuse me, Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| What did he say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10724)|
| 2:58:47| He said, Mr. DelVolpe said hopefully the ordinance will make that clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10727)|
| 2:58:50| and Mr. Swanson said it's clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10730)|
| 2:58:53| I'm assuming we can do that, Ms. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10733)|
| 2:58:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10742)|
| 2:59:05| That brings us to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| We have one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10748)|
| 2:59:11| Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10751)|
| 2:59:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| Ron Peabody, 625 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| I'll apologize for the late hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10763)|
| 2:59:26| and I would normally have probably delayed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| but I feel like it's an urgent issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| That's why I'm going to go ahead and present this this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10772)|
| 2:59:35| Thank you for allowing me to address you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| on a matter of utmost importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| I've come to ask city council to perform an inquiry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| relating to the actions of our city law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10784)|
| 2:59:48| concerning sections 708 and 709 of the Knoxville City Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| Our law department has in the past few weeks advised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10791)|
| 2:59:54| the Tennessee State Division of Elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10794)|
| 2:59:57| that they have found flaws in our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| which interfere with the rights of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| to redress the city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| Because the actions of our city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| the coordinator of elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| is now considering writing a new charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10812)|
| 3:00:16| is now considering writing an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10816)|
| 3:00:19| which would render provisions of sections 708 and 709 invalid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10819)|
| 3:00:22| Meaning that to have a referendum on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10822)|
| 3:00:25| we would have to collect twice the number of signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10825)|
| 3:00:28| as the total number of people who voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10828)|
| 3:00:31| in the last mayoral election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| And that city council would not have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10834)|
| 3:00:37| to take action on the referendums before going to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| as stated in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10840)|
| 3:00:43| This is neither right nor fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10843)|
| 3:00:46| Section 709 has been amended in both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10846)|
| 3:00:49| 2003 and 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| Yet according to Ronald Mills, the deputy law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| each time in this decade this section has been amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| it was not amended correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10858)|
| 3:01:01| to conform to the Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10861)|
| 3:01:04| This should trouble all voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10864)|
| 3:01:07| How does this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10867)|
| 3:01:10| Is this a case of 709 neglect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10870)|
| 3:01:13| A case of indifference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10873)|
| 3:01:16| Or something worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10876)|
| 3:01:19| We met with Knox County election officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10879)|
| 3:01:22| and read the city charter and followed it to the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10882)|
| 3:01:25| Our referendums were approved by the State Division of Elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10885)|
| 3:01:28| And then we learned of a challenge by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10888)|
| 3:01:31| our own city law department to the legality of our referendums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10891)|
| 3:01:34| Referendums that had already been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10894)|
| 3:01:37| by the Tennessee State Coordinator of Elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10897)|
| 3:01:40| How is it possible that our own law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10900)|
| 3:01:43| has taken actions to disenfranchise the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10903)|
| 3:01:46| of the city of Knoxville in this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10906)|
| 3:01:49| Whatever the law is, we will comply with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10909)|
| 3:01:52| But our group feels that an inquiry into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10912)|
| 3:01:55| stunning revelation is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10915)|
| 3:01:58| At this point in time, no written opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| has been given by Mark Goins, the Tennessee State Coordinator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10921)|
| 3:02:04| We are a home rule municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| and we have the right to choose our own standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| rather than rely on state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10930)|
| 3:02:13| We have fought long and hard for this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10933)|
| 3:02:16| As soon as an opinion is rendered by Mr. Goins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| we will seek action in court with a Knoxville Chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| We request a view, a definitive inquiry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10942)|
| 3:02:25| of how this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10945)|
| 3:02:28| We expect that our charter is whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10948)|
| 3:02:31| The city council and the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10951)|
| 3:02:34| Our group wants to ensure that this will never happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10954)|
| 3:02:37| I ask council to carefully consider this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10957)|
| 3:02:40| and ultimately to restore the rights of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10960)|
| 3:02:43| to redress the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10963)|
| 3:02:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10966)|
| 3:02:49| Just for the record, that came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10969)|
| 3:02:52| Actually the state election commission called us with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10972)|
| 3:02:55| and then they said their law supersedes ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10975)|
| 3:02:59| Just to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| If there are documents that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10982)|
| 3:03:05| please submit them to Ms. Mitchell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10985)|
| 3:03:08| and we'd be happy to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10988)|
| 3:03:11| I've spoken with Beth Henry Robertson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| and Beth Henry Robertson said this was not initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=10997)|
| 3:03:20| This was initiated by the law department of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| Beth called us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11003)|
| 3:03:27| Does she tell me an untruth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11007)|
| 3:03:30| Our state election commission or our state election board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11010)|
| 3:03:33| not tell me the truth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11013)|
| 3:03:36| The reality is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11016)|
| 3:03:39| State law prevails in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11019)|
| 3:03:42| We were the ones going by the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11022)|
| 3:03:45| I'm not sure how we got to be the bad guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11025)|
| 3:03:48| We were the ones saying our rules applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11028)|
| 3:03:51| The state came in and said no, their rules apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11031)|
| 3:03:55| Our legal team and myself have talked with the state election officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11035)|
| 3:03:58| and that is not the facts of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11038)|
| 3:04:01| Quite frankly, if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11041)|
| 3:04:04| then what I would suggest is that this city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11044)|
| 3:04:07| take action to correct it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11047)|
| 3:04:10| They can take that action because they can put ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11050)|
| 3:04:13| on the ballot and it can go before the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11053)|
| 3:04:16| in November to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11056)|
| 3:04:19| That's the point of why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11059)|
| 3:04:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11063)|
| 3:04:26| Thank you. We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100601?start=11066)|
