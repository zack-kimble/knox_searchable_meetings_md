| 1:39:36| and the money belongs in the hands of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| I also called for an audit when I discovered potential criminal activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| which resulted, as you know, in the indictment of three individuals for theft and improper conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| because I will not tolerate any stealing or any impropriety under my administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5990)|
| 1:39:57| We have our first full-time ever training director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| and so what that means is what we do in the Knox County downtown office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| we also do in our halls and our Farragut office and all of our other offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:13| Complaints have basically evaporated, and in stark contrast, compliments have vastly increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:21| We're doing more business than ever online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| and our program, which we call why stand in line when you can go online 24 hours a day, seven days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| and we conduct quarterly employee reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| and demand what I believe are the highest standards for any clerk's office in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| So in short, I'm proud to say that we're working for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| We're doing it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| We're doing it with less people, and we're doing it with a sense of pride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| and I can say that for each and every one of my employees because we follow our motto, honor above all else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| and do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| If you have any questions, I'll be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| I also just want to reiterate a couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| We were actually paying people to come in and water plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| And we were paying people to bring in first aid kits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| And you did find ghost employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| Can I hug you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| My wife's watching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| I really wish she wouldn't, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| The reason I say that is because these are the things that a responsible office holder would have never tolerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| in the first place, and I'm not trying to cast aspersions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| but I'm just saying how much I appreciate as a taxpayer, as a citizen, that you've come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| and that you've cleaned up that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| And I also want to say how much I enjoy working with your employees here on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| They're first class, and they do a great job for us as well as our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| I think they do a great job, and I'm not going to come up here and sub for any of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| because I've told them I wouldn't have their job for any measure or any money because I think they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| But I just appreciate the fact that you have taken the actions that you've taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| And, again, as a citizen and a taxpayer, I'm very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| I was getting ready to ask if he was going to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| Well, I will if the chairman so requests me to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| But I won't do as good a job as Angie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| Or Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| Or Sandra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| You did a good job of answering the questions that I had that you did not hear me read earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| You compared the budget of last year to this, well, savings of budget in budget now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| And the budget that is being proposed for you next year, did you say that was a good budget for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| We've gone down every single year, Commissioner, and we're running about as lean as we can run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| But if you all want us to run leaner, we'll run leaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| No, that was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| That's the last part of the question is you will continue to look at improving the quality and reducing the expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6173)|
| 1:43:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| You've answered all my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| I'm just blown away with everything you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| It's just first class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Thanks, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| I mean, it's just refreshing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| And when you stop and you think about it, like, well, duh, I'm like Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| It should have been done that way to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| And I just, as a citizen, you make me real proud of how you have conducted yourself and your office and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6202)|
| 1:43:30| So my hat's off to all your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| Now, what do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| You've got a lot of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| Foster, you have come in from day one and have done a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| Do you have something that you're just on the tip of making some other changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| I attribute it to my employees that I work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| We have an inverted pyramid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| I'm at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| They're at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| And they are the ones that come up with the great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| They're the ones that never complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| They're the ones that come in and say, how can I help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| And it's these three ladies up here who are just the epitome of the employees that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| And we're going to continue to seek all kinds of savings and everything we can do to save the Knox County taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:16| Because, folks, it's not our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| It's your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| And it's the taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| And that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| Tell us about the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| You said not to take travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:25| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| I did take a travel allowance and I took it away from myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| It's $8,400 a year that I don't take anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| We thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Thanks, Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| I did have a question about improving quality on something that might help us improve our quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| I'd heard there was a voting system that possibly you were investigating about how we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6284)|
| 1:44:51| You know, we do it sequentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| Sometimes that gets into a little bit of an issue when Sam's got to go first all the time and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6293)|
| 1:45:00| And, you know, the simultaneous voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| Have you all done some of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:05| I have not, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| We've talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| And that would be something I'd love to talk to you all about because I think it would be great to have a tote board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| up here and have some type of a voting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| It just depends on how much it costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| I certainly would encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| We'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| That would be something that we could share with the city as well or anybody that uses this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| So it wouldn't be just total county costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| But we'll take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| Commissioner Smith, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| Commissioner Rotten had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| You may have said it when we misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| Do you have extra employees on travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| Are they taking reimbursement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| We have basically two employees that take travel reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| And they're the two ladies that do our auto dealerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| And they actually go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| Oh, they have to go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| They're on mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6356)|
| 1:45:57| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Foster, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| Register of Deeds, Sherry Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| Sherry, anything that you would like to share with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| And then we'll see if we have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6366)|
| 1:46:13| Thank you, Commissioners, for giving me the opportunity to be before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| I just want to say that I've been listening to these other office holders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| And I just feel very blessed that I haven't had a lot of the problems that the other offices have had to be faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| So I have a great staff, and they're just wonderful to work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| And I just want to say that we've been proactive in this economy the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| We didn't just start this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| We've been decreasing for the last four years to the point that we have cut it pretty slim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| And I'm just very proud of my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| As Dr. Briggs said, with the county auditors as well as the state auditors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| anyone that goes in the Register of Deeds office says that we are one of the best offices that they have ever seen as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6414)|
| 1:47:02| far as the books and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| So as far as the money, we're asking for $82,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| I wish I could say that we had reduced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| If you're looking at your budget from 2011, the rent has been taken out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| So that's why it looks like such a reduction, which actually we are holding the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| So that being said, if there's anything that you all would like to ask me, I'm here with my bookkeeper and chief deputy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:27| Richie Beeler and Nick McBride to answer any and all questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| I just want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| I just want to make a comment and it sort of is what you alluded to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| and just confirm that I did say that I did look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| And I think it's fair to say that the Register of the Deeds office, the management of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| has preceded the recent elections or the recent change in administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| And even when we had our outside auditor come in a couple of years ago and look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| they found no problems in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| And there certainly were issues in some of the other offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| Some of them were just less than optimal bookkeeping, but there's never been any problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| And sort of the same compliments that Commissioner Smith gave to the county clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6489)|
| 1:48:16| I'd like to give to you that it's been a very, very well run office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| Thank you, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Ma'am, the number you gave there, 82,400, that's your operational budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6504)|
| 1:48:32| That is the operational budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| This year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| This year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| Is that the same as the operational budget last year that commission approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| I think it was actually 82,900 last year, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| Well, then you did fulfill one of the questions that you may not have heard me ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| Your budget this year is less than your budget last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6535)|
| 1:48:56| Sherry, you've got one of the most friendly offices in this courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| Your staff, I mean, you can tell that you treat them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| They're just so, so nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| I mean, even Richie puts a smile on his face when you go by his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| But, I mean, everybody knows what they're doing and they're not just sitting around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| My question is on the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| What's your feeling on the travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| How much do you get travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| What do you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| We have one travel allowance in the office and that's mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| My car is used for any time that anyone has to go out as far as any educational purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| We do, you know, a speech at lunch, at night, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| That's where the money goes for as far as the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| If that is, you know, something that we feel like that we can look at, I'm definitely open to looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| How much is that, Sherry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| How much is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| I think it's $700 a month, $8,400 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| So you loan your car out to people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| Anything that goes out of the office is my car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| And that's not the county car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| That's my personal car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| My insurance probably wouldn't like to hear that a lot, but, yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| Do you feel that travel could be cut down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| You know, to say that I've actually taken the numbers and looked at the mileage that the county gives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| which is I think what a lot of the offices are doing on any kind of county employee travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| Commissioner Smith, any time I go to Nashville or anything else that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| I don't ask for any kind of reimbursement on anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| We could, you know, maybe monitor that for a couple of months or something and look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| and see if that could be decreased by just getting mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| Have you gotten with John Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| Have you all looked at any of that, tried to compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| John, have you looked at anything like that to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| Sherry, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| Is Ms. Quist here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| Kathy Quist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| Oh, here she comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6656)|
| 1:51:05| Ms. Quist, if you would, any remarks you'd like to make to us about your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| and we'll see if we have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| I want to apologize that I don't have a glossy presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| Everyone else has been quite articulate today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| I've been at the state court clerk's conference for the last couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| and this took me by surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| But, you know, what the mayor recommended was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| The primary area that we were cut in was banking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| and our banking expenses are significant with the maintenance of trust accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| and all that we do in order to provide many different ways for people to pay their court costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6693)|
| 1:51:39| and pay their bills, pay restitution, juvenile court, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| So we're fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| We've cut back and cut back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| We did ask for two new positions in the child support division of juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| We've seen a 22 percent increase in filings annually in that court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| So we have been inundated quite literally with paper, with all of the wage assignments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6716)|
| 1:52:03| the filing has increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| So we've seen a significant increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| He did not recommend those two positions, so we'll make do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| Any questions for Ms. Quist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| That was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Is Ms. McCroskey here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| She's in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| I do not see her here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Gloria Ray with the Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| Gloria, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Would you give us your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Gloria Ray, 4833 River Place Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| And would you give us a rundown of the hotel-motel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| There's going to be some questions about that, but I'd like for you to make any presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| you'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| Let me first talk about the KTSC, which is the Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| That was the combination of the Convention and Visitors Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| and the Sports Corporation in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| And so we operate now under that premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| We are solely funded by hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| So our budget, in terms of Commissioner Wright trying to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| it really depends on what the collections are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| And going in the year advance, when you're doing your budgeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| it's based on what the projection of that will be, based on the past history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| based on the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| And so Finance Department comes up with an estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| or projected collection of hotel-motel taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| And then from that, the application is made of the formula that has been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6816)|
| 1:53:43| and is under contract both from the state and from our level as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| We are an economic development organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| We are to use that money to try and grow the hotel-motel tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| There's no property tax or no sales tax in the funding whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6834)|
| 1:54:00| I have prepared for you, if you would like, kind of an executive summary of hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:10| as to how that is collected, what's the premise of it, a little bit of the history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| So if you will allow me, I will pass those out to you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| And at the same time, I'm going to pass out an economic impact formula explanation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| We have some folks that will help you pass those out, Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6873)|
| 1:54:45| Just a little history, since I'm probably the oldest one in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| The hotel-motel tax, and I say it with due respect to Frank Leuthold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| who was chair of the Finance Committee for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| And under him, they had a subcommittee called the Hotel-Motel Subcommittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| that was chaired by Wanda Moody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| At that time, they took applications from various organizations within the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| to award a percentage of the hotel-motel tax that was collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| And I'm giving you just some background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| And what happened there is that the sports corporation got about 8% of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| and the remaining 2% was allocated to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| And what had occurred to Ms. Moody, what she did was had them fill out a questionnaire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| of questions as to what is your core mission, what do you do, how do you spend this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| And it became very clear that their core mission was probably not in tourist development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| It was more in delivering programmatic, whether it be the historical homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6944)|
| 1:55:52| or the museum of art, whatever it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| So that's where you saw the change then go into the community grant program from the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6954)|
| 1:56:00| What I have passed out, let me go over first of all the hotel-motel room tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| It is a tax of 5% only on the lodging fees that are paid in the hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:10| It does not include any incidental charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| It does not include food and beverage or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| The budget implications, that's where the finance department projects what they think that tax will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| I will tell you that before KTSC became operational, the three-year average before that was $3.8 million a year was what was collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:34| Three-year average was $3.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| We have been able to grow that to a high level of $5.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=6996)|
| 1:56:41| So obviously what we're doing is working and I'm very, very proud of our staff for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| And then the economy hit and people stopped traveling as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| and the convention numbers were going down a little bit, so we dropped down the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| Last year's budget was based on a collection of $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7017)|
| 1:57:03| This year, this coming year's budget that you're considering now is based on a collection of 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:10| So I think Commissioner Wright, that may answer that question for you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| What I'm saying is the decline happened real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| It went from 5.3 downward very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| Our growth, we're fighting like heck and we're coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| We've gone from 4.8 to 5 million to 5.2 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7045)|
| 1:57:30| We think we will be back to where we were in the best of times, probably in another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| Because what's interesting is that if you look at what our job entails, it's going out and getting leads and making proposals and then signing the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:47| And the third thing is then for them to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Well, during this economy, we have seen while the collections went down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| and therefore our budgets have gone down the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| is that our signing and our leads have continued to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| So maybe we were out selling hope that things are going to be better and people were signing deals to come in future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7082)|
| 1:58:08| So we felt really good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| So the budget this year is based on a collection of 5.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| We think that's reachable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| We think that's attainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| If it's not, if the collection is not 5.2 million at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| we then have to pay back what you paid to us during that 12-month period that was not actually collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| So that's a challenge during the year to always be mindful of what your collections are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:34| and making any adjustments in terms of staffing or any other programmatic things that you may do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:41| The purpose of the taxes, as I stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| is to really use tourism as an economic development engine driver for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| And we're charged with the famous phrase, I think, is heads and beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| And that's really what we're charged to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| because that's the only way that you grow your hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| An example would be with Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| Somebody says, well, how much does Boomsday bring in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| We report that as zero economic impact and zero hotel room nights because we don't know who came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:15| We don't block the rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| We don't know that any money is spent new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| Is it just a matter of they were going to spend it in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| and they came downtown and spent it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| So we don't, while it's 400,000 people, we don't count that as any economic impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| just to have some credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| So the question to always ask when looking at hotel-motel tax is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| will this use of money increase the pool of hotel-motel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| Because the spinoff of that is the economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| That's money to you all as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| The additional benefits of tourism is the economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| And we've talked about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| We bring in, we booked each year about $136 million in economic impact business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| that brings that kind of money to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| So we're real pleased with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7202)|
| 2:00:03| That continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| The distribution of the tax, it was enabling legislation from the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7205)|
| 2:00:10| that you all worked out with the state many, many years ago, prior to my time even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| and that 40% of that is to be spent on capital projects or debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7215)|
| 2:00:21| you know, retiring your debt service for tourist-related activities or projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7221)|
| 2:00:26| Not activities, but more projects because it has to be a debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| So that's where the first 40% of that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| Knox County then also does a pass-through to the city of Knoxville of 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:40| And I don't know if that's in recognition of that some of those hotels must be in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| And so there's a pass-through of 10% of that hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| The county hotel-motel tax goes to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| Knox County, through contract with us, gives 45% of the hotel-motel tax comes directly to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7252)|
| 2:00:59| That leaves an amount of 5% at your discretion to use on tourist-related activities or projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:06| And again, you need to go back and say, what's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| Is this money going to grow that hotel-motel tax base?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| And again, I remind you that when we combined the two organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| the sports corps and the Convention and Visitors Bureau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| we were able to pass along a savings of about 3% by combining the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| So we gave you rather than 2% to split up, you now have 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| Sample distribution fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| I'm from Fulton, so we used an easy number, 5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| So I broke out there what each entity and how that would be derived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7296)|
| 2:01:42| So that is the hotel-motel tax session 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| And I hope that helps a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| The adjoining piece is the economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| The background of that is there is a national organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| called Destination Marketing International Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| Or it's Association International, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| And they come up with a formula to designate what you should use for figuring hotel-motel tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| because those numbers are all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| Some cities will use a multiplier of 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| Some will just use outrageous numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| So we took what they recommended for a medium-sized city in the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:22| We took that formula and used that one except we did downgrade the hotel-motel lodging numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:29| They were over $100 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| We reduced that to 84 simply because our hotels are not charging that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:38| And so we reduced that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| And so how you figure economic impact is you take your number of delegates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7360)|
| 2:02:46| times the number of days that they're in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| That gives you the delegate days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| And then you multiply that by the 230 for your daily expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| So I gave you a sample there of a 300-person attendee group for three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| 900,000, I mean, 900 delegate days times the daily expenditure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:09| for our economic impact would be $324,990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| The direct spending plus the multiplier of 1.57, that's what the state of Tennessee uses on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| Like I say, some cities will use as much as 10, 15, or 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| And their numbers look real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| But I don't think I can explain or justify numbers any higher than what we're showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:31| Additional factors to consider when applying the economic impact numbers to maintain credibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| because I think there's always been a question, well, that's just smoke and mirrors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| Where did they come up with those numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| And so as an example, I'll give you the best example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| It's the AAU Junior Olympic Games, which were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| We had 15,000 registered participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| That's athletes, coaches, and trainers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| That's all that we counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| We did not count mom and dad, sisters and brothers, mammals and papaws who may have come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| because we don't know how many parents, you know, accompanied the athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| We don't know how many brothers and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| So therefore, to be credible, we use just the number of registered credentialed participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| either at a sporting event or at a conference or at a convention or at a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| So we have to be able to justify that number so that somebody doesn't come back to us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| you know, how do you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| And so I think we've got some, particularly on our youth groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| we're probably very low on our economic impact estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| But that may count up for some of the, what we call the stuff that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| the leakage that may go to Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| They may go up there and go to an attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| So we think that may count up for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| And again, I used the example of the Booms Day in terms of it really being no economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| or we don't count it as any economic impact because I can't validate any numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| and I don't know who they are or where they spent their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7501)|
| 2:05:07| I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| I will tell you our leads have continued to go up even in the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| Our bookings have actually continued to go up even in place of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| The collections, we went down, but we are now fighting back and coming back to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| We're at 5.2 this year projected and hopefully in the next year we can get back to 5.3 and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7523)|
| 2:05:31| So we're pleased with his projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| In years past, you can play the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| You can project low and then at the end of the year you have money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| and then how do you use it, you know, smartly to grow that tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7540)|
| 2:05:46| If you produce, I mean, if you project high, you don't actually collect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| So I think the finance department working together over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| we've done a pretty good job of figuring out what that number should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| so that the reconciliation is not so great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| I will also say that the clerk's office, even though I put trustee's office, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| The clerk's office collects that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| We've worked with them closely in that it's totally a voluntary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| The hotels fill out a monthly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| They then turn in how much money they owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| And so working with them, we've really, we used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7577)|
| 2:06:22| the only stick that we had is that if you're not paid up to date on your hotel-motel taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7582)|
| 2:06:27| you're not going to be in our visitor's guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| You're not going to be on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| You're not going to be on touch, know, and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| That's the only leverage that we had because we list all hotels, all restaurants at no cost to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:38| But we felt like, to be fair, if they weren't up to date on their payments, they are not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:44| Question, the 2% payment, is that a statute or is that a voluntary 2% payment to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7604)|
| 2:06:51| I guess you said the clerk's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| That's, I think, built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| I mean, that's what, since they collect it, we just always know that we get net of that 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| Okay, but I mean, is that a statute thing or is that something that's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7623)|
| 2:07:04| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Mr. Ray, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| I do appreciate the work that you and your staff do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| I think you do a great job promoting Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| Me and you had a conversation a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| You said the city has a 3% tax on top of our 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| Do they give any money to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| Because, I mean, we give them 10% of our taxes collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| Why do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| If we're funding, you know, most of the hotels are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| Even Turkey Creek and I think the only hotels that are not in the city are probably Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| I can't think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| There's about 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| Maybe some in Straw Plains that are on the border there, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| I think that the city's 3% and certainly they can speak for themselves, but I think the 3% is what they're using for their debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:50| service for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| So there's no allocations from that to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| None of that goes to your office for promotion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| We get some from marketing, but it's not tied to that 3% hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| So we're also, we're paying debt on the convention center as a county and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| and then we're also giving the city 10% of our tax, and they're taking 3% of their tax to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| On a $5 million budget, that's $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| We could do a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| The thing is, you know, the city, we're giving a lot to non-profits and tourist attractions such as James White Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| and East Tennessee Historic Society, I mean, and Beck Cultural Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| but we're also giving them $500,000 to do that too with our tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7714)|
| 2:08:38| I think they then turn around and use that because it is tourist related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| They then, if you look at the grants that they make as well to organizations within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7722)|
| 2:08:49| The Beck, I think, gets $20,000 from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| The theater, the zoo, so they're using that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| Because it all goes back into that package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| It must be tourist related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| So that kind of paints the picture for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| Is that state mandated or is that just the agreement we worked out years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| I think the ability to, I mean, I think the state allowed you to do a hotel-motel tax based on the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7748)|
| 2:09:14| you would then use that money and reinvest it in activities that would increase hotel-motel tax collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7754)|
| 2:09:22| It's an economic development tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| And you mean you discussed this because, you know, I'd ask what another percent would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7764)|
| 2:09:30| and I think that the consensus between the hotels and your staff is that one percent would put us at nine percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:37| as a county and city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| Because that's 20 percent tax on the hotel rate once you pay the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| The national average is 7.4, but Knox County is a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:50| If you look at our eight percent, which is even a little bit more than 7.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| you have to add on to that our sales tax, which is nine and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7793)|
| 2:09:58| And so when you add nine and a quarter to eight percent, you're charging, you know, 17 and a quarter percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| which is a pretty high number for your tourists to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| Does that mean that we won't get conventions or meetings or sporting events because of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| Probably the argument could be made either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| But I don't know what type of taste it will leave in the mouth to those that weren't prepared for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7816)|
| 2:10:22| when they look at a hotel room and then they get ready to check out and there's a 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| and a quarter percent tax put on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| Thank you for the work you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| Does the town of Farragut get any money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| You mentioned the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7835)|
| 2:10:38| Gloria, you keep such good records and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| A UT home football game, how much do we make off of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:46| We don't count any economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| You don't count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7848)|
| 2:10:49| No, because we don't, we did not generate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| Well, because they turn in how many people spent the night there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| Yes, but we don't block the rooms or track them or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| I can get you those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| Hotel weekends are certainly good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| That's not the, we don't use those in our numbers of the 136 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| I bet you have it for the Lady Vols, though, wouldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| I'd have a closer guess probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7873)|
| 2:11:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| Thank you, Ms. Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7876)|
| 2:11:17| You did answer basically all of my questions about last year's budget, this year's budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| and next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| The thing that I want to give you, and that's an A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| so I give you extra points on the fact that at the commissioner's lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7887)|
| 2:11:33| we were handed out an example of where the money goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| And now you've handed out an example of where the money goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| I back up early on in your presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| you kept using these figures that are almost too big for us to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| The example we had at lunch was on a $100 motel room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| And it gives, you know, generates a $5 tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| And they, the allocation of that $5 tracks right along with what you had to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7922)|
| 2:12:11| about the four places it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| The comment that I wanted to make on how it breaks down on debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| probably, though, all of the debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| and I'm asking a question now of my fellow commissioners and of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:26| probably all of the debt would be on things that are inside the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7946)|
| 2:12:32| not only in Knox County, because the city of Knoxville is in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| but those buildings that we have debt on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| is that what we're looking at, the debt service to pay for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| Well, I know at one time the debt service was used to retire the debt on Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7963)|
| 2:12:51| That was, and it was paid off using that 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| And that's outside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| Well, you know, the annexation, I don't, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| No, but that may be paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| Now, maybe we need to go back and reallocate these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| No, I'm not for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| I like the allocation as it stands now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7990)|
| 2:13:11| So most things are going to be inside the city of Knoxville that we're paying off the debt on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:17| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| We don't, I don't have anything to do with where that 40% goes or how it's spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| I do know that the convention center, you put a cap on what you would be willing to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:33| At one time, I think there was a request that all of that go to retire the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| and there was some discussions made to where it ends up that there's only a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8018)|
| 2:13:43| That probably got me in trouble with one of the previous mayors, and I'll let you all guess who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| Let me back up on the $100 again then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| I'll start again from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| The hotel motel tax breakdown for retirement of debt, the $100 would generate $5 toward, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8034)|
| 2:14:03| would generate $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8043)|
| 2:14:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| Of that, then something's going to county debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| That leaves you and goes into the county coffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| Is that right, John Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:14| We don't actually get all the $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| He gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| He gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| He's sitting back there shaking his head up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| He gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| Let me say the foster gets it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| Then their folks do a real good job of allocating to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| It runs about 45 days behind for everybody to collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| It's worked very well, and they've done a great job of collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8077)|
| 2:14:42| In our example, then, 50 cents goes to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8082)|
| 2:14:49| $2.25 goes to you for continued development of touristy things, the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8089)|
| 2:14:55| To get people to stay in the hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| That's my sole purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| To get people to call and invite people to come to Knoxville and stay with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| Advertise and do all that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| So that the part that remains, 25 cents, is then divided up among, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8105)|
| 2:15:14| Your example said $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| Is divided up among those touristy things in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:23| What I wanted you to do was to, I remember over the last three years, we've talked about this several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| It is a state allowable thing that if we want to do it, we can charge this tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8130)|
| 2:15:36| But the state mandates where we spend that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8136)|
| 2:15:40| It's got to be on tourist or tourist development activities, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8140)|
| 2:15:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8144)|
| 2:15:45| I think that probably, and this was prior to me, I think that Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| probably when they went to the state, outlined how they would spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8148)|
| 2:15:52| But all of it is still tied to tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| Whether if it's 40 percent is going to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| And John, you can help me out here if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| I'm drowning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| But 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| Oh, you're doing terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8162)|
| 2:16:03| You're doing terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8163)|
| 2:16:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| So I think those percentages were probably done by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8165)|
| 2:16:10| But all of it still has to go back to tourist related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| Example would be, the best example I've got is when Wanda had her thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:19| is the Humane Society came and asked for money from hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| You know, it was like, how can the Humane Society need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| And I think I've used this example before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| And their answer was, is to make it tourist related, is that sometime when visitors are in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8188)|
| 2:16:34| they lose their dog and we have to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| So that was a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| And see, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| They did not get funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| You are headed toward the place that I wanted us to be in a sort of a thumbnail sketch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| of what you perceive to be tourist related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| And then you gave one example of not tourist related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| Might you have others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| The only example I can give which usually gets people's attention is they say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8213)|
| 2:16:59| we have an event or we have a festival or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| And I would say, well, how many rooms, hotel rooms do you use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| And using the math, if someone said, well, we think we use 1,000 hotel room nights, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8226)|
| 2:17:14| for our event, in reality, that produces $1,800 from hotel-motel tax that would be awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:25| So when you start looking at it that way, you realize that it's not the individual or small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:31| it's the cumulative effect of all the marketing, you know, that you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| whether it be a 20-person group or a 15,000-person group and everything in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:43| you're generating hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| It's the name of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| So that's what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| Being last, all of the accolades have been laid upon you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8274)|
| 2:17:58| Well, you'll probably change that real quick, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| A couple of things that maybe people don't understand about your outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| You're not just out there selling what we have to offer here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| You're out there helping those of us in Knox County prepare things for you to go out there and sell, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8292)|
| 2:18:20| And that's the part that I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8300)|
| 2:18:22| I mean, you've worked with some groups that I've been working with on two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| or three different projects over the last couple of years locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| not only to but down to the bottom line of helping some of the locals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| even to the point of when the bridge is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:39| one of our folks volunteered to help do some promotion for the merchants south of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| These are the type of things that keep us going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| And I truly appreciate what you and your staff, you've got a great staff over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| and I appreciate the help for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8336)|
| 2:18:57| The stakeholders are great partners to us, so we kind of promote each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| And, you know, being quite sensitive, Sam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8341)|
| 2:19:05| I will tell you that the Beck Cultural Center, I know, is an issue that will come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| and we work with Avon as best we can to try and promote it on our web| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| and in our visitors' guides and in our museums of Knoxville guides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| We've just recently done a video to put on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| and also on our Touch, Know, and Go machines of the Alex Haley statue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| In other words, our job is to make people aware of what's out there to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| and, quite honestly, the South Knoxville thing, it was an economic development thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8370)|
| 2:19:35| We've got to get people to spend money when they're here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| So I'm trying to get my arms around the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8386)|
| 2:19:51| and you and I talked last week as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| So out of the hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| and this may be a question for finance, so I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8397)|
| 2:20:01| there's $250 going to us for allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| And I guess I'm trying to figure out the dollar amount to that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8407)|
| 2:20:13| I saw where $200,000, according to the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:17| and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| went toward community grants out of hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| So, again, I'll look to John or one of his other staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8424)|
| 2:20:31| Is there somebody behind me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| Oh, there's John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| So I see where $200,000, John, went to community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| and $150,000 went to women's basketball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8439)|
| 2:20:48| Hall of Fame, plus the monies that went to Beck and Mabry Hayes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| and the other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| So could you help me out with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| Another $1.5 million goes to the city of Knoxville for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| I'm saying, but that doesn't add up to $250,000 on this $5 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| That adds up to a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| We talked earlier about this, and we'll get a full schedule for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| but I've been in the same meetings you've been in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| Oh, I know, but I keep getting this $250,000 number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:21| that that's what we're basing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| that that's all that Knox County has to spend on these other entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:30| and it sounds like there's a lot more presently going after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| So, again, I'm just trying to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| So, I mean, that was one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8496)|
| 2:21:38| This is another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| So, okay, you'll get back with me on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| And it comes back, and we'll be glad to do the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| but you take the pieces of it and the big pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| We'll spell it all out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| It doesn't leave a lot of elbow room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| but we'll spell that out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| It seemed like there's, that we're running at a deficit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8516)|
| 2:21:59| so that'll be good if I pronounce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8519)|
| 2:22:02| Now you feel our fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| Gloria, so you spent a little time talking about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8527)|
| 2:22:12| and I do appreciate you taking time to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| You spent a little time talking about what you don't claim or sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8536)|
| 2:22:20| whether it's Boomsday or UT and Lady Vols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8540)|
| 2:22:23| Could you provide me with a list of what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| hang your hat on, and what types of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| Yes, and we actually send quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| They're probably so thick that you all don't take the time to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| We have it listed, anything from five people to 15 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| Yeah, and I get the emails on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8562)|
| 2:22:43| We send those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| If you would rather have them in hard form, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| We are putting together for next year a dashboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| that will give you those numbers real quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| and then if you want detail, that will be behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| What we've been sending you all is detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| and it's really quite cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8581)|
| 2:23:02| But it's thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| We'll go for shorter and complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| So then I want a couple of questions about your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8590)|
| 2:23:13| which you have here, $2,250,000, rough numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8593)|
| 2:23:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| I know there's, are you all sharing that space with WDVX?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8601)|
| 2:23:26| We provide that space at no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| Okay, so that's built into your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| Yes, and we have a wonderful relationship with them, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| and in terms of they mentioned Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:40| the Visitor Center come on down on their broadcast 24 hours a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8620)|
| 2:23:44| and we have then the daily, the live music show at noon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| which our meeting planners and people that we're bringing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8629)|
| 2:23:53| to try and impress does a heck of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| It's always very crowded, very festive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| and it's just a good spirit type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| When you come in there, it's like here are the crafts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8640)|
| 2:24:05| the arts and crafts of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| Here's the music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| I mean, so it really helps us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| I mean, it's a cultural thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| It's saying this is East Tennessee, this is our culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| And what we're adding, we've got in our capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| is to spruce up the Visitor Center even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8658)|
| 2:24:21| is to have ongoing videos to where if someone comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:26| and pushes a button, we've got a video of actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| if you went to the zoo, this is what it would be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| If you went to Mabry-Hazen House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| if you went to Beck Cultural Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| we have in-depth videos so the visitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| then can take the maps that we give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| but they've got a flavor of what it's going to be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| and those are only not for profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| So we get mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| The Three Rivers Ramblers gets mad at us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| because we don't do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8688)|
| 2:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| But, you know, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| And let me say one thing about the Hall of Fame, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| That $150,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8696)|
| 2:24:57| You want me to stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8697)|
| 2:24:58| Well, I just didn't want to leave that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| And so could you let me know and I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| if you have that number at your disposal now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| what the cost of that space would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8706)|
| 2:25:09| what your cost for that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| If you don't have it right now, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| No, I think, Linda, don't we swap out $2,000 a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| I think we swap $2,000 a month, swap out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| So we provide them the studio space for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| to do the broadcast, the broadcast studio itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8722)|
| 2:25:25| and then their business offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| and they get two parking permits, two parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:32| and we argue more over that than we do over the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| And they pay $2,000 for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| They give us in exchange for that $2,000 of advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| on their station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| But there's no real dollars that change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| Okay, so go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8746)|
| 2:25:47| On the women's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:48| On the Hall of Fame, the $150,000 is a contract service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8748)|
| 2:25:54| to provide similar to what a PBA would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| for any other county-owned facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| They provide the outside maintenance, upkeep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8759)|
| 2:26:02| the agricultural, the inside, the insurance, the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| I have a list of that if you all would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| of all the things that we're responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| in exchange for that because it is a county-owned facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| And we are basically the, we're PBA Junior for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| So we have, the Hall of Fame has never requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8780)|
| 2:26:23| any community grant funding or hotel motel tax funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| But we just, you know, we're able to generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| And I also, Mike, if you want me to give that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| in terms of what our, I feel like I'm hogging the mic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8796)|
| 2:26:41| and I'll be glad to sit down at any point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:44| No, Jolie, could you help her distribute those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| Yes, if you would, let's distribute those, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| so they have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| What happened to Kathy Quist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| She was here for two seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:58| I'll take some for this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| Okay, now wait just a minute before you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| Okay, wait just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| Okay, and I guess just while you're doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:11| the general question, maybe it's for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:15| And it's back on the allocation of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| And this came out of, Amy and I had a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| one day last week, Tuesday, Wednesday, I forgot the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| And I don't know if this is accurate or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| so I'll just put the statement out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| that East Tennessee History Center gets money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| out of the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| You don't have to come to the mic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| but whenever you answer that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| the number of $200,000 for the East Tennessee History Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| comes out of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| So I'm just trying to figure out how these numbers are adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| Okay, what I passed out was the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| that we have is the basic taking care of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| In the 10 years, I guess, that we've been doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8879)|
| 2:28:03| we have paid for all repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| Anything that goes there, we're paying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| And the county does own the facility and the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:14| At the end of the year, the contract also calls for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| to pay them any net income that we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| of revenue less expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| And you will see there on the schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| what we've been paying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| So we're basically a break-even type organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| Anywhere, I think our lowest was $900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| One year, our highest was $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| So, Gloria, according to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| you pay for the utilities and the cleaning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| That's sort of following up with what Sam had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| Just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| $200,000 goes to East Tennessee Historical Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8934)|
| 2:28:59| Where does it come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| I mean, I don't see where it could come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| The budget book says $15,000, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8943)|
| 2:29:06| I'm just going off the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8946)|
| 2:29:08| I don't have that in my numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| I'm out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8952)|
| 2:29:13| I just don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8953)|
| 2:29:14| I mean, there's limited funding, and I don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| It couldn't come from the tourist-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| There's only $250,000 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| Mr. Troyer, could you enlighten us on the East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| just so we have the accurate numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| Am I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| Yeah, I think you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| Thanks, Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8967)|
| 2:29:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8968)|
| 2:29:32| One of the things, the county does own that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| and the facility costs have been in years past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8976)|
| 2:29:40| charged to the hotel and motel for what it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8980)|
| 2:29:44| to keep the lights on and security and utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8984)|
| 2:29:50| That's East Tennessee Historical Society billing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8990)|
| 2:29:53| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| Is that the situation going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| The county will be paying that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| Is that standalone, or is that in the library budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9003)|
| 2:30:07| It is supplement to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| It is a sub-function of the libraries, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| Okay, so it's in the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| To find it, you have to go to the library's budget to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9016)|
| 2:30:19| But it's funded out of where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9019)|
| 2:30:22| We get funding out of the hotel and motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| to fund that to the library's budget, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9024)|
| 2:30:28| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9028)|
| 2:30:30| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| $5 million of which $2 million to Knox County for dead service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9033)|
| 2:30:39| $500,000 Knox County to give to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| $250,000 for tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| I don't see where we could get $200,000 out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| Is it out of the debt service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9049)|
| 2:30:53| No, it wouldn't be debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:54| You said operations, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| Yes, and to go back to, we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| I came prepared to talk about the finance department budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9059)|
| 2:31:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9062)|
| 2:31:03| I don't mean to put you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9063)|
| 2:31:04| I'd like to spell this out for you on a sheet of paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| rather than in a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| Well, I'd like to support all of these entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9070)|
| 2:31:13| but that just doesn't sound logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9073)|
| 2:31:16| The $200,000 of hotel and motel goes to historical society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| I question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| We're going to take a quick break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| and when we return, we'll hear from Mark Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| the president of the FOP, and then Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| Then we have Grant Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| If there's anyone else here who wants to address us on the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:38| would you see me during the break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| Because we don't want to slight you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| We do have a public hearing at 630,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| but if you're here, we'd like to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| that you're on the list so that you're not slighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| So we'll be back in about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| We'll make sure the mayor's on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9112)|
| 2:31:53| So we'll be back in approximately ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9113)|
| 2:31:56| We're back into session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| and the first person I'd like to call on is Mark Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| who is president of the FOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| If you'd come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| any remarks that you'd like to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| and we may have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| We appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9129)|
| 2:32:10| If you'd give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9130)|
| 2:32:15| My name is Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9135)|
| 2:32:16| I'm the president of the Fraternal Order of Police Volunteer Lodge 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| 720 Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9139)|
| 2:32:22| And I'm here on behalf of the FOP members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| and Knox County Sheriff's Office deputies that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9145)|
| 2:32:29| many of them who have been on shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| and already serve the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9152)|
| 2:32:34| and are still here because this matter is important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| I know I've had the opportunity to speak to many of you individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9157)|
| 2:32:42| at different times about issues that are central to police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9162)|
| 2:32:46| and important to the FOP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| and I appreciate your letting me speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| I think Commissioner Boyles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| she had made some comments about inherent worth and dignity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9175)|
| 2:32:59| this morning with folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| and then that was echoed by Judge McGee and Judge Cerny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9181)|
| 2:33:05| out of drug court about folks that were coming through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| some of the offenders who were coming through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9188)|
| 2:33:12| those folks still have an inherent worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| and being treated with respect and dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| And I think those, as I thought about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9196)|
| 2:33:18| I was listening to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9198)|
| 2:33:19| that's perfect for law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| because nobody knows better than that deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9201)|
| 2:33:25| or that officer out there on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| who are seeing people in their worst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| and dealing with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| and still treating them with respect and dignity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| even though they may not be treating us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| The economy's been bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9217)|
| 2:33:40| We see that kind of turning around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| Some, I know there's been some positive stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| on that recently that I've looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| But over the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| the Knox County Sheriff's Office employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| haven't received a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| And some of those employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| are some of Knox County's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9237)|
| 2:34:00| most financially vulnerable citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9240)|
| 2:34:04| So with the tough times that we've experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9244)|
| 2:34:09| and that they've saw us through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9249)|
| 2:34:13| it's maybe not as much of a known fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| but violence has increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| towards police officers a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:18| I was up in D.C. last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| for the National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9260)|
| 2:34:24| and there was a stunning increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| in line-of-duty deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9267)|
| 2:34:28| of police officers around the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| They added 152 names to the wall this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| It's a big increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9273)|
| 2:34:34| And what's more disturbing than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| they've added a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| because of increasing gun violence deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| Whereas traffic accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| might have been one of the leading causes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| gun violence against law enforcement officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| and the job they're doing out here daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| has went up dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| And this year, it looks to be even worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| if the trend continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9293)|
| 2:34:54| It's a pace setting even above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| With that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| these officers that are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9300)|
| 2:35:03| have been doing an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:05| I think there have been recent articles on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9305)|
| 2:35:08| I know that any part of economic recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| or really any part of governance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| is based on rule of law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| and they provide that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:18| They do an exceptional job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| Crime rates figure into growth and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9320)|
| 2:35:23| and these guys have done a top-notch job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9323)|
| 2:35:26| So what I would say to you is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| These guys are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| And I know when you look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| from just the financial perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| you're like, how do I justify this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| Or how do I, during these tough times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9337)|
| 2:35:40| how do I say that I can get more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| But I would tell you that these employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| are a valuable resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| They're already performing for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| for the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| And they've been performing under some of the worst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9350)|
| 2:35:53| and most trying times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| arguably, in our nation's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9355)|
| 2:35:58| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| And just to give you a comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| of what a resource you have there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| I think that the employees of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| haven't had a raise since July of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| I think was the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| During that period in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| their counterparts, just for maybe a local example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9373)|
| 2:36:16| at the city have had an average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| of a 3.7 raise each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9378)|
| 2:36:21| in 2008, 2009, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| And that was part of the Mercer study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| that was done of all law enforcement comparables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| I think about 150 agencies were represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9389)|
| 2:36:32| A very regimented study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| that the mayor of the city undertook at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9394)|
| 2:36:37| And then in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| we're scheduled to receive a 2.5% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9400)|
| 2:36:44| During that same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9404)|
| 2:36:46| the Knox County Sheriff's Office employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9406)|
| 2:36:48| haven't received a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| So I'm here on behalf of these employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9410)|
| 2:36:53| to ask you to look at that seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9413)|
| 2:36:57| and to give them consideration in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| They work hard for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| They absolutely take pride in what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9423)|
| 2:37:06| And that's evidenced by their actions every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9426)|
| 2:37:10| They're also very giving people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| They work in the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9432)|
| 2:37:14| They're laying the blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9434)|
| 2:37:16| that are going to make Knox County strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9436)|
| 2:37:19| They're laying the blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| that your vision will be built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9441)|
| 2:37:24| And I would like for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9444)|
| 2:37:26| to give that good consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9446)|
| 2:37:29| And I appreciate any consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| you give them in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| for helping with the raise for them this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| Is Frances out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9460)|
| 2:37:42| She's still in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9462)|
| 2:37:44| You don't need to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| Frances, could you check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| and just check in the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| and see the population we have here in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| and compare that to others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| and tell us where we are pay scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| versus what we have for the Knox County officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9477)|
| 2:38:00| Let us know where we are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| Are we way behind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| Are we way ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| Are we average with everybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| You can just e-mail that to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| as close as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| And we thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| Men and women do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| And with your leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| and with JJ's leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| I always appreciate everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| that the Sheriff's Department does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| I'll try to be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| I'm also here advocating a pay raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| for all Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| The last three years since July the 1st, 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| we haven't even talked about raises for employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| We know times are tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| and that's why we've not addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| But we feel now is the time to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| I even hesitate to call it pay raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9538)|
| 2:39:00| I think it's recovering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| from what we've lost in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| One of our insurance plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9544)|
| 2:39:06| has gone up 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| The other one's gone up 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| When officers look at their checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| and see it decreasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| that's not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| And that's been the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9556)|
| 2:39:18| we've been in for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| So I've passed out some figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| on the percentage of what it costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| for the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| and about the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| But let there be no mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9568)|
| 2:39:29| we're talking about a pay raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| for all Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| Sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| the 2% raise here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| like 873,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| is that just for Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| The numbers I've passed out to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| are just Sheriff's Office numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9589)|
| 2:39:51| I did speak with Ms. Acuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| last week on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| And if we went with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| all employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| it's like a million dollars per percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| plus benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| So if you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| 1% across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| it's a million dollars plus the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| I think if you do 3%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| it's like 3.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| for all Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| You know, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| and I don't know how we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| with the Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| in that this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| should be that we're entering into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| and I think that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| We're having a conversation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9635)|
| 2:40:37| about the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| and I do agree with Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| that we need to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| what the need is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| So I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| and maybe Francis could just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| get us a ballpark figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| on what it would cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9651)|
| 2:40:53| but what I'd like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| is look at that comprehensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| and I turned my light off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| when the gentleman from FOP was talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| It's not just flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| I mean, it's flat minus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| health coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| Other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| have gone up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| So what I'd like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| is figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| what it would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| to get, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| 7 or 8 jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9679)|
| 2:41:21| pay grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| pay slots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| maybe do a max min| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| of one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| and incorporate the benefit cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| because it may not cost as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| in Augusta, Georgia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| for health as it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| So I'd like to do more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| of a comprehensive look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| and see where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| Where's the Sheriff Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| Where's the Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| Where's Public Works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| How are we paying our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| just to give us an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| of what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| and are we looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| an automatic escalator or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| like what the city has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| I want to get a snapshot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| of where we are 2011, 2012 time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9726)|
| 2:42:08| So I don't know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| we would move out on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9730)|
| 2:42:12| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| Maybe just like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9734)|
| 2:42:16| just an idea of what it would cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9736)|
| 2:42:18| and then we could handle it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| In one sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| we do have an automatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| one I mentioned earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| where so often they get longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| and they get step raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| So that is a compensation package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| That's supposed to be automatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9752)|
| 2:42:34| but we've not been able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| But it's put you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9756)|
| 2:42:38| So now we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9758)|
| 2:42:40| That was probably done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9760)|
| 2:42:42| based on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| And it was a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| It was a good plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| but it's just not been followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| It was one of the first things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9770)|
| 2:42:52| that was always cut out of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9774)|
| 2:42:56| You see the increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| that the state employees get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9778)|
| 2:43:00| and you see the increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9780)|
| 2:43:02| that the teachers get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| and then our men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9784)|
| 2:43:06| and employees in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| don't get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| That's a tough pill to swallow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| and they work very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| And just to be totally clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9794)|
| 2:43:16| I think we need to evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9796)|
| 2:43:18| again, look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| no one is passing any legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| or doing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| I think within that same conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| that's a benefit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| So that needs to be injected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9808)|
| 2:43:30| in there and needs to enter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| into the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| about how we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9814)|
| 2:43:36| Francis, you don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| Could you get us this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| by June the 6th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| She says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9826)|
| 2:43:48| I talked in the chairman's luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| about us having a work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| where we roll up our sleeves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| and really start drilling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9834)|
| 2:43:55| at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| This room is available then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| and other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| we're running into all kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| of conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| So I know that that may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| work for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| but if we could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| that discussion at June 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| at 5 o'clock here in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| Actually, Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| and I had a sunshine meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| last week that several members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| of the board had with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| from finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| And one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| that we had discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| and Sam and I may need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| to do this as a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| before the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| about it would be very helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| to have an independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| third-party organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| come in and do a salary study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| that's not just the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| department but the entire county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| so that we can see where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| we stack up in relation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| to this area as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| as non-profits and private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| So I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9901)|
| 2:45:03| I don't think there's no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| that we can get that done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| before this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| but if we start on that soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| we can use it to inform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| next year's budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| So I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| And one of the points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| that I have been making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| is that when I talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| about a 3% raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| for county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| it might be better to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| at it in terms of step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| and that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| that I'm going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| looking at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| I'm going to keep an open mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| about that and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| if that would work more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| with the program we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| in place that we're supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| to be following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| But when you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| at so many county employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| who make less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110523part1?start=9953)|
