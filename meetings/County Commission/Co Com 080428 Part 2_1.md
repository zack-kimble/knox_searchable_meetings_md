| 2:34:19| What you have before you is an ordinance on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9259)|
| 2:34:24| which will give you a procedure for not only issuing but for enforcing a subpoena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9264)|
| 2:34:33| that is issued pursuant to your authority under 2.02H of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9273)|
| 2:34:40| If you have any specific questions, I'll be glad to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9280)|
| 2:34:44| But it is, I think, pretty self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9284)|
| 2:34:50| But it goes through the procedure for both authorizing the subpoena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9290)|
| 2:34:59| as well as if the subpoena is not honored for enforcing the subpoena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9299)|
| 2:35:07| What is the penalty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| Ultimately, the punishment would be contempt of court if the subpoena is not honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9311)|
| 2:35:18| The subpoena would, first of all, be issued through the court of General Sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9318)|
| 2:35:25| and it would be enforced through that court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| Do we have a motion yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| Before we vote on this, this is the first reading of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9336)|
| 2:35:42| Would it be possible to amend this, if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9342)|
| 2:35:47| to have the second reading during the Finance and Intergovernmental Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9347)|
| 2:35:53| have the second reading on it to where we could use this possibly the 19th if we have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9353)|
| 2:36:00| Well, it would be too late to issue subpoenas on that day, would it not, Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9360)|
| 2:36:06| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9366)|
| 2:36:07| We just need a special call meeting or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| Well, I mean, we have a special call meeting for the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| Even if we had a special meeting to approve this on second reading on the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9372)|
| 2:36:18| I don't think that you could then turn around and issue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| We wouldn't have enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9380)|
| 2:36:21| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9381)|
| 2:36:22| So we need to have a special call meeting before that, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| It has to be signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9384)|
| 2:36:26| If we can, because this isn't going to do us any good to have these powers if we can't invoke them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9386)|
| 2:36:32| Well, it's like the law director was saying here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| It still has to be, even after we approve anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| it has to still be signed by the mayor and then signed off by the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9398)|
| 2:36:42| So it would still take some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| and I don't know if we'd have time to have a special meeting between now and the 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| that would give us that time to be able to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9409)|
| 2:36:53| You need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9413)|
| 2:36:54| I was told by the clerk that it takes 15 days for it to go into effect after being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9414)|
| 2:37:01| Mr. Chairman, let me also say what we're doing on the 19th is not a 202H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9421)|
| 2:37:05| What we're doing on the 19th is we're going to listen to what is being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| and then we are determined what action we want to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9429)|
| 2:37:11| We could very well say we want a 202H, and at that time this would be in effect or could be in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9431)|
| 2:37:19| That's true, but we've been trying to get this since September of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| That's how long we've been trying to get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| Now it comes up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9445)|
| 2:37:26| If we don't have the meetings and discussions, the subpoena power is going to be no good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9446)|
| 2:37:32| If people already said they would not come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| that's been in the paper that some of them have said they would not show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| So we should have had this earlier, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| But if we decide to do a 202H and our meeting is the 19th and possibly the 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| this would be in effect, or couldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9469)|
| 2:37:56| I was just trying to get over the last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9476)|
| 2:38:02| An ordinance for it to take effect would need to be certainly to be signed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9482)|
| 2:38:07| The mayor has an opportunity to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| He's got 14 days to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9489)|
| 2:38:15| If the mayor wished to sign it, it would go into law upon his signature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| but he also has the ability to veto a matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9499)|
| 2:38:24| And so it takes due consideration by the administration before it goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9504)|
| 2:38:32| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9512)|
| 2:38:38| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| Yes, just a quick note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9520)|
| 2:38:43| Subpoena power is one thing, but, you know, if we have some questions for people on the 19th, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9523)|
| 2:38:50| I guess we could still put them under oath if we chose to do so, couldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9530)|
| 2:38:56| Yeah, there's a difference of opinion on that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| But I believe that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9539)|
| 2:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9543)|
| 2:39:04| I believe that this commission can put a person under oath to speak to the county commission under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9544)|
| 2:39:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9553)|
| 2:39:14| Just wanted to let everybody know that I think we have that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| And we, without question, we have that power in the 202H investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9557)|
| 2:39:28| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9570)|

| 2:39:39| Chairman, I just want to say thank you to the law director for coming up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9579)|
| 2:39:44| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9584)|
| 2:39:45| Thank you, Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| Tell your partner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9587)|
| 2:39:54| She accomplished something that Lee Trimble and the 11-man commission couldn't accomplish in nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9594)|
| 2:40:00| She's a whole lot better looking than you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9600)|
| 2:40:02| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9602)|
| 2:40:03| For the record, she's a lot prettier than Lee Trimble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| We did vote on that in September of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9608)|

| 2:41:09| Yeah, I think we're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9669)|

| 2:41:15| I'm going to have a roll call for a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| Do you really need a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| If we could do five minutes and no more, I think that would be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9683)|
| 2:41:26| If we could just say five minutes and we'll be back at 737.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| Five minutes break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| 8-0 for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9691)|
| 2:41:50| We're ready to start back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| The Commission Chair has granted me one little favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9714)|
| 2:41:58| I get to tell my grandson, Justin, good night, because he's watching the TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9718)|
| 2:42:04| And I usually read him a bedtime story, but I don't think you all want to hear about the three little billy goats gruff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9724)|
| 2:42:11| So good night, Justin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9731)|
| 2:42:12| Good night, Justin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| It's okay, Mary Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9734)|
| 2:42:15| We'll put him to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| If he's watching, he should be asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9738)|
| 2:42:27| Mr. Chairman, we're on the all these amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9747)|
| 2:42:34| Are they a way that I could make a motion we put all these together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9754)|
| 2:42:39| We've got to take them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| I think you need to read the caption of each one individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9762)|
| 2:42:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| Ordinances do require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9768)|
| 2:42:54| I'm just trying to speed us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| I like your thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| We talked for an hour about speeding up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| Read the caption on page 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9787)|

| 2:43:39| and change the number of commission seats per district to one per district and to align the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9819)|
| 2:43:45| No, we just need the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9825)|

| 2:44:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9852)|
| 2:44:14| 1-0-1, on the top of page 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| This is the number for petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9857)|
| 2:44:22| We're changing it to what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9862)|
| 2:44:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| This is what the charter already says to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| That might work then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| I was going to ask, Mary Ann, is the language that we received from the charter group from Mr. Owings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9875)|
| 2:44:43| apparently the two sides have gotten together, and is this language substantially different from the first reading, or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9883)|
| 2:44:52| The reason I ask if it's substantially different, we have to vote it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| If not, we can continue on with second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| I don't think there was any change to 1-0-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9902)|
| 2:45:03| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| Commissioner Luthold, would you like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9906)|
| 2:45:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| Maybe, but I'll give it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| How much will this cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9921)|
| 2:45:22| I mean, Commissioner Luthold has already said that this is already in our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9922)|
| 2:45:27| So, by voting on this, how much will it cost to go on the ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9927)|
| 2:45:34| The question is, why put something on the ballot to change it to what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9934)|
| 2:45:38| Because state law is one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| What we have in our charter is different, and they're wanting to change it to what our charter already says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9941)|
| 2:45:49| So, if it's 15% of the guberatorial count versus 15% of the countywide registered voters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9949)|
| 2:46:03| I just don't understand why this is even before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| Mr. McAdams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| My name is Tom McAdams, 4823 Old Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| Mr. Luthold is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9973)|
| 2:46:14| That is what your charter originally provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| After the adoption of your charter, though, the state legislature adopted a new law that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9977)|
| 2:46:23| notwithstanding what any county charter says, we're changing the law to up the number of signatures that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9983)|
| 2:46:32| But that statute has a provision in it that says if a county wants to have a lower number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9992)|
| 2:46:38| then it can amend its charter to go back to the lower number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=9998)|
| 2:46:42| But you have to do that amendment after the date that the state legislature adopted its legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10002)|
| 2:46:50| So, you used to have a lower number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| The state legislature changed it but gave you authority to go back to a lower number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10012)|
| 2:46:58| To do that, you have to amend your charter to go back to the lower number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10018)|
| 2:47:02| So, we have to amend our charter to what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| You're amending it, but the effective date is the key thing, that you'll have an effective date after the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10025)|
| 2:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10035)|
| 2:47:18| Commissioner Ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10038)|
| 2:47:19| I don't think the Commissioner agrees with this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10039)|
| 2:47:21| That's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10041)|
| 2:47:22| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10042)|
| 2:47:23| Well, I think what I was going to ask is my understanding, because I brought it up here before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10043)|
| 2:47:29| is that if the Commission puts it on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10049)|
| 2:47:31| there's no cost because the Election Commission doesn't have to verify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10051)|
| 2:47:36| And then if it's put on by charter, I mean by petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10056)|
| 2:47:40| then it's approximately a dollar vote or $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10060)|
| 2:47:46| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10066)|
| 2:47:47| That's what I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| It takes about a dollar per signature for the Election Commission to verify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10069)|
| 2:47:55| I mean, our charter says 15% of the last gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10075)|
| 2:48:01| And I guess if we want to be able to make it right and be able to use what our charter says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10081)|
| 2:48:06| we have to change it to what it is because of the effective date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10086)|
| 2:48:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| And this is the cheap way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10096)|
| 2:48:19| The expensive way to do it is to do it by petition drive, which requires them to count the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10099)|
| 2:48:25| On this one, you simply add it to the ballot of an existing election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| so very little incremental cost for adding it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10109)|
| 2:48:33| So while you're there, how many signatures will you need to put something on the ballot if we pass this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10113)|
| 2:48:40| Well, it will vary depending on the number of voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10120)|
| 2:48:46| Every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10126)|
| 2:48:47| Previous election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10127)|
| 2:48:49| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10129)|
| 2:48:50| The gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10131)|
| 2:48:52| The past gubernatorial election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10132)|
| 2:48:53| Oh, I'm not sure what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| It's the gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| Forty thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10137)|
| 2:49:00| Fifteen percent of the gubernatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10140)|
| 2:49:02| Do we know what the last gubernatorial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| It's 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10145)|
| 2:49:07| No, more than 40,000 would have voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10147)|
| 2:49:10| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| I think it's 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10151)|
| 2:49:12| If we don't, if we had to follow 15% of the total registered voters, it would be lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10152)|
| 2:49:20| But Mr. Tulloch indicates that under existing law, it would take approximately 40,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10160)|
| 2:49:25| Under the revised law, it would take about 15,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10165)|
| 2:49:29| So it would drop from 40,000 to 15,000 with this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10169)|
| 2:49:34| So the answer is it must be 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10174)|
| 2:49:37| My question is, Mary Ann Stackhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10177)|
| 2:49:40| could there be other items in our charter that maybe we just need to come up with some language then to correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10180)|
| 2:49:47| Would there be a number of these issues in our charter that we would need to correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10187)|
| 2:49:56| You mean where there's been an intervening state law that has somehow rendered void something that's in the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10196)|
| 2:50:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10203)|
| 2:50:04| As I sit here right now, I can't think of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| I just want to say while there's a lot of things that this organization has brought forward that I'm against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10215)|
| 2:50:22| this is one thing that I'm for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10222)|
| 2:50:24| This puts us back under the standard that we were under when we had the wheel tax petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10224)|
| 2:50:31| It was by no means easy to get those signatures, but it was possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| As it stands now, it is not possible for a small grassroots organization to get enough signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10236)|
| 2:50:43| It puts it to where the only organizations that are able to petition their government essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10243)|
| 2:50:50| are folks that can afford to hire professional companies to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10250)|
| 2:50:55| So I'm going to support this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| I think it was a reasonable expectation before the number of signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10257)|
| 2:51:03| and I think we should go back to that reasonable number if there's any way we can within the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10263)|
| 2:51:13| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| I think the motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10275)|
| 2:51:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10280)|
| 2:51:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| There's one that's going on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10283)|
| 2:51:26| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| That sounds like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| That's going on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| 0-0-08-2-102 is amending Article 2, Article 6, and Article 9 of the Knox County Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10293)|
| 2:51:42| to add two at-large county commission member seats, to change the number of commission seats per district to one per district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10302)|
| 2:51:49| and to align the Board of Education districts and commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10309)|
| 2:51:53| Knox County Charter is adopted November 8th, 1988, as amended through referendum of November 8th, 1994,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10313)|
| 2:52:01| August 1st, 1996, and August 6th, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10321)|
| 2:52:07| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| Voted 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10329)|

| 2:52:13| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10333)|
| 2:52:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10335)|
| 2:52:16| Got a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10336)|
| 2:52:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| We have a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10341)|
| 2:52:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10342)|
| 2:52:23| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10343)|
| 2:52:24| We have a second to the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10344)|
| 2:52:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10346)|
| 2:52:27| Well, I'll say it after we, depending on how the vote goes on the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10347)|
| 2:52:34| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10354)|
| 2:52:35| I'll say my comments to see how we vote on the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10355)|
| 2:52:39| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10359)|
| 2:52:43| Again, I would ask the law director, with the language that we had received from the charter group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10363)|
| 2:52:50| and the law director, in your opinion, did it substantially change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10370)|
| 2:52:57| I think it may well have substantially changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| I will say that the deletions certainly made it more clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10380)|
| 2:53:05| and raised less questions about how to conduct the reapportionment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10385)|
| 2:53:12| But it may have substantially changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10392)|
| 2:53:18| Use the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10398)|
| 2:53:20| I do think it may have substantially changed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10400)|
| 2:53:23| although the changes certainly made it more clear as to how the reapportionment would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10403)|
| 2:53:32| So, in your opinion, we would not be able to vote on this on second reading tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10412)|
| 2:53:36| I think out of an abundance of caution, I would treat this as a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10416)|
| 2:53:42| Isn't there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10422)|
| 2:53:44| You know, I am against this, but I'm not against people voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10424)|
| 2:53:51| I did an analysis last year of the number of times I came to this building, and I was here 70 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10431)|
| 2:53:57| That didn't include board meetings, homeowner group meetings, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| And I know last year was an anomaly as far as yours are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10441)|
| 2:54:06| My concern is that one person can't do this job and do it justice unless they do it full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10446)|
| 2:54:12| And I'm concerned that we're going to be going toward full time legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| and I don't know that that's what our citizens want if you have just one person trying to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10455)|
| 2:54:20| So, while I'm against it, I'm not against people voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10460)|
| 2:54:24| So, I guess if we need to withdraw, we need to withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10464)|
| 2:54:27| and then perhaps have a motion to do it on first reading or okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10467)|
| 2:54:35| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| Let's do it in first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10480)|
| 2:54:41| Well, I'm going to go ahead and make a substitute motion that this be a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10481)|
| 2:54:47| I think that's a given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| Do we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| Mr. Chairman, I don't think we allow a substitute motion on a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10491)|
| 2:54:55| We had a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| Then we had a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10497)|
| 2:54:59| No, that was a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| I think Commissioner Moore made that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| Did we not have a motion to approve before we had a motion to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10503)|
| 2:55:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10506)|
| 2:55:07| Okay, my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10507)|
| 2:55:17| I was going to bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10517)|
| 2:55:18| I brought it up several times before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| and I don't want us to use this unless we think it's a useful tool to look at these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10521)|
| 2:55:29| and that is having an ad hoc committee appointed to look at the wording on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10529)|
| 2:55:34| And like Commissioner Hammond, I am certainly not taking a side promoting this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10534)|
| 2:55:42| because I have some of the same concerns that he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10542)|
| 2:55:45| But I do want to be certain that if we vote to put one of these amendments on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10545)|
| 2:55:50| that we do have it clear and concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| And I regard our duty as the Knox County Commission is to be certain that we don't have confused wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10552)|
| 2:55:59| any ambiguities, and that there's no unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10559)|
| 2:56:04| And I know those terms have been used a lot on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10564)|
| 2:56:07| And I'm not proposing that we have the ad hoc committee necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10567)|
| 2:56:12| but if we think it would be useful to look at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| and have some members of this commission that have interest in being on that committee serve on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10575)|
| 2:56:23| and then maybe have some members of the charter petition group serve on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| we could bring this back and have it on something we could vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10587)|
| 2:56:32| I'm just throwing that out right now, not even as a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10592)|
| 2:56:36| but just as an option that we might use if there's people that still have concerns about the wording on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10596)|
| 2:56:47| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| I believe that the amendments we're looking at are ones that our law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10609)|
| 2:56:58| and Mr. McAdams had actually wordsmithed prior to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10618)|
| 2:57:03| So I think the ones that we have are ones that have been vetted as well as wordsmithed to have them the way they're written now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10623)|
| 2:57:12| And I think that's what Ms. Stackhouse was referring to as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10632)|
| 2:57:16| that this one in particular has been changed significantly to make it more clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10636)|
| 2:57:22| and possibly even answer the questions of whether or not it was legal or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10642)|
| 2:57:26| Is that correct, Ms. Stackhouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| Well, what this one does in deleting a lot of that language about nonpartisan elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10650)|
| 2:57:39| by deleting all of that, as I read it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| it would certainly return the election of commissioners to partisan elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10663)|
| 2:57:48| In my view, that's a fairly substantial change, which is why I would recommend it be treated as a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10668)|
| 2:57:55| You know, I think that they can be legally correct, but are they something that this commission wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10675)|
| 2:58:01| And in particular, the second part of this deals with realigning the school board with the commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10681)|
| 2:58:08| And I don't know if Cindy Buttrey is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10688)|
| 2:58:11| Yes, she's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10691)|
| 2:58:12| I see her back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10692)|
| 2:58:13| But I've had communication, and even today I've had the chairman of the school board e-mail me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10693)|
| 2:58:20| I've talked with three other school board members in the last couple of days where they have concerns on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| This was not discussed with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| They have not had any input into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| And this was one of the concerns I raised about this particular amendment in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10709)|
| 2:58:34| And I don't know if Ms. Buttrey would like to speak to this or not on behalf of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10714)|
| 2:58:42| Cindy Buttrey, 6404 Ridgewalk Lane, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10722)|
| 2:58:46| Let me just say I am not here on behalf of the school board because we have not discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10726)|
| 2:58:51| So I am here strictly representing myself as a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10731)|
| 2:58:58| There are several issues that I have with this particular amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10738)|
| 2:59:02| Number one, there are two board members at stake that would have to move because of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10742)|
| 2:59:09| because we do not live in our current, we live in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10749)|
| 2:59:15| but we do not live in the commission district that aligns with our school board district number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10755)|
| 2:59:21| So that's the first issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| But the larger issue at stake, I think, for us is, and what I don't think the general public understands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10763)|
| 2:59:29| is most people want to go to, they want their kids to go to a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10769)|
| 2:59:35| and have that board member be the person that represents them for whatever school their child goes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10775)|
| 2:59:44| Even if you were to realign our districts to match, it still would not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10784)|
| 2:59:51| For instance, and I'll give you an example, Ball Camp Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10791)|
| 2:59:56| which is in the 6th commission district and is served by the 6th school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10796)|
| 3:00:03| 6th district school board member, Ball Camp Elementary School feeds to two different middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10803)|
| 3:00:10| It feeds to Carnes Middle School, which is in the 6th commission district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10810)|
| 3:00:15| but it also feeds to Cedar Bluff Middle School, which is in the 5th commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10815)|
| 3:00:21| And then Cedar Bluff feeds back into the 6th commission district next year at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10821)|
| 3:00:31| So unless you're willing to take a look and really work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10831)|
| 3:00:38| and the only way you can do that would be during a redistricting, a massive redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| which is really not going to take place until probably 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10844)|
| 3:00:50| there's really no way to work it so that parents get exactly what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10850)|
| 3:00:56| because you have to consider the school zones when you look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10856)|
| 3:01:01| It's a much broader and deeper issue than just looking at it from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| okay, well, we'll realign ourselves together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10865)|
| 3:01:09| And if you look at where we are aligned, for the most part, we are aligned together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10869)|
| 3:01:15| I did the numbers and looked at our numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10875)|
| 3:01:19| We are, at least in the county for the large part, coalescent with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10879)|
| 3:01:26| I think Carnes and maybe a little bit of Powell is the only places in a portion of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10886)|
| 3:01:33| which is where Mr. Deakins and I are not, are aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10893)|
| 3:01:38| But the third district that I represent, it goes into the 2nd commission district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10898)|
| 3:01:45| the 3rd commission district, and the 6th commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10905)|
| 3:01:49| And I will say that this body did approve that because you all have to approve our redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10909)|
| 3:01:58| So even though you all may not have been on there when it was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| the commission does have to approve whatever redistricting is proposed by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10921)|
| 3:02:08| So those things can be worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| but it's just not going to be possible until the next census, which is in 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| which usually doesn't go into effect until the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10935)|
| 3:02:18| Please correct me if I'm wrong, Marianne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| Until the next election, which would be 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10941)|
| 3:02:24| So that's where we're coming from, or at least I'm coming from on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10944)|
| 3:02:30| I don't care at all to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10950)|
| 3:02:31| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10951)|
| 3:02:32| That's, you know, a moot point for all practical purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10952)|
| 3:02:36| But I just wanted you all to be aware that it is a much more complicated issue than just realigning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10956)|
| 3:02:45| and that the public has they don't even realize that it's a lot bigger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10965)|
| 3:02:54| And they may not get what they want in the end, even if this does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| Ms. Buttry, I do think you raise an interesting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| Your dilemma may also be faced by members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10982)|
| 3:03:06| If this amendment were to pass and we had nine single-member districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10986)|
| 3:03:13| there would have to be reapportionment, if I understand things correctly, prior to the 2010 election for the 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=10993)|
| 3:03:25| and then after the 2010 sentence, we would be required to reapportion again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11005)|
| 3:03:32| And a commissioner, if my understanding of the timing is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11012)|
| 3:03:37| might find himself or herself no longer in their district as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11017)|
| 3:03:43| Because were this to pass this year, as I understand it, if it's going to take effect in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11023)|
| 3:03:51| then presumably we're going to find ourselves dealing with sort of two reapportionments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11031)|
| 3:03:58| unless the authors of this amendment have a different view of how it's to be understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11038)|
| 3:04:05| But when I read it, I see two reapportionments happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11045)|
| 3:04:10| One in early 2009 based on the 2000 census for the elections of 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11050)|
| 3:04:17| and then one by the end of 2011 for the elections of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11057)|
| 3:04:24| And the one provision this doesn't seem to contain is what do we do in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11064)|
| 3:04:29| Now, if the authors of the amendment interpret their amendment differently, we can certainly hear them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11069)|
| 3:04:37| But that's the way I see it as I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11077)|
| 3:04:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11083)|
| 3:04:47| The purpose of the change in that section was to avoid that very problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11087)|
| 3:04:51| and we do interpret the amendment differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11091)|
| 3:04:54| Previously, it would have required a realignment prior to 2010, and that section was taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11094)|
| 3:05:04| There was language that made it revert back to the 1989 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11104)|
| 3:05:07| That was deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11107)|
| 3:05:09| So the districts stay exactly like they are until county commission realigns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11109)|
| 3:05:14| and it realigns at the same time that you realign your own districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11114)|
| 3:05:19| which are required to do after the 2010 census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11119)|
| 3:05:23| So we think, as amended, there would be no change at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11123)|
| 3:05:27| I think Ms. Bettry was exactly right that the first election it would impact would be 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11127)|
| 3:05:34| Tom, let me ask you about that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| I mean, as I read the amendment saying that when we look at Section 2, Paragraph A-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11136)|
| 3:05:49| the commission under this charter shall consist of nine members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| and then it does turn them into single-member districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11152)|
| 3:05:57| When you go over onto the next part, it talks about the regular terms of commission members shall be four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11157)|
| 3:06:04| but then it delineates certain commission districts that will have an initial extended term for six years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11164)|
| 3:06:12| and then four because there's an effort to have a stagger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11172)|
| 3:06:16| And then it says, you see toward the end of that sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11176)|
| 3:06:19| it says shall be elected in the county primary and general election of 2010 and every four years thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11179)|
| 3:06:27| It seems to me, though, that this single-member district is being created for the 2010 elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11187)|
| 3:06:39| I think the districts remain exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11199)|
| 3:06:43| There's just one commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11203)|
| 3:06:44| But, see, that's where we're going to have the constitutional problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11204)|
| 3:06:48| because if we don't reapportion the nine districts, then, in my view, you have the fifth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11208)|
| 3:06:59| which by its very population nature is going to be underrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11219)|
| 3:07:06| It's going to go from three representatives to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11226)|
| 3:07:10| By the very lines of that district right now, the people in District 5 are not going to have equal protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11230)|
| 3:07:25| equal representation because you're going from a three-member district to a one-member district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11245)|
| 3:07:32| And if the lines are not redrawn before the 2010 election, I think there are some serious constitutional issues about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11252)|
| 3:07:43| And that's why I always anticipated there would have to be two reapportionments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11263)|
| 3:07:48| one for 2010 based on the 2000 census and then turn right around and have to reapportion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11268)|
| 3:07:55| or check the reapportionment based on the 2010 census for the 2012 election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11275)|
| 3:08:04| But I don't think you can keep the lines the same for the 2010 election if you're going to single-member districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11284)|
| 3:08:13| And we're going to have to be extremely sensitive also to District 1 so that we don't affect the minority vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11293)|
| 3:08:22| and have Voting Rights Act implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11302)|
| 3:08:25| So I find this a very sensitive process that, frankly, if this were to pass in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11305)|
| 3:08:34| in order to meet 2009 deadlines for qualifying, the reapportionment process is going to have to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11314)|
| 3:08:43| almost immediately for study and headcounting the way I've thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11323)|
| 3:08:51| We don't believe that would be required, but we do think to the extent it is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11331)|
| 3:08:55| the county commission would have authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11335)|
| 3:09:00| Other than the reduction, if it was determined as a result of the reduction that a reapportionment was required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11340)|
| 3:09:06| then it could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11346)|
| 3:09:08| Nothing stops it from being able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11348)|
| 3:09:11| This simply does not mandate a time frame for doing that until it would come in the natural course after the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11351)|
| 3:09:19| But if the commission decided it needed to do that, it could certainly do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11359)|
| 3:09:23| I think the commission would almost be required to look at the reapportionment issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11363)|
| 3:09:30| and then I think you can see what my concern is then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11370)|
| 3:09:36| One could wake up in 2011 or early 2012 after the second reapportionment based on the 2010 census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11376)|
| 3:09:49| and no longer live in his or her district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11389)|
| 3:09:53| Because I don't know if things have changed that substantially in the 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11393)|
| 3:09:59| and they may well have in certain parts of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| I do think this is the one amendment that has some significant implications for disenfranchisement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11403)|
| 3:10:12| and we can't let that happen in terms of reapportionment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11412)|
| 3:10:15| I mean, we have to follow the Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| and we have that I think it's a 5% sort of margin of error on population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11417)|
| 3:10:24| That's right, but I think it also anticipates that there will be growth and changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11424)|
| 3:10:28| and that you don't have to reapportion every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11428)|
| 3:10:31| or every time there's a significant change in population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11431)|
| 3:10:34| I think it does permit you to continue with existing districts for a reasonable period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11434)|
| 3:10:41| which is the typical reapportionment period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11441)|
| 3:10:45| You would not be able to use the commission lines because of the fifth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11445)|
| 3:10:51| because we're 50% larger than the other commission districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11451)|
| 3:10:55| You could possibly use the existing school board because they have met the proportion of nine equal districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11455)|
| 3:11:08| Because if you were to use the current fifth district, it was based on approximately 60,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11468)|
| 3:11:14| whereas the other commission districts were approximately 40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11474)|
| 3:11:19| hence keeping the ratio one man, one vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11479)|
| 3:11:22| still being approximately 20,000 or so residents per commissioner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11482)|
| 3:11:34| But I've got other things I want to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11494)|
| 3:11:36| but I think you've got some very serious problems with the reapportionment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11496)|
| 3:11:40| and you could not use the current commission alignment of districts if this were to pass in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11500)|
| 3:11:51| Mr. Chairman, Don Parnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11513)|
| 3:11:54| I was just going to say something that I think is pertinent to the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11514)|
| 3:11:57| 1214 Craig Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11517)|
| 3:12:00| We have included in a previous communication to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11520)|
| 3:12:05| and I think the commission that to the extent that this specific provision creates a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11525)|
| 3:12:11| and it clearly does in a number of minds at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| that we would suggest going forward with the proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11535)|
| 3:12:23| but excluding the coterminous districts of school board and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11543)|
| 3:12:30| It is conceivable at some point in the future that the county might choose to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11550)|
| 3:12:34| but to the extent that alleviates the concerns about one man, one vote and constitutionality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11554)|
| 3:12:42| then we're prepared, as we have indicated before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11562)|
| 3:12:45| to have that part of the language pulled from this particular amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11565)|
| 3:12:51| Out of all the charter amendments, I hate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11571)|
| 3:12:59| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11579)|
| 3:13:02| I don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11582)|
| 3:13:03| I'm not going to be around in 2010, so it doesn't affect me one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11583)|
| 3:13:07| but I understand what we go through daily and we're having one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11587)|
| 3:13:12| And Mr. McAdams, did you ever call the Justice Department on the minority or what they had to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11592)|
| 3:13:22| We did review the law and determined that, in our opinion, it would not result in a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11602)|
| 3:13:28| In your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11608)|
| 3:13:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11609)|
| 3:13:30| That's not what they would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11610)|
| 3:13:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11612)|
| 3:13:33| We did not bring the Justice Department in and ask them to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11613)|
| 3:13:37| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to withdraw my motion that this be on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11617)|
| 3:13:40| It's obvious that we need to look at the language on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11620)|
| 3:13:43| And while I'm not running for reelection either, it would not affect me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11623)|
| 3:13:49| but I do feel an obligation to the citizens of the Fifth District to make sure that what we do is going to be proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11629)|
| 3:13:55| for them from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| So I'm not against people voting on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| but I believe enough questions have been raised that we need the correct wording before I'm comfortable asking that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11639)|
| 3:14:05| this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11645)|
| 3:14:06| So I'm going to withdraw my substitute that we do it on first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11646)|
| 3:14:10| We've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11650)|
| 3:14:12| I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11652)|
| 3:14:18| The original motion is to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11658)|
| 3:14:19| We still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| I will recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11661)|
| 3:14:22| But you've got to call for the question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11662)|
| 3:14:24| I think we have to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| I think the rule said no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11666)|
| 3:14:29| My light was on before the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11669)|
| 3:14:31| I don't think it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11671)|
| 3:14:33| Mrs. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| I think it also says if the maker of the motion withdraws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| he's able to do that without any other vote as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11680)|
| 3:14:45| With a call for the question, you know, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| And it's always been a courtesy for the person who calls for the question to allow those persons to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11690)|
| 3:14:57| But Robert's Rules of Order provides that when there's a call for the question, you vote on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11697)|
| 3:15:04| And if you vote it down, then you obviously go back to the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11704)|
| 3:15:07| And then it can be raised again after everyone's had their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11707)|
| 3:15:13| But the motion is one that cuts off debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11713)|
| 3:15:16| It cuts off everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11716)|
| 3:15:17| And so that's what you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11717)|
| 3:15:21| I have no problem either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| But if it passes this time, it's the way it will be forever while I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11723)|
| 3:15:28| Is it a simple majority or a two-thirds majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11728)|
| 3:15:30| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11730)|
| 3:15:33| Let's vote on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| Did someone second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| It doesn't have to be seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11736)|
| 3:15:37| But my question is, is it a simple majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| I thought we had to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11739)|
| 3:15:40| Is it a two-third vote, John, or a simple majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11740)|
| 3:15:44| We have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| All in favor for cutting off the debate now say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11746)|
| 3:15:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11750)|
| 3:15:51| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11751)|
| 3:15:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11752)|
| 3:15:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11753)|
| 3:15:57| I think we need a roll call, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11757)|
| 3:16:00| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11760)|
| 3:16:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| Mr. Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11763)|

| 3:16:58| Are y'all lights still on for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11818)|
| 3:16:59| Since the call passed, there's no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11819)|
| 3:17:03| There's no discussion on all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11823)|

| 3:17:07| We vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11827)|
| 3:17:08| Just on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11828)|
| 3:17:09| This is on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11829)|
| 3:17:10| Mary Ann, you said no discussion on the new motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11830)|
| 3:17:15| It's a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11835)|
| 3:17:17| It's a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11837)|
| 3:17:18| On with the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11838)|
| 3:17:20| The call for the question is to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11840)|
| 3:17:23| Yeah, this one ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11843)|
| 3:17:27| Commissioner Smith, you still have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| You can't tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11849)|
| 3:17:33| Turn your light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| Mess me up, Commissioner Pinkson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11857)|
| 3:17:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11861)|
| 3:17:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11862)|
| 3:17:44| Who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11864)|
| 3:17:46| Who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11868)|
| 3:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11869)|
| 3:17:50| This motion has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11870)|
| 3:17:53| Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11873)|
| 3:17:54| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11874)|
| 3:18:00| No, you still aren't the one with the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| I was just curious, when you withdraw something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11885)|
| 3:18:07| does that mean it can't be brought back up for 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11887)|
| 3:18:11| Same as a defeat, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11893)|
| 3:18:19| It's been considered by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| It will take a two-thirds majority, which it will take that to pass it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11901)|
| 3:18:26| to get it added back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11906)|
| 3:18:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11909)|
| 3:18:32| You have a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11912)|
| 3:18:33| One of your rules is that if a matter is voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11913)|
| 3:18:37| you just discussed it at length and you voted to withdraw it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11917)|
| 3:18:42| it will take a two-thirds majority to add it within the next 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11922)|
| 3:18:46| I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11926)|
| 3:18:54| It's 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11934)|
| 3:18:55| Commissioner Briggs, do you have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| Yeah, this just gets back to what we're going to do with it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| And this is why I bring up this issue of the ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11940)|
| 3:19:03| There very well may be other amendments that's going to have the same fate as these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11943)|
| 3:19:07| where we had concerns about the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11947)|
| 3:19:11| And, again, just as we go through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11951)|
| 3:19:14| maybe we could decide this at the end whether we want to do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11954)|
| 3:19:17| Otherwise, we're going to be, you know, if it comes back up, we'll be voting on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11957)|
| 3:19:21| Or do we want to work on these to try to fix some of the wording in these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11961)|
| 3:19:27| or do we just want to let it die?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| I mean, I guess that's what the question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| Well, it was my understanding that the wording had been worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11971)|
| 3:19:38| I'd like to address that issue at some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| I mean, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11981)|
| 3:19:42| You can address it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11982)|
| 3:19:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| I like probably a lot here, don't like some of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11985)|
| 3:19:50| but I think some of these as they're presented today is sort of like a novel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11990)|
| 3:19:54| but what's going to be put on the ballot is 300 words or your cliff notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11994)|
| 3:19:59| I sort of like Dr. Briggs' ideals because I like to see what's going on in the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=11999)|
| 3:20:04| for what the people are going to vote on, because it's not going to be all this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12004)|
| 3:20:09| And I think that, you know, comparing cliff notes to novels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| there's a lot in between that's going to be left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12012)|
| 3:20:16| And I like the ad hoc committee or by whatever passes that's coming up for second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12016)|
| 3:20:25| I like to see what exactly is going to go on the ballot for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12025)|
| 3:20:33| Let me just respond to that, if I may, is that, you know, I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12033)|
| 3:20:38| and I appreciate your comments on that, is that when we drop this completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12038)|
| 3:20:43| I believe that the petition group is going to go ahead with the petition process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12043)|
| 3:20:48| You know, I believe them when they say they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12048)|
| 3:20:50| And if they do, we lose complete control of what goes on to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12050)|
| 3:20:55| And, you know, we don't get to vet it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| We don't get to change the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12057)|
| 3:20:58| It doesn't go by our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12058)|
| 3:21:01| And also, it's going to be very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12061)|
| 3:21:03| My understanding is that there's going to be two petitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12063)|
| 3:21:08| and if they indeed get their 80,000 signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12068)|
| 3:21:11| that's $80,000 that we're going to be paying for, we the taxpayers, to verify those signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12071)|
| 3:21:19| And also, we have no control of what those amendments say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12079)|
| 3:21:23| And it's a question, and I disagree with some of the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12083)|
| 3:21:26| but I would like to see them voted on if they're done properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12086)|
| 3:21:32| but I also would like to see this commission maintain some control over what goes on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12092)|
| 3:21:38| I guess I'd like to make that in a form of a motion, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12098)|
| 3:21:42| What was your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| That prior to second reading or the ones that fail, if they come out of ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12104)|
| 3:21:50| how the wording is going to appear on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12110)|
| 3:21:57| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to ask the law director to explain what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| even if a petition group does put a petition together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12121)|
| 3:22:05| and how that would end up on the ballot as far as the wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12125)|
| 3:22:11| Under the law, if the amendment to the charter is greater than 300 words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12131)|
| 3:22:17| then our office is vested with the duty to prepare the ballot question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12137)|
| 3:22:24| which has to be less than 300 words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| Now, the ballot question does not change the amendment itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| It is merely designed to be a recitation, an adequate and fair representation of the full amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12152)|
| 3:22:42| But the ballot question in probably every one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12162)|
| 3:22:47| is going to be a more concise question put to the voter than the whole amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12167)|
| 3:22:54| because I suspect almost every one of these amendments is in excess of 300 words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12174)|
| 3:22:59| So would it be unfair to ask that the commission seize it before it's on the ballot, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12179)|
| 3:23:05| that it's reduced to the question that will be placed on the ballot before second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12185)|
| 3:23:13| We can do that, assuming that there's not going to be a change between the first reading and the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12193)|
| 3:23:21| But now the ballot question does not change the subject or the content, the substance of the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12201)|
| 3:23:32| I think I did put it in motion, however you want to word it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12212)|
| 3:23:35| What was your motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12215)|
| 3:23:37| I would like to see the ballot question prior to the second reading or at the time of the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12217)|
| 3:23:46| Or you're saying you want the ad hoc committee that Commissioner Briggs is saying that you're asking that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12226)|
| 3:23:51| If so, I'd like to add a friendly amendment that our chairman select five commissioners to be on this ad hoc committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12231)|
| 3:23:57| to meet with the group and with our law director to work out proper wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12237)|
| 3:24:02| and also to define the ballot question, if you would accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12242)|
| 3:24:06| I would accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12246)|
| 3:24:08| Are we looking at doing this in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12248)|
| 3:24:10| Is that everyone's flavor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12250)|
| 3:24:13| Putting it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12253)|
| 3:24:16| We're looking at November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12256)|
| 3:24:19| Now, if it's going to be in November, I can't call an ad hoc committee until after 44 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12259)|
| 3:24:28| because if I do it before the August ballot and it's before 45 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12268)|
| 3:24:33| because the ad hoc committee has to have its work done in 45 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12273)|
| 3:24:39| For me to call an ad hoc committee now would definitely be on the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12279)|
| 3:24:49| I don't think the ad hoc committee has that deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12289)|
| 3:24:52| I think it's the second reading has the deadline, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12292)|
| 3:24:56| It's the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12296)|
| 3:24:58| If there were a charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12298)|
| 3:25:01| Charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12301)|
| 3:25:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12302)|
| 3:25:03| Then you've got all these funny little deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12303)|
| 3:25:06| That would not apply to the ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12306)|
| 3:25:08| The ad hoc committee can do their work for two months, three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12308)|
| 3:25:16| Election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12316)|
| 3:25:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12319)|
| 3:25:20| If it's going to be on the August ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12320)|
| 3:25:22| the election commission has to receive it at least 45 days prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12322)|
| 3:25:28| and we always like to do it a little more because they're scrambling to get out military ballots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12328)|
| 3:25:35| and absentee and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| And presumably there would be, it's going to run in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12337)|
| 3:25:40| The charter has some requirements about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12340)|
| 3:25:43| So the whole amendment in its entirety should be published in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12343)|
| 3:25:53| And then the ballot question is supposed to be a fair representation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12353)|
| 3:25:59| So let me get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12359)|
| 3:26:02| If I call for an ad hoc committee, they don't have to be finished in 45 days, Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12362)|
| 3:26:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12370)|
| 3:26:11| No, they have to be, you know, it depends on if you want it on the August ballot or the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12371)|
| 3:26:17| Obviously, if they don't get back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| and you haven't had a chance to vote on an ordinance on second reading prior to 45 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12379)|
| 3:26:27| prior to the August election, it's not going to be on the August ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12387)|
| 3:26:32| It would be on the November ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12392)|
| 3:26:38| So it's a matter of timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12398)|
| 3:26:39| The way we looked at it, we needed to have all matters approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12399)|
| 3:26:46| I think we were looking at the very latest, June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12406)|
| 3:26:52| and we might have to move that June day up a day or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12412)|
| 3:26:59| Forty-five days, that's our deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| Forty-five days prior to the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| So count back from August 7, 45 days, and I think it puts us right on the June commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12423)|
| 3:27:11| So that really pushes us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12431)|
| 3:27:13| I think I sort of counted that back, and I believe we would almost have to vote on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12433)|
| 3:27:18| if we were doing a second reading at that Monday's combined committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12438)|
| 3:27:24| You could call a special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12444)|
| 3:27:25| Yeah, call that as a special meeting because we would be there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12445)|
| 3:27:28| If we waited until the commission meeting, I believe it goes past the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12448)|
| 3:27:32| It's too close, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12452)|
| 3:27:34| And if for some reason we can't resolve those issues by that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12454)|
| 3:27:38| we would just have to wait and do it in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12458)|
| 3:27:45| We had already talked to Mr. Talek about having an ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12465)|
| 3:27:48| and we basically talked about having four people off of the charter review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12468)|
| 3:28:10| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12490)|
| 3:28:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| Are we talking about going back to square one and considering this stuff all over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12496)|
| 3:28:23| or are we talking about just the ones that pass today have the ad hoc committee back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12503)|
| 3:28:27| The ones that fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| You see, the ones that pass will be in the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| They go to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| The ones that fail have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12513)|
| 3:28:39| The ones that failed have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| Yeah, the ones that have failed have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| I don't see how we can have a committee to bring the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12523)|
| 3:28:47| Two of these died first reading of the nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12527)|
| 3:28:50| Two of them died first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12530)|
| 3:28:53| And now 102 just died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12533)|
| 3:28:56| And I don't see any point in having an ad hoc committee for amendments that are already dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12536)|
| 3:29:03| Well, Steve, the alternative is we could take those that we haven't voted on that pass the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12543)|
| 3:29:09| but we've not voted on in the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| And if we don't like the wording on them, we could put them to the ad hoc committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12551)|
| 3:29:15| let them fix the wording, and then bring them back for the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12555)|
| 3:29:18| So we're just talking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12558)|
| 3:29:20| Or bring them back for a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12560)|
| 3:29:22| So we're just talking the one, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12562)|
| 3:29:25| We're just talking the five that are left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12565)|
| 3:29:28| That's really what you're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12568)|
| 3:29:29| The five that are left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12569)|
| 3:29:30| See what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12570)|
| 3:29:31| It's another pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| See, right now we either can vote and stop it, or we can say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12573)|
| 3:29:37| we may want to take the amendments, but they need more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12577)|
| 3:29:40| Well, we passed 101 on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12580)|
| 3:29:44| I mean, we passed one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12584)|
| 3:29:46| And I hate to have sympathy for this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12586)|
| 3:29:51| But I think they need to know tonight which one of these are dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12591)|
| 3:29:56| and which ones are going to go on the ballot so that they can attempt to get signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12596)|
| 3:30:01| Like I said, they know there's three of them that have failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12601)|
| 3:30:07| and they're going to have to go the signature route with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12607)|
| 3:30:10| if they can get the citizens to sign signatures for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12610)|
| 3:30:13| which I personally don't think they're going to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12613)|
| 3:30:16| This is such a radical change in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12616)|
| 3:30:21| But I think they need to know tonight which one of these have failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12621)|
| 3:30:24| and which ones are going on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12624)|
| 3:30:29| I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12629)|
| 3:30:30| I mean, if we vote to have an ad hoc committee, I mean, I guess I'll be okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12630)|
| 3:30:35| But I just think we've only got five left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12635)|
| 3:30:38| Let's just see which ones survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12638)|
| 3:30:41| I would agree with you is that those that we don't want to pass, we should go ahead and let them fail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12641)|
| 3:30:47| so they know what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12647)|
| 3:30:49| But there may be some that we like but we don't like the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| And, for instance, the conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12652)|
| 3:30:54| or maybe the one on county employees holding office where we had that one word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12654)|
| 3:31:00| where it said indirect compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12660)|
| 3:31:02| Now, some of us may like it, we may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12662)|
| 3:31:04| But that may be one we want to keep rather than just killing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12664)|
| 3:31:09| But if there's some that we don't want, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12669)|
| 3:31:12| We ought to just let them know what we don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12672)|
| 3:31:15| I think we need to get an understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12675)|
| 3:31:18| Mary Ann, the one that we just withdrew, that's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12678)|
| 3:31:24| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12684)|
| 3:31:25| Yeah, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| Dr. Breeds, the 102, that's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12687)|
| 3:31:30| That's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12690)|
| 3:31:31| There's no bringing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12691)|
| 3:31:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12692)|
| 3:31:33| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12695)|
| 3:31:37| You know, these things have been changing every single month that we're up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12697)|
| 3:31:43| One month the group wants to let the mayor appoint everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12703)|
| 3:31:47| Then the next month they come up here and they take out the property assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12707)|
| 3:31:51| and now they've taken it off the whole agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12711)|
| 3:31:54| It seems like every single time we want to talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12714)|
| 3:31:58| that someone's changing all the rules to every one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12718)|
| 3:32:01| I think if they're serious about passing these, they ought to get their tennis shoes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12721)|
| 3:32:06| stand at the Walmart and get their signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12726)|
| 3:32:08| I'm not going to support any of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12728)|
| 3:32:11| And, you know, it's time just to either vote them up or vote them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12731)|
| 3:32:14| We've talked about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12734)|
| 3:32:16| And I'm ready to just quit the debate and let's start voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12736)|
| 3:32:20| so these folks will know tonight what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12740)|
| 3:32:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12746)|
| 3:32:27| It's not a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12747)|
| 3:32:28| But I think we've talked about it enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12748)|
| 3:32:29| I think we all know how we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12749)|
| 3:32:31| And we need to show these folks if they're going to be on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12751)|
| 3:32:35| or if they need to go the petition way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12755)|
| 3:32:37| So I'm, you know, trying to speed us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12757)|
| 3:32:51| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12771)|
| 3:32:53| Yes, I'm in agreement with Commissioner Moore here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| These things have been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12776)|
| 3:32:58| We've taken them off the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12778)|
| 3:32:59| Now, these people are supposed to be representing the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12779)|
| 3:33:03| But they haven't had any meetings to change these wordings with these four or five hundred people they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12783)|
| 3:33:09| to change everything and to pull certain things off the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12789)|
| 3:33:12| I saw two charter things put on the ballot here, two things put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12792)|
| 3:33:19| One was term limits and the other one was the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12799)|
| 3:33:26| Now, they had a grassroots campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12806)|
| 3:33:29| They got out and got the folks, the people to sign the petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12809)|
| 3:33:34| Now, these people have raised a lot of money from a very few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12814)|
| 3:33:38| Now, they say they've got the grassroots campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12818)|
| 3:33:41| Take that money and pay for the workers if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12821)|
| 3:33:44| But I'm like Commissioner Moore, let them get out on the street corners and get the signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12824)|
| 3:33:50| and then you know the people are behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12830)|
| 3:33:52| I'm going to make a motion just that we have to get signatures on all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12832)|
| 3:33:59| It would have to be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| I'd like to make that as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12841)|
| 3:34:04| That way we know the people want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12844)|
| 3:34:06| I second to the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12846)|
| 3:34:11| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12853)|
| 3:34:14| Our rules call for ordinances to be voted on individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12854)|
| 3:34:19| If Commissioner Pinkston wants these to be defeated and make the group go to the petition route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12859)|
| 3:34:24| he simply has to vote against all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12864)|
| 3:34:28| Therefore, the motion is not in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12868)|
| 3:34:30| It's not appropriate by our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12870)|
| 3:34:32| Are you talking about all of them or just 103?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12872)|
| 3:34:34| Well, we'll take 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12874)|
| 3:34:36| I'll do the same thing, make the same motion on all the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12876)|
| 3:34:43| Are you in agreement with the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12883)|
| 3:34:44| I'm in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12884)|
| 3:34:45| Let's vote on 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12885)|
| 3:34:46| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12886)|
| 3:34:49| No, he called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12889)|
| 3:34:52| We've not read it into the record yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12892)|
| 3:34:57| Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair, I'm going to raise a point of order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12897)|
| 3:35:03| I understand the request for the substitute motion, but I don't see really that's a substitute motion to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12903)|
| 3:35:12| My question is I would like to see how any motion that we pass is going to look on the ballot before the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12912)|
| 3:35:22| And I'm not sure that the substitute motion addresses that because that's a call for up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12922)|
| 3:35:29| Yeah, and actually it's not speaking to 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12929)|
| 3:35:36| I'll second Mr. Ballard's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12936)|
| 3:35:39| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| Let's just get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12941)|
| 3:35:47| We're not on 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12947)|
| 3:35:53| Do I understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12953)|
| 3:35:54| Yeah, that's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12954)|
| 3:36:05| Commissioner Pinkston, Commissioner Ballard's motion is not on 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12965)|
| 3:36:12| We haven't gotten to it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12972)|
| 3:36:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12974)|
| 3:36:15| 103 is about conflict of interest, and that hasn't even come up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12975)|
| 3:36:19| His motion was part of the discussion when Commissioner Ballard was talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12979)|
| 3:36:25| Just the ones that pass, and I seconded that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12985)|
| 3:36:28| Well, we have a motion on the floor that doesn't have anything to do with 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12988)|
| 3:36:32| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12992)|
| 3:36:33| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12993)|
| 3:36:34| It has to do with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12994)|
| 3:36:35| What he's saying is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12995)|
| 3:36:36| No, Commissioner Ballard has a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12996)|
| 3:36:38| Yeah, and I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=12998)|
| 3:36:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13000)|
| 3:36:41| Yeah, but I'm saying it doesn't have anything to do with 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13001)|
| 3:36:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13004)|
| 3:36:45| So he cannot make a substitute motion on something totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13005)|
| 3:36:51| So, therefore, we need to vote on Commissioner Ballard's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13011)|
| 3:36:57| What was Commissioner Ballard's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13017)|
| 3:37:01| I made the motion and Mike added it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13021)|
| 3:37:03| I was going to let them read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13023)|
| 3:37:04| You can go ahead and say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13026)|
| 3:37:07| I'll let them read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13027)|
| 3:37:09| To have a ruling that will appear on the ballot prior to the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13029)|
| 3:37:14| and also for the chairman to appoint five commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13034)|
| 3:37:23| Mr. Chairman, point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13043)|
| 3:37:25| I mean, this isn't on the agenda right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13045)|
| 3:37:27| I mean, where is it on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| We have to suspend the rules to add it to the agenda to vote on it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13049)|
| 3:37:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13054)|
| 3:37:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13055)|
| 3:37:37| So it's an improper motion, so I think we need to go on to 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13057)|
| 3:37:43| If we go on to 103, then you could make the motion to that effect, Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13063)|
| 3:37:49| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13069)|
| 3:37:51| To send that on to an ad hoc committee and that they also bring back the wording of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13071)|
| 3:38:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13081)|
| 3:38:02| You just have to do it for each one, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13082)|
| 3:38:05| I don't have any discussion on anything because I'm getting ready to go to 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13085)|
| 3:38:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13089)|
| 3:38:13| And I was just going to say, bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13093)|
| 3:38:17| I don't think you've got 13 votes here for the rest of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13097)|
| 3:38:21| I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13101)|
| 3:38:23| So I guess the issue then is do you all want us to vote them up or vote them down now tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13103)|
| 3:38:29| I really think you need to know tonight because if you're going to go the petition route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| and quite frankly, change will not come from inside the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13112)|
| 3:38:37| Change is going to come from the people outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13117)|
| 3:38:39| And if you can go and get your petitions, if you can get 35,000 to 40,000 people, this is going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13119)|
| 3:38:45| And so, anyway, I just wanted to just get clarification because I really believe you need to know tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13125)|
| 3:38:50| and my sense is that we've passed one and the rest of them may or may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13130)|
| 3:38:55| But I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13135)|
| 3:38:59| Mr. Chairman, I think the question was being posed to the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13139)|
| 3:39:02| so that there will be a record of the answer from the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13142)|
| 3:39:05| We would ask that you proceed with action on each of these items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13145)|
| 3:39:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13149)|
| 3:39:16| Mr. Hammond, are you making it a point of a motion that we vote each one of them up or down with no discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13156)|
| 3:39:23| No, I don't mind discussion if you all want to discuss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13163)|
| 3:39:26| My point to them was I think they need to know tonight if they're going to do the petition drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13166)|
| 3:39:29| They said yes, so let's vote on all of them up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13169)|
| 3:39:32| That's the way I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13172)|
| 3:39:33| I don't think we should even discuss them because I'm like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13173)|
| 3:39:35| I don't think there's 13 votes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13175)|
| 3:39:40| It doesn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13180)|
| 3:39:41| It's not 13 votes anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13181)|
| 3:39:42| Yes, it takes two-thirds to pass the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13182)|
| 3:39:48| Chairman, there's already going to be a petition drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13188)|
| 3:39:51| irregardless of whether we vote the rest of them up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13191)|
| 3:39:55| They have stated in their letter, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13195)|
| 3:39:59| we have now set a petition drive start date for June 20th to deal with the proposed executive branch restructuring charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13199)|
| 3:40:07| and any of the other proposed charter amendments that you may not choose to pass on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13207)|
| 3:40:12| So they've already chosen the petition route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13212)|
| 3:40:16| Is it necessary for us to vote these up or down when they have already stated formally that they are going forward with the petition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13216)|
| 3:40:24| What's the necessity of finding out who votes what way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13224)|
| 3:40:28| Chairman, could I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13228)|
| 3:40:31| Let's make a motion that we can vote this up and down, each one of them, and get this out of our agenda forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13231)|
| 3:40:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13239)|
| 3:40:42| In fact, I guess I was going to ask the law director, how do we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13242)|
| 3:40:47| And, you know, in all this dialogue, I guess is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| It's about the second or third time that I've heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13249)|
| 3:40:52| So is there a way for us to end this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13252)|
| 3:40:55| And this is related to our lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13255)|
| 3:40:57| Is there a way for us to end this dialogue and get started on voting on these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13257)|
| 3:41:02| Mr. Law Director, could we make a motion to withdraw the rest of these items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13262)|
| 3:41:09| I'm going to ask a question of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13269)|
| 3:41:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13271)|
| 3:41:14| I think you could do it as a motion to withdraw, but I think you need to do it one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13274)|
| 3:41:19| It would still be one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13279)|
| 3:41:20| Read them into the record one by one and vote on each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13280)|
| 3:41:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| Could you read them into the record all together and take one vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13286)|
| 3:41:29| One by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| One by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13290)|
| 3:41:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13291)|
| 3:41:32| One vote for each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13292)|
| 3:41:33| Commissioner Lambert, so we can go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13293)|
| 3:41:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13294)|
| 3:41:35| I wanted to address Ms. Davis' question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13295)|
| 3:41:37| Elaine, honestly, I've been through a petition drive before, and the standard is much higher now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13297)|
| 3:41:44| There's some of this stuff that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13304)|
| 3:41:46| 101 that we just passed, if we can fix that to where we can lower the standard, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13306)|
| 3:41:55| And while I don't necessarily approve of how this group was formed and the way they've conducted themselves, that one is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13315)|
| 3:42:03| There's some others on here that could be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13323)|
| 3:42:06| I don't think they're going to be that successful with their petition drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13326)|
| 3:42:10| but we still have an opportunity to pass some of these in an amended form and do something good for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13330)|
| 3:42:17| And, you know, frankly, I don't care where these came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13337)|
| 3:42:20| Some of them are good, and I'm, you know, and I think 101 is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13340)|
| 3:42:25| Well, we've already passed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13345)|

| 3:44:22| Mr. Chairman, I've got a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13462)|
| 3:44:33| Would you consider the changes they made substantial enough that this is a first reading or a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13473)|
| 3:44:37| reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13477)|
| 3:44:39| I don't think these are substantial enough to turn this into a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13479)|
| 3:44:47| I tend to disagree because of how they have termed personal interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13487)|
| 3:44:52| They've redefined what a personal interest is versus a financial interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13492)|
| 3:44:59| And I think that that is a substantial change in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13499)|
| 3:45:05| Based on the law director's recommendation, I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13505)|
| 3:45:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13509)|
| 3:45:10| Reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13510)|
| 3:45:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13511)|
| 3:45:12| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13512)|
| 3:45:16| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13516)|
| 3:45:20| This is the one about saying you can't vote if you have a conflict of interest, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13520)|
| 3:45:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13528)|
| 3:45:29| 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13529)|
| 3:45:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13530)|
| 3:45:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13532)|
| 3:45:33| We're having the vote for it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13533)|
| 3:45:34| We had the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13534)|
| 3:45:35| It's actually the one that deals with administrative matters, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13535)|
| 3:45:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13538)|
| 3:45:39| What exactly are you trying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| Decisions on grants, for example, by the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13541)|
| 3:45:44| That would be an administrative matter, the sort of things that you've been concerned about this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13544)|
| 3:45:48| Well, here's one of my issues, and I want to ask you if this would affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13548)|
| 3:45:55| If a commissioner has a conflict of interest, the commissioner is not representing themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13555)|
| 3:46:01| They're representing a district, and everybody in the district doesn't necessarily have a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part2?start=13561)|
