| 0:05:16| Also, folks had a chance to look at the plans for the new downtown dog park at a meeting last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| and thank folks for their participation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=324)|

| 0:05:36| That's presented by or prepared by MPC under ordinance requirement, and that was from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=336)|

| 0:08:44| A number of us were able to attend that today, and as always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| it was a very special remembrance of some folks that worked very hard for the safety of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| I believe it was last Wednesday that the Big Read was launched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| It's a great event that the local library supports or initiates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| and this year we're going to be reading The Grapes of Wrath by the Nobel Laureate John Steinbeck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| And I believe if you go online to the city website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| you can find a link to the Big Read and locate a study circle or a study group or a reading group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=555)|
| 0:09:24| It's a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| This is not on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| This is actually a book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| You have to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Please partake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| I did want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Do you have the Cliff Notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| I'll explain it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| You were referring to the North Knoxville and then also the bike ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| North Knoxville has taken off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| New bakery, new restaurant, a yoga center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| I mean, a lot of things that we had been hoping to see happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| And I'm excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| I mean, each one of those things in and of themselves may not seem like a big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| but collectively we're rebuilding the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| So it's very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| And I appreciate your work on behalf of that part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| That truly is one where lots of people have done things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| a lot of the neighborhood folks and businesses there and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| But there is a lot of reason for encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Councilman Hulkus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| I just want to make an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| On Thursday, October 16th from 6 to 730,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| this is in conjunction with the South Waterfront redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| There will be an open house with the U.S. Corps of Engineers and TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| It has to do with permit applications and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| It sounds a little dry, but it is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| and some people will be very interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| It's at South Knoxville Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| and normally it's something that they wouldn't have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| but Dave Hill and others involved really pushed them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| And so that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Anybody that's interested in how shoreline permitting is going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| and what's going to be allowed and what won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| I encourage you to show up again on the 16th at 6 o'clock at South Knoxville Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| Thanks, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Councilman Haslam, Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| this evening I want to take the opportunity to bring to everyone's attention a very special individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| who has worked very hard, speaking of neighborhoods, and a lifetime of volunteering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| And this is a gentleman who represents a neighborhood in the district I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| and the neighborhood as well as, I think, the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| can be very grateful for his willingness to spend most of his retirement years to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| on behalf of the city and on behalf of the neighborhoods of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| Tonight we have a resolution that we added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| And it is to honor Joe Fuhrer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| Dr. Fuhrer has been a longtime president of the West Hills Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| That's the good news and the bad news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Everybody wants to replace Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| But he has been wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| He and his wife, Erica, have given untold hours to working with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| And it's a large neighborhood, so the neighborhood has kept him quite busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| And tonight it's my pleasure to present this resolution in honor of Joe and his volunteer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=746)|
| 0:12:34| Joe isn't exactly going to disappear from the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Joe and Erica have decided to devote their future time to the Ladies of Charity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| which is a great organization that benefits our entire, especially the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| And we are grateful for their decision to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| So at this time I would like to spin the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| and ask if we might be able to consider resolution number 11-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Motion. Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Okay. All those in favor of considering 11-R, now aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Okay. Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| 11-R itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| I suppose somebody has to say this and our resident comic doesn't seem to pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| The only reason I let it go on by motion was you told me he was going to disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| Actually, I think we may be able to talk him into that after tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| I actually would like to be added as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| I think all of council would appreciate that if you would note that, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| And shall we vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| Yes, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| And then we have a special presentation for you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| So if you'll come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| I want to add my thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| Joe has served on everything from traffic comment committees to golf committees to zoning boards, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| He's done everything except pick up a Tennessee accent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| So for that, Joe, we're very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| So true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Joe can work on that now in his retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=843)|
| 0:14:17| The mayor's coming, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| I expected him to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=860)|

| 0:15:43| slide by under reports of council members and beg the indulgence. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| something coming up real soon. I'm sure Councilman Bailey's too modest to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| mention it, but there's the golf tournament and baseball clinics being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| done in honor of his father. The golf tournament's coming up. There's a concert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=955)|

| 0:16:10| mention it out of modesty. Thank you, Councilman Frost. We do, we've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| couple of charities we're raising money for. I think through one of which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| through the Boys and Girls Club, which is going to be for inner-city boys and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| girls to kind of enhance and utilize some of the city assets. And we also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| another charity, the Kids Team, which is a great charity. This coming Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=992)|

| 0:17:20| item or? I did have something on, no, not on the item we're getting ready to vote on, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| kind of, this kind of, okay, just need to kind of catch up on something we didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| we failed to do. I believe that it would be in order for Council to congratulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| our newest dad. I believe Councilman Bailey and his wife are the parents of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| second little girl. And you might want to tell us a bit about that. But we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| congratulate you and to wish all of you well. Thank you. Yep. Little Sloan was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| born Friday, 7-15. She was seven pounds, two ounces, 20 inches long, and just were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1075)|
| 0:18:04| real blessed. Congratulations. That's great. Joe, Joe came on Council as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1084)|
| 0:18:15| bachelor and five years later, he's married with two kids. So if your social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| life is dull, congratulations, Joe. Actually, we still need to work on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| First District. Okay. Joe, is this, okay, thank you. Go ahead. Yeah, I had my light on again and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1105)|
| 0:18:35| things started moving, so I turned it back off. But now that we're back into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| announcements again, I'm going to go for it. I just realized there's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| thing that I overlooked the first announcement. On Monday, October 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| from 6 to 8 p.m., the Vestal Commercial Area plan public meeting will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| The first public meeting on the plan that's being developed for the Vestal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Commercial Area through the Empowerment Zone redevelopment process. Elizabeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Easton Architecture is the lead firm on that. And that's at Vestal United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| Methodist Church. Again, it's Monday the 20th of this month at 6 p.m. Thanks, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| Okay, now we're back to the item before us, which is an appeal, which is 10a. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1150)|
| 0:19:19| we do have some folks signed up to speak for that, and I take it Council would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| like to hear from them. We have three people signed up to speak in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Kenny Cloninger, Connie Cavanaugh, and Paul Dickinson. If each of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| you would just give us your name and address, please. Mayor Haslam, members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Council, my name is Kenny Cloninger. I live at 2821 Gibbs Drive in Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| City. My wife and I have lived there for 32 years. It's the fourth house on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1182)|
| 0:19:48| left off Broadway. We've raised two sons there. Our home has been in my wife's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| family since it was completed in 1913 by her great-grandfather. There are six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| other houses on the street that are still owned by the descendants of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| the original families. My neighbors are very proud of our street, and I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| recognize them. We all share in the pride of knowing we live on a street that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1208)|
| 0:20:20| resembles hometown America, a street known as Gibbs-Money addition to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| Fountain City when it was registered in 1910. It is said that change comes with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| time. We want to remain as we are, but also be a lasting and vibrant community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| We know enduring neighborhoods help make great cities like Knoxville. I handed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1238)|
| 0:20:46| you all a handout, which is two pages. One is from Stanton to Jacksboro, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| the other is from Stanton to Broadway. The numbers on there show you the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| number on the left, and on the right, the first year that the house was occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| from records out of the old city directories. I've brought a board up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1261)|
| 0:21:10| this is our neighborhood in pictures if you want to see it. These 52 homes you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| see here offer a wide range of architecture, many that qualify for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| National Register. It is truly a magnificent place to live and raise a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| family with tree-lined sidewalks that make it a very picturesque street. Our street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| connects to the major thoroughfares of Broadway on one end, Jacksboro Pike on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| the other end. For almost a hundred years, our neighborhood has remained whole with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| no homes lost due to fire or neglect. The Kroger Company has chosen to build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| new and larger store across Broadway from our street. We as a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| welcome them, wish to thank them for choosing the property where the vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| Target building now stands. We are sure they will be a great complement to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| community, as they have been in the previous two moves from Tazewell Pike to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| Highland Drive and now to this location. Kroger has worked with Fountain City Connections in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| placement of sidewalks, steps to Knox Road, as well as the addition of a bus stop on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| Knox Road side of the property. All these requests added to this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| plan shows an apparent willingness by Kroger to work with the community to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| make the area around their new store more pedestrian friendly. However, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| residents of Gibbs Drive feel this alignment to our street will forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| change our lifestyles, property values, and the safety and integrity of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| street and our neighborhood. The serene park-like atmosphere of Gibbs Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| serves as a refuge not only for the 52 families who live here on the street, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| for many of our surrounding neighbors who walk, run, bird watch, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| bike on our street. The alignment of the Kroger entrance with our street is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| serious threat to this serenity. Please support us in preserving this unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| character of our street. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| Hi, Mayor Haslam, members of Council. I'm Connie Cavanaugh. I reside at 3002 Gibbs Drive, and I'm here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1399)|
| 0:23:30| tonight to respectfully encourage you to consider the proposed entrance to Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| that aligns it with Gibbs Drive. My neighbors and I believe that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| alignment is detrimental to our neighborhood and to public safety. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| love our street. Gibbs Drive is well known throughout Knoxville as a quiet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| friendly street, and we have sidewalks on both sides of the street, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| realize how fortunate we are for that. A street with beautiful 20th century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| bungalows lined with old pink dogwoods that date from the early 1920s. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| one of Knoxville's 22 registered historic districts. Gibbs Drive is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| the starting point for the Fountain City Dogwood Trail. We welcome pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| throughout the year as we see people from surrounding neighborhoods come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| daily to exercise, walk their dogs, and stroll their babies on our beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| shaded street. We also have a diverse group of 52 resident families. Families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| who have lived there for three generations in the same home. Families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| with children ranging in age from toddler to teenager who want to watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| their children play in their yards and feel safe. Couples who want a diverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| neighborhood where they can walk safely and visit from the sidewalks up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| front porches of our homes. Singles who want a friendly neighborhood atmosphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| and safety and a quiet haven to come home to. Our neighborhood supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| sidewalks and appreciates the hard work and efforts that Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| Connections made to ensure that sidewalks are in place at the new Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| site. Our concerns are increased traffic, speeding, and increased litter. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| mission statement of the Knoxville Neighborhood Traffic Safety Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| says, and I quote, the desirability of Knoxville neighborhoods as places to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| live and raise a family is directly affected by local traffic conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| end quote. We are certain that aligning the entrance with Gibbs Drive will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| encourage cut-through traffic. For instance, drivers who wish to avoid the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| Esri Road-Broadway intersection will use Gibbs Drive as a new cut-through to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| get to the new Kroger store. The increased traffic will be a hazard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| pedestrians and will create an undesirable environment for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| residents. Also, we are particularly concerned that students on foot and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| skateboards will view this aligned entrance as quick shot across five lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| of Broadway and through the Kroger parking lot to the new skate park that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| we have. There are currently two intersections with traffic lights that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| offer access across Broadway in a controlled and safe manner. Obviously, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| do not want to encourage pedestrians to cross five lanes of traffic at an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| uncontrolled intersection. Kroger's proposed alignment creates a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| false sense of security, but keeping the entrance where it currently is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| discourages people from crossing Broadway. We do not want people to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| that false sense of security. Speeding will likely occur with the increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| traffic. Many people choose to shop at Kroger on their way home at the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| the day and are no doubt in a hurry to get home. We believe that this increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| in shopper traffic will coincide with our most popular time for pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| which is late afternoon and early evening. Also, that is when the children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| are home from school and the safety at that intersection is compromised with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| speeding vehicles. Our neighborhood students from Central High School walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| across Gibbs at that intersection. If our street becomes a cut-through, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| safety is at risk. The current offset entrance was successful for another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| major retailer for 25 plus years. The connectivity to the new Kroger store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| will not be impeded by the existing entrance. Drivers will still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| convenient access into the parking lot. There is an existing turn lane on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| Broadway that assists safe entry. Currently, we have neighborhood friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| access into our neighborhood with easy entry and exit. We want our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| to remain strong and safe. We're excited that Kroger is expanding its presence in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| Fountain City and I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| process with Kroger and with you. And I hope that in that spirit of cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| that you will consider leaving the entrance where it is and not aligning it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| with Gibbs Drive. Thank you. Thank you. Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1672)|
| 0:28:01| Hi, I am Paul Dickinson. I live at 3013 Gibbs Drive and I'm the co-chair of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| Historic Gibbs Drive Neighborhood Association. My wife and two-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| daughter and I moved to Gibbs Drive almost 20 years ago in search of peace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| and quiet, sidewalks and children, and a close-knit neighborhood community. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| found exactly what we were looking for, but some things have changed. My daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| is now a senior in college and my son a junior at Central High School. She's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| constantly asking for money and he's constantly asking for my car keys. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| some things haven't changed. Gibbs Drive continues to be a close-knit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| neighborhood community with sidewalks, children, peace and quiet. While the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| children of yesterday have mostly grown up and moved away, new families continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| to move in, looking for the same community and family values that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| attracted people to Gibbs Drive for nearly 100 years. In fact, in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| depressed economy and housing market, two new families have moved in in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| month to Gibbs Drive for these very reasons. At least one of them is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| tonight. Somewhere. Gibbs Drive has been around nearly 100 years. Kroger, on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| other hand, moves on average of once every 20 years. Yet Kroger is asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| Gibbs Drive to accept a change we believe could adversely affect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| safety of our residents, the value of our homes, and the quality of our lives. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| quality is what we, the residents of Gibbs Drive, have invested our life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| savings into and have trusted as being the way we want to raise our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| Nearly 20 years ago, the residents of Gibbs Drive came before City Council to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| argue against a proposed commercial development at the corner of Gibbs Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| and Broadway that would have encroached upon the peace, quiet, and neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| nature of our street. Now, we come before City Council again in an attempt to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| work with a new commercial development. We want Kroger to remain in Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| City and be successful in Fountain City. We applaud their commitment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| sidewalks, we approve of their landscaping and beautification efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| and we appreciate their presence and trust in Fountain City. But we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| want the increased traffic and alignment of Kroger's parking lot and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| Gibbs Drive would encourage. We don't want the noise, we don't want the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| litter, the safety concerns, or the disruption of our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| lifestyle, more traffic would cause. And we have the full support of Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| City Town Hall. 20 years ago, Gibbs Drive asked City Council for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| help. City Council supported us. Now, we need Council again and we hope and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| pray that you'll support us once more. Please uphold our appeal. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you. I don't have anyone signed up to speak against this. I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| anyone's here representing Kroger. If you don't have to, but if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| like to speak, you're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1853)|
| 0:31:00| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| Thank you. My name is Paul Gianca. I'm a real estate manager with Kroger. I live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| in Marietta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| And thank you for taking away half of my speech, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| again, we're here today to discuss our proposed relocation from a 48,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| square foot store to an 80,000 square foot store. Um, our plan here is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| raise the target building and construct a new building on the site. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| really isn't the heart of the matter is that the depth of our building is 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| feet less than what the depth of the target building was. And that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| precipitated our request and need to move the access drive 30 feet closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| which unfortunately and accidentally lines up with Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| Chris Kirby is passing out some items and he'll go into that in more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| in a moment. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| but, you know, again, they've taken away part two of my whole, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| speech. We've worked with everybody going through the process. And as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| were going through the process, um, the folks that Gibbs Drive contacted us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| and asked us to meet with them. I met with them, understood their concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| sat down with Mr Kirby, revisited the traffic analysis. We made some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| assumptions, closing drives and and doing alternative movements. And what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| the problem is, is there's a ripple effect. Every time you make one change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| it does things to other intersections. And Mr Kirby will take you through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| Um, we met again with the residents of Gibbs Drive. They proposed another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| alternative. We reviewed that with our engineering team, and unfortunately it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| still doesn't do what we wanted to do. And our our core issue here is we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| to preserve and have fluid internal circulation. We are deeply concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| about the public safety. If the alignments are not, if the roads are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| not aligned, there is some serious conflicting movements that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| concerns with. And Mr Kirby will take you through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Mhm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Um, unfortunately, in order to move forward with this project, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| requesting and here before you, um, requesting that we align these drives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| And unfortunately, in our meetings with the town residents, we were not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| to come up with a viable solution that makes everybody happy. Um, if I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| for one moment, um, uh, before we get to the meat of the matter, I will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| through the objections or the appeal on the lighting trees in the loading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2003)|
| 0:33:29| dock area. One of the appeal was our lighting. We use directional lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| in the store. Um, it is extremely efficient. You have no bleed over and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| spill over. So I'm not concerned about the bleeding situation or the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| that other concern was noise. We do not use dumpsters. We use, um, compactors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2022)|
| 0:33:50| that are picked up once or twice a week. And if there is a problem with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| pickup times, we can modify that to make sure we don't have any issues. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| think with the proximity, uh, the distance and the noise from Broadway, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| don't think it'll be an issue. But again, we can tweak the hours if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| becomes an issue. Um, the other one was landscaping and the loading dock. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| way the site sits, as you know, when you're going up Broadway, you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| up the grade on the loading dock sits back. We do have it heavily treed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| the eastern boundary, and we're more than willing to add additional trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| If what we have planned is not enough with that to the meat of the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| I'll have you speak with Mr Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| Good evening, Honorable Mayor and Council. My name is Chris Kirby. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| with Wilbur Smith Associates, 1100 Marion Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| Um, we were hired by Kroger to perform the traffic impact study for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| project. And as we typically do, we started with the site plan, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| reviewed internal circulations and and the overall scope of the project. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| became quickly apparent that the building, the new building, the Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| building will be much not nearly as deep as existing target building. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| that creates the drive aisle effectively to shift to the north. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2106)|
| 0:35:12| as is good practice, the drive aisle, which is in front of the store, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| usually connected with the driveway that ties into the street, which, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| this case, will be Broadway. Because of that shift, it brought it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| alignment with the Gibbs drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| And, you know, typically, as we went along into the study, we said, Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| let's let's evaluate what this alignment will mean from a traffic engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| standpoint. So if you can look at the first handout that that I gave to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| there, you can see the existing alignment, which effectively the Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| drive in the existing driver separated now by, you know, about 2 to 3 car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| links. Uh, and you can see in red there where you have something called a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| interlocking left turn conflict. What that means is, is if you have traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| exiting, you know, the Kroger making the left and also a vehicle exiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| Gibbs drive making a left, you have an additional conflict point, which then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| creates a head on collision hazard, effectively with an offset formation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| If you'll go to the next page, you can see a crew drawing that I did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| shows what happens with an alignment of the driveway with Gibbs drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| Effectively, you eliminate that conflicting movement, that conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| point, the interlocking left turns. Thus, this actually makes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| intersection safer to make it into alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Uh, another quick note that if, if you were to keep the driveways offset as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| they are, effectively that would put the driveway directly into the Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| parking. And what that means is, is people are turning off of Broadway into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| the center, as we all have done in the past. You're, you're fighting against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| people that are backing out of parking spaces. You're fighting against people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| that are walking to and from the store. Uh, you have internal conflict there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| Um, and it's, it's not, not a good design. It's, in fact, it's, it's a, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| dangerous design. Uh, effectively, uh, this could carry over as people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| trying to make their movements into the center. It could cause queuing up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| backups on Broadway, which then could even cause rear end accidents. So from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| traffic safety standpoint, it was our opinion and, uh, and not only our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| opinion, but we, we typically work with the MPC and city engineering staff, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| to, you know, come up with conclusions and all that. And, and effectively the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| MPC, the coach department and the engineering staff were in agreement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| in this case, the alignment of the driveway is, is a positive move and will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| increase safety. Well, now here's the crux of the issue. If you go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| next page, uh, I've provided you a, basically a KGS printout of the overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| area. Uh, we're, we're not only interested in just the traffic safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| aspect of it. We're actually interested in looking at the cut through potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| Uh, and you can see the site is kind of, uh, written out in, in blue there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| Gibbs drive is, is in blue and you have several adjacent intersections here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| where you have Esri and Broadway highlighted in yellow and a signal shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| there. And also you have the intersection of Renwick and Knox drive also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| highlighted in yellow. Um, part of the decision making process was to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| drive through the neighborhood and look at, uh, the overall area and, and come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| up with, well, what is the most attractive to drivers? Well, in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| case, you can see that you've got good connectivity between Renwick, uh, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| also Knox road and Esri road to Broadway here and their signalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| intersections as well, which, you know, even the community here acknowledges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| that there are safer ways for people to go. Now, on the other hand, if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| at the site and the Gibbs drive alignment, uh, for someone to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| cross, uh, effectively Gibbs drive to make it to Kroger would be traversing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| six lanes of traffic, uh, on Broadway, which carries approximately 42,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| vehicles a day. It's a very, very difficult maneuver to make. And, uh, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| we just felt like, you know, doing our field studies that this, this movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| it was, was exceedingly difficult to make. It would be not nearly as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| attractive as using the adjacent intersections with a traffic signal. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| you'll go to the next page in your handout, also as a part of our study, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| do traffic counts of the onsite intersections and we wanted to look and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| see, well, what, what are the numbers telling us, uh, Gibbs drive now? And if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| you can follow, if you go down to the bubble, which is right beside Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| driving label, you'll see that you have very extremely low volumes on Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| drive now, uh, coming to and coming from Gibbs drive. In effect, this count was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| done in a.m. and p.m. peak hours. So this is the heaviest period of traffic in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| the day. You can see that currently, you know, there is not a trend for cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| through traffic from Jacksboro or the subdivisions or the community over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| to Broadway or to any of the establishments. So we felt pretty good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| about that. And once again, we work with MPC or with engineering staff to see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| they can confirm and feel the same as we work through the report together. Sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| you'll have about one more minute. Basically, if you'll go through and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| look into the next piece of the handout, we get into major traffic generators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| Effectively, Kroger's needs 360 spaces. Sonic could generate the need for 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2451)|
| 0:40:59| spaces. That puts you at 380. The significance of a major traffic generator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| is that it would allow flexibility in moving the design of the driveways, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| would take you out of the restrictions of what you would have in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| normal conditions. And you can see that whenever Kroger also adds in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| taking some of the burden for the skate park and the transit station for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| community, they approach that 400 space threshold, which would put it into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| major traffic generator. Which, you know, actually if you turn to the next couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| of pages, you can see that it allows you that flexibility to move and come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| with a good design from a traffic engineering standpoint. The rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| pages are pretty much not my words. They're from other parts of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| dealing with offset intersections, the dangers, the hazards of it. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| something from Cal Berkeley. They're something from Connecticut. Basically, just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| web search of offset intersections. They're hazards. So don't take my word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| entirely for it. Just, you know, realize that we have several folks. The city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| you know, staff is in agreement. And also, you know, we have the backing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| from other parts of the country. Thank you very much. Those who spoke in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| favor, you have two minutes for rebuttal if you would like it. One speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| Mayor. Yes, excuse me. Councilman Hall. Sir, I think Councilman Hall might have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| question before you sit down. Yes. Are you talking about moving the new Kroger's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| building up toward Gibbs Drive? Yep. I think, and Paul may speak better to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| than I, because I'm simply the traffic engineer, but. Well, I've got a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| questions reason I asked. Yeah, the Kroger building is less deep, so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| comes up. But you're gonna bring the building up. Yes. The building will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| back. The building goes back. It's not as wide as the target. So that causes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| drive-all to be shifted to the north. How far back? About 30 feet. About how many feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2571)|
| 0:43:01| 35 feet or so. I can show it to you here if you wish. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2581)|
| 0:43:14| Councilman, same question, same address, same person you want to talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| Yes. Okay. Okay, sir, you might return to the podium. I think there's another question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2599)|
| 0:43:29| you. I think he needs you back at the podium. Oh, you want to see that? I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| sorry. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| Okay, you might return to the podium, please. I think there's an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2619)|
| 0:43:50| question. Councilman Becker? Thank you. Mr. Gianca, we had a conversation this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2630)|
| 0:43:59| afternoon, and you said something there that I don't know if I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| clearly in your statement. I want to ask, what's the position of Kroger's if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| the drive alignment does not happen? Due to the public safety issue and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| concerns, I've been directed that if we can't align the drives, we're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| to move forward with the project. Okay, Councilman Whitel. I had a question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2656)|
| 0:44:24| the traffic engineer, Wilbur Smith. This particular study, these numbers are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| the site is not active. So if you have an active site drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| people to that site, it seems like you would get very different numbers. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| then, in your professional opinion, wouldn't the numbers change? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| mean, there is no draw. There's nothing here at this site. So you put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| Kroger or a box there, and all of a sudden people are behaving differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| And so it's very likely that there will be cut through traffic in Gibbs. Well, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| diagram that I provided to you is just to show current trends. Right. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| also, when you get into the projection part of it, which is what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| talking about, that's where we have to rely on discussion and field review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| with other parties like City Engineering, MPC, and that's what we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| to come up with the numbers that we did. But it is true, there's a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| different dynamic going on between this here, this study, where there's nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| there. That is just a display. That's not the full study. That's simply an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| exhibit of existing traffic that was taken from the study itself. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| Thanks. Any other questions? Okay. Councilman Frost. I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| I met with Mr. Kirby, who actually is a former Fountain City, but to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| what Councilman Woodhull was saying, I've got the entire traffic study, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| actually the site was vacant when that traffic study was done, when those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| counts were done. So you're right. Thanks. Councilman Hookless. Mr. King, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| have a question for you. You familiar with the Food City store on Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| Highway? It used to be a Bi-Lo, and then they closed, and then Food City moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| into it. It's between Woodlawn and Fronda. Yes. There's, between Woodlawn and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2773)|
| 0:46:20| Fronda, you know, it's a setback strip center. Food City's sort of on the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| end, so to speak, and more or less centered in that the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| accessing the parking lot from Chapman Highway is an entrance, an entrance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| exit for the parking lot, and those two, they function like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| slip lanes, essentially. There's a name for that, I assume. Right in, right out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| Right in, right out. Okay. Well, that's a good simple engineering description. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| simple people. Yeah. You know, in looking at this and looking at, I'll just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2813)|
| 0:47:01| Paul, I always struggle with your last names. The diagram or the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2821)|
| 0:47:09| I should say, that he has, it looks like it would be possible to rework, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2829)|
| 0:47:19| you essentially got that front laner aisle in front of the store, and where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| opens onto Knox Road, you have Fair Drive, and I have to move this a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| bit to be able to read it, but Maple Drive coming in, sort of all converging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2850)|
| 0:47:38| right there on Knox, right more or less where that, the drive aisle in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| front of the store would be. There's no drive aisle at the bottom of that screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| there. It appears when you look at it, but when you look at in detail, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| see that where there's a grassy area, there's actually no. That's not where I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| going with this. What I'm, where I'm going with this is, if you were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| create an entrance exit for that drive aisle and put in a light there, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2880)|
| 0:48:08| have intersections like that. They're not perfect, but one example would be Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| Avenue, and Broadway, and what's the street that goes over the viaduct? Anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2894)|
| 0:48:22| you've got lights that control movements on all those streets, essentially one, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| set of lights, one set, one control, so that you could control people coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| and out and not have a dangerous intersection or conflicts, you know, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| far as making it a controlled intersection there, and if you put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| right in and right out at the end of the drive aisle, it wouldn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| matter if it was opposing Gibbs Drive or not, because functionally, it wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| allow people to cross back and forth from Gibbs Drive, but they'd still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| able to get in southbound on Broadway, right into the center, going out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| center, and then going southbound on Broadway, and if they need to get back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| Broadway going northbound, they can get on Knox Road going in either direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| either going over to the intersection south of the center, where the little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| whatever the fast-food place is now, where there's still rallies or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| it is, or north up Cedar, Knox Road to Cedar Lane. It seems to me like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| would be a functional solution. Mr. King, do you have any thoughts about that, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| to whether or not that might work? I'm not saying, in your professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| opinion, can you certify that it would work tonight? I'm just asking you if such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| a solution might be worth considering. Well, I think it would be possible, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2978)|
| 0:49:46| I don't know whether Kroger has asked Wilbur Smith to analyze that, but one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| thing that would enter into my mind would be the left turn capacity of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| signal with their projected traffic. Could that signal handle that left turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| movement on to Knox, which is how, one, if you're outbound or northbound traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=2999)|
| 0:50:07| on Broadway, you would have to turn left at Knox to get in into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| proposed Kroger site, rather than turning into the driveway as their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| site plan shows, which is near Gibbs Drive. I understand, and I suspect that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| volumes are a little higher for Kroger than they would have been for the target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| projected numbers, but I don't know how substantially different they would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| but obviously it did function before, so the question is with improvements like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| this, because essentially you'd be taking the same set of circumstances and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| some improvements, making that one restriction where you don't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| left-bound turn off of Broadway directly into the center, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| essentially, that's the main thing that you're losing, is what I'm hearing, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| terms of access into the center. In other words, you'd have to turn on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Knox to be able to get into the center, but would you think that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3058)|
| 0:51:04| worth at least further analysis and consideration as an option? It would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| an option. Thank you. Thanks. Okay, if I may speak, we actually did look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3070)|
| 0:51:18| moving the trips from that intersection at Gibbs Drive via, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| right-in, right-outs and other access control measures, and one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| concerns with doing that is stressing out that Knox intersects with Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| as we were talking, but in essence, one thing to consider also is that as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| coordinated system, so what you do to Knox, you do to all of Broadway, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| the reason why it is quite so sensitive there. But did you actually do a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| study on it? We provided the left-turn movements to Knox for as if you were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| eliminate the left-turn movements out of the site. If you do that, you have a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| drop in level of service at the Knox and Broadway intersection. Okay. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3121)|
| 0:52:10| understand that. What's that mean? It's a grading scale, in effect, for delay. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3130)|
| 0:52:18| as A being the highest level and F being the lowest, effectively, it drops it from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| I believe, the worst or critical time from a D to an E. So it is drops it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| nearly to very near an F. So it's one knot, one letter down, one grade down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| essentially. Right. Which is certainly what we've seen recommended in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| situations even two weeks ago. We did ask, based on our conversation with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| residents, we did look at a right-in right-out, and again the level of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| when you when you eliminate the left-out and the left-in drops the level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| service on the other two intersections down a grade from where they are today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| and they're already at. In effect, the real crux of the issue is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3178)|
| 0:53:07| coordination of the corridor. When you're talking about just simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| intersections, it's not as big a deal, but this, in effect, this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| corridor is affected by that one particular intersection. Okay. Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| questions for those folks? Okay. Those in favor have a two-minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| rebuttal time. Thank you. My name is George Scott. I live at 3045 Gibbs Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3208)|
| 0:53:35| and I tell you, I'm really happy to be an American today where a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| full of concerned citizens can stand up to a multi-million dollar project and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| actually try to form it to protect ourselves. And I thank you all for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| hearing us. They talked about a ripple effect. For this, for our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| this would be a tsunami. This would be a drastic change in our neighborhood. We,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| they say that by moving the building forward, it accidentally aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3236)|
| 0:54:01| the street with our street, their exit. Well, we suggested three alternatives for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| them to work with with their engineers. We didn't hire an engineer, but we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| see the difference this would make, including moving the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| forward again or redesigning their parking lot. They've put a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| into this already and we really hope they make a success out of it. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| very thankful that they have made this pedestrian friendly. They've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| sensitive to us on landscaping and sound and lighting. We love Kroger. As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| the danger to the streets go, I've looked at all of the accident reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| since over the last five years and I've only found one incident that's even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3274)|
| 0:54:40| related to the driveway at Target. And it had nothing to do, apparently had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| nothing to do with Gibbs Drive at all. And in five years, one accident, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| includes while Target was there for part of it, is not to me enough of a reason to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| really put our neighborhood in danger. Finally, I just want to mention that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| your own zoning regulations, the City of Knoxville, under development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| for uses permitted on review, there's one item in here, there's several items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| apply. One of them says, this use is not, the use should not be of a nature or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| located as to draw substantial additional traffic through residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| streets. And council people, that's what we are and we really do appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| listening to us as well as taking the business interests in consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you. Thank you very much. Councilman Becker. Excuse me, sir. A couple, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| this is, you know, if some other folks want to answer this, that works. Three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| well, one comment and then two questions. I actually think your comment about being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| in America where this can happen, I think a flip side of it is just how well I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| think the neighborhood, and I'll say Kroger as well, have communicated. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| been some good discussion. I've never been to a neighborhood meeting without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| an engineer present where the neighborhood actually presents a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| with a map on it. That was a, you know, some impressive work you all have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| I have two questions for you all just to get things clear. We talked at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| point at a meeting about lining up the two drives and putting a right in, right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| out in the Kroger driveway. Is that something that the neighborhood would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| consider? We have discussed this amongst us and I can only speak for myself. Each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| individual can each speak and each would say something maybe similar, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| think. From our perspective, we're willing to compromise on just about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| anything except lining our quiet residential street up with the major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| entrance to a major store. It would really make a big difference. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| that's my recollection of the discussion. The other one I ask is, is Mr. Gianca| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| said that if the driveways don't line up, Kroger won't build the store. And I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| to know what your, what your reaction to that is. Does that make you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| differently about what you're, what you're thinking? What's your, what's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| response? Again, we don't have a stated policy as a neighborhood. Personally, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| used to love to walk down to Kroger and wait for traffic and cross the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| when I could. But I look forward to seeing some kind of residential, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| some kind of commercial operation there and a Kroger would be the ideal, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| For me. Let me ask this, and again it's broader for the neighborhood in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| general, does, does Kroger saying they're not going to build make you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| think it's worth having any more discussions with Kroger about this? We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| happy to discuss with Kroger at any time, as at their convenience. We are, we're, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| feel, I feel there's a consensus, I am NOT one of the presidents, that there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| be a commercial business there at some point. And we hope it's Kroger. Okay, other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3457)|
| 0:57:45| question? Now I guess we're just, we'll move to open question, discussion for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| council members. Thank you very much. Councilman Becker again. If there are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| delights, I don't know if you've got your... Okay. Councilman Frost. Thank you. The way I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3473)|
| 0:58:01| basically see this, there are, you know, well first I'd like to thank Paul Gianca| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| for being so available and so willing to share information and also Chris Kirby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| for willing to take the time for about half an hour to sit down with me and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| over the traffic study. I'd be remiss to not say that. There are, I see two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| constants in this situation. One constant is Kroger moves every 10 to 15 years. As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| you heard one of the speakers talk tonight, this is, this will be the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| location in Fountain City for Kroger's. They started at the far southern end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| Fountain City, which is now where CC's Pizza, Party City, and Blockbuster is. Then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| they moved up to the intersection of Broadway and Highland and they're moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3524)|
| 0:58:51| again. Whatever goes, whatever goes in this facility will be successful. Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| City is one of the best places in town. It's where retailers want to go. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| one constant. Kroger's moving every 10 or 15 years. The second constant is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| Gibbs Drive. It has remained there all this time. You heard Mr. Cloninger talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| about how there are six families there that have been there since the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| have been built. These are houses that were built in the 19-teens in the 1920s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| and that's just six houses. There are a lot of other people. You've got Mr. and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| Mrs. Brennan sitting out there who've been living there probably longer than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| most of us have been alive. There's quite literally hundreds of years of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| continuity and consistency in this neighborhood. I mean, you can't say enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| good things about it. This neighborhood, it's never been like my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| neighborhood. It was down at the heels at one point and it's had to revitalize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| Fountain City and Gibbs Drive is a destination that people want to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| Kroger's has worked with them. The neighborhood has bent over backwards, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| the other hand, to work with them to say, okay, we're fine with these umpteen other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| things that Kroger's wants to do. However, you know, there's a point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| the neighborhood has reached where they said, hey, wait a second. We've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| protect ourselves. If there's an alignment, I'm personally concerned that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| I mean, think if you go north on Broadway, you come into the, no other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| to call it other than the traffic light mess of Broadway, Hotel, Cedar, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3631)|
| 1:00:39| Essary. Okay, if you start to line up those streets, you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| people that are going to cut down Jacksboro to come down Gibbs. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| going to go from Essary to Stanton to Gibbs and come back down. So that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| concern. You also heard, you know, there's, you know, Kroger's is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| they have a concern with head-on collisions. You've heard the statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| since 2003 of the number of traffic accidents there in that vicinity, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| that's one. Except for the people who are, were involved in that accident, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| would humbly submit it's not significant. Is it a problem that really doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| exist? If Kroger's doesn't come to the site, they already own it. $5.7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| million worth of ownership they have. I don't think it will stay vacant. But if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| you think about it this way, if it stays vacant or if it doesn't stay vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| there will still be one empty building in Fountain City. If Kroger's goes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| the new place, the place on Highland, it's going to be vacant. If Kroger's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| doesn't go to this new place, this is going to be vacant. There's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| constant there. That, you know, I don't think, you know, looking at the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| that are to be applied, that I don't think this, this use is compatible with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| the character of the neighborhood, with the siting, the size, and location of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| building. I believe that the use will injure the value of the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| properties with the noise, light, fumes, odors, vibrations, traffic, congestion, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| other impacts that would detract. And that the use is of a nature that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| would draw substantial additional traffic through residential streets. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| understand that in a meeting Kroger's at one point said we could move the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| building. Now someone higher up the food chain, no pun intended, said that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| not the case anymore. Really, no pun intended. But we've got, you know, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| Kroger's is asking this council to do is place a bet, a 100% bet on whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3762)|
| 1:02:53| not they can move that street, or excuse me, move that entrance, whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| they can redesign that building. And they're asking this council to bet on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| the future of Gibbs Drives. Who succeeds or who fails, it's going to be 100%. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| going to be 100% for this neighborhood. I respectfully submit that I'm not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| gambling man, nor should this council. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| Councilman Becker. Thank you. I have a question. I see Jamie Rowe from Fountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3800)|
| 1:03:29| City Town Hall present. And if it's okay, I know you're not signed up to speak, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| this is the area you represent. Just for clarity, I know Fountain City Town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| Hall has sent a letter this afternoon. Kroger said they're not going to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| the store if the driveways don't line up. And I know currently Fountain City Town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| Hall has said you don't want the driveways to line up, the concern for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| Gibbs Drive. I just want to ask you as a president whether you feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| there's a value in Fountain City Town Hall reconsidering its position or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| whether you feel good still saying that Fountain City Town Hall is in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| supportive of the of the appeal. Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike, representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| Fountain City Town Hall. Our bylaws state that we're in the business, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3854)|
| 1:04:21| is a very loose quotation, but the reason that we're formed is to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| neighborhoods be stable and to go forward and to stay the way they are. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3867)|
| 1:04:33| I can't see that another vote would make a difference because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3873)|
| 1:04:40| feel like they're asking for something reasonable, and Town Hall voted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| support the reasonable requests of this neighborhood. So I can't see that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| would do any good to re-vote. Thank you. Councilman Hoekstra. Councilman Woodhull. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| personally don't think we ought to concern ourselves with that comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| about whether or not they'll be there or not. We have a very intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3901)|
| 1:05:09| commercial zone right next to a very tranquil, stable neighborhood, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3909)|
| 1:05:18| trying to make a decision to to maintain both of those two very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| different kind of zones. And so, I mean, it certainly is unfortunate if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| they're going to choose to to move on because of them not getting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| particular turn lane, but the real issue is about protecting the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| making sure that accidents aren't taking place in the street, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3943)|
| 1:05:50| there is a commercial zone that's viable. And I agree with Councilman Frost. I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3950)|
| 1:05:59| not think that... I believe we should support this appeal. I think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| ought to send the bright minds back to the drawing table. Councilman Huckles. I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3966)|
| 1:06:14| very much with Councilman Frost, too, and what I heard him say a short while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| And I look at this, and I think the Kroger Company is pretty shrewd about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| their real estate deals. They used to do a lot of lease, ground lease projects, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| they'd lease for 20 years, and they don't do that much anymore, as far as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| can tell. They pretty much buy their real estate now, and I think they typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| make sure they've got their ducks in a row and know what they want to do. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| have a hard time imagining... I know Mr. Janka is doing the best he can to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| represent his company, but I really have a hard time imagining them spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| $5.7 million on this site and then saying, oh, well, we can't get this relocated entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4017)|
| 1:07:06| therefore, we're going to walk away from it and put it back on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| First of all, I agree with Mr. Frost, it's a high demand area, but this particular site would be a demanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| site for smaller scale retail. And the question is, who are the big boxes, medium boxes to big boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| that would locate on this site? We know that Target already moved closer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| Easttown, or excuse me, Knoxville Center Mall, Washington Pike, that area. And I could be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4050)|
| 1:07:39| I don't see anybody on the horizon ready to move into this facility or this site if they don't occupy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| So I have a hard time believing that Kroger will walk away and put the site on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4065)|
| 1:07:54| for what could be two, three years before it sells at $5.7 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4074)|
| 1:08:00| So I'm not too concerned, I agree with Mr. Frost, whether they stay at Highland Drive or whether they stay here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| they're still going to maintain a presence in the Fountain City market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| It's too viable a market, too valuable for them to walk away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| So clearly they want to invest in this, even with the location next to the new Target, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4093)|
| 1:08:20| So I just really would struggle in finding some justification for, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4100)|
| 1:08:27| for not acknowledging the neighborhood's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| I think they have legitimate concerns and those need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| And I'm not convinced also that all the options have been exhausted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| So I'm going to support this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| I don't have anything really profound to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| but I think Councilman Woodhull has made an extremely good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| This is a very delicate balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| A zone or a district that is not only all of the statements that you made about it are so important and so accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4134)|
| 1:09:03| but it's also a very historic area and a historic neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| And I can remember as a child, and I've probably been around as long as Mr. Brennan has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| but I can remember as a child driving to Fountain City to my grandmother's house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| because she lived on Parkway or sometimes on Fair, some of the time on Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| and really loving that neighborhood and loving driving by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| It's still just a very personal thing with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| but the fact that it has remained all these years and to look at these years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| on this little drawing you gave us is just extremely interesting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| And I think that we can retain both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| And I really feel Kroger is in the people business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| It's in the service business to communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| And I just feel that something can be worked out here that's going to give the community the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4196)|
| 1:10:05| and the opportunity to do business with Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| And at the same time retain this very magic kind of historic neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| which, you know, we can't reproduce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| Kroger stores can be built in this block or that block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| but there is no way to reproduce Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| There is no way to replace the hole that it would be in the heart of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| and in the hearts of the people who have remained there, loved it, and protected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| So I hope something can be worked out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| I'm always a great believer in, you know, if you sit down and talk about it and work through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4243)|
| 1:10:49| something can still happen good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| And I would hope so, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| I know that this is the optimum opportunity that you've put before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| but I'd just like to put a challenge before you to be a good service provider to that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| and to understand how Knoxville values its historic neighborhoods and its treasures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4267)|
| 1:11:15| of which very few remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| I guess, Mr. Woodall, I'm not necessarily saying that I think that we should consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| but I do want to – well, actually I'm saying we should consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| They're saying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| I want to make sure that the neighborhoods, the smart neighborhoods are thinking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| and had conversations with both this afternoon and knew it was going to be said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| but I think bringing them into the discussion as well is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| I want to do a procedural question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| And I'm thinking – my sense, Mr. Frost, is that the appeal impacts your district more than mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4305)|
| 1:11:51| So – but I want to check out a conversation with Mr. Swanson about what we can do on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4311)|
| 1:11:59| And this goes a little bit to maybe calling Kroger's bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| if we think they are going to build there no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| And this is the challenge of what we do with the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| because what we're allowed to do with the appeal when we vote on it is either vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| And if it's approved, the driveways line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| I don't think we want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| If we vote it down, Kroger has to put in a new development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| which means going back to MPC, it's a – potentially a 10-week process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| And what I want to actually suggest procedurally is that we make clear to Kroger what we intend to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4351)|
| 1:12:40| and then give them an opportunity to amend their plan between this meeting and next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| which would allow them, if they are going to build it, to get moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| It would not delay them for 10 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| So rather than approve the appeal to say we're going to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| we'll approve it if we're not happy in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| but we're not going to force Kroger to start over in process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| going to allow them to amend the plan and get moving on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| because, you know, frankly, it could be a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| Again, it's – I think it impacts your district more than mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| but had some thinking on that and wanted to toss that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| Well, I appreciate that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| I particularly appreciate the comments of Councilman Pelo earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| You know, when thinking – I was thinking about, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| they're wanting the driveway to come in front of the Kroger store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| And, you know, Mr. Gianco said, you know, they like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| It's, you know, good for traffic flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| Then I started thinking of all the Kroger's around town where that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| I think of the one in the second district in Bearden right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| where you come in past Starbucks, through the back, and it hadn't failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| and it's actually been recently renovated and expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| Actually, it's getting ready to grow a great deal more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| You have the one in probably the western edge of the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| where I don't think that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| I don't think the one on – in the sixth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| I don't think that happens there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| I'm not sure the one in south Knoxville, that Kroger's has that alignment, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| So I guess my point is, both for this council and for Mr. Gianco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| is that that pattern works well for Kroger's elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| Kroger's has a sizable market share in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| You know, there's a new food city in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| It's big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| I'm not sure Kroger's isn't going to want to relinquish Fountain City to a competitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| I'm optimistic that Kroger's can, you know, go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| Target functioned well for about 20 years with an offset entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| that kind of put you in at the side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| They did fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| I can hear what Councilman Becker is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| I would like to maybe say we need to get some input from Mr. Gianco to see what his thoughts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4506)|
| 1:15:14| I mean, he's going to be, you know, flying by the seat of his pants on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| if this is something that they can redo in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| And also, after hearing from Mr. Gianco, hear from somebody from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| Was that a request of Mr. Gianco?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Would you like to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4532)|
| 1:15:42| Would you like me to restate my name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| No, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| I do want to correct one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| I don't know who ever made a recommendation or a comment that we would actually modify our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| To my knowledge, that has not been said that we would adjust our building either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| So you stated that, sir, and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| I've never said we would adjust our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| I don't have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| I don't know if someone else might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| But I just want to get that straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| Being a fairly new real estate manager to Kroger, I've not seen all their locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| But typically, most of our locations sit back off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| So we have drive aisles to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| Typically, look at Farragut, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| You've got the main road in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| You've got Broadway, which is now Brookline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| There's multiple access points into the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| That's what we strive to create when we're trying to do a unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| But because of the availability of land or lack thereof, we had to fit the building in this way and kind of get it tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4597)|
| 1:16:46| So that's what kind of precipitated the need to have the drive aisle there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| One of the other comments that was raised was, you know, we're getting better at our business and doing leases and owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| If you've looked at our history, we have relocated our units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| But I will tell you, as we are doing this, we are buying our land, we are owning them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| and we are creating a bigger, better unit to service the customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| Can I sit here and tell you that 50 years from now we won't change to another unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| But more than likely, we won't, as we will invest money in other areas of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4638)|
| 1:17:27| The direction I gave was the direction I was given, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| But I'll go back and discuss it, and I don't know that my answer will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| Is there any other questions I need to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| Yeah, I guess the question is, I think you're faced with two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| We can approve the appeal tonight, or we can give you two weeks to amend your development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| I do want to add one more thing, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| This piece of land was zone S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Before I got this project, it was zone SP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| And at the request of MPC, we went through a rezoning process to change it to PC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| I think it's PC1 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| I don't know what precipitated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| That was before I got the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| I'll have to go look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| But we went through this process because you asked us to go through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| and on your closing part, it was a contingency to closing that we get our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| And we got our zoning, so we closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| We didn't know there was an issue on the site plan until afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| So right now my direction is that we will probably market the building and the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| So that's the history behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| It was a specific performance contract after zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| I'm sorry, what was your question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| Do you want to wait two weeks to decide, or do you want us to ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| I mean, you and I talked about this yesterday, day before, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| The procedural question, when we vote on the appeal, it's a yes, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| There's no chance to amend your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| You'd have to go back and start over with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| Would you like us to not actually vote tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| I think it's clear where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| But allow you those two weeks to amend the plan, to relocate the driveway, or do you ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| That would seem a logical thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| I'll go back and ask again and see if the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| I guess my question is, if the answer I come back with in two weeks is the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| what procedure do I need to go through in order to announce that to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| Come back to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| I mean, I guess in a way, you live in Atlanta, so I don't know if your answer is still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| Coming back and forth is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| I'm pretty accustomed to that drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| But thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| If I can, it makes sense to give me the two weeks to go figure it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| and come back before you or send word through you that we're either, yes, going to stay the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| or amend our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| But thank you very much for the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| Councilwoman Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| When you go back, I hope that you will convey the discussion this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| I hope you'll convey the sentiments of this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| I hope you'll convey the information that perhaps you were not aware of before this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4811)|
| 1:20:19| because I think that's crucial to Kroger making a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| I realize it's a business decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| but I started to comment, as Councilman Frost did, about the many different types of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4826)|
| 1:20:37| You know, I don't design parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| I don't design grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| But I can say that we have many successful grocery chains here that have very unusual configurations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4841)|
| 1:20:51| within which they are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| So I think the crucial thing is whether you want to be a part of a wonderful neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| in the Fountain City area, which I think will serve you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| And I think when you go back, I'd like to be in your pocket so I could speak up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| and tell your bosses down there that we appreciate very much their investment in Oxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| We appreciate very much their interest in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| But we really hope that they will provide the consideration that these folks really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4875)|
| 1:21:22| And I think when you come back, we can all have a happy face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| Well, thank you very much for your kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| And I did take very good notes, and I'm almost out of ink on my pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Mr. Frost, you have a question for Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Please go ahead, and then I'll come back to Councilman Hoeklis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| Think about the target there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| The target did well enough until they decided to move out and get a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| The target did well enough as is where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| With the traffic situation that I know you're saying you're going to have a different traffic situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| they did well enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| You know, I'd understand that you all might like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| because this would be like hitting a Grand Slam home run in the bottom of the ninth full count, two out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4927)|
| 1:22:17| And, you know, I think you'll be able to respectfully do well enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4937)|
| 1:22:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Councilman Hoeklis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Mr. Scott or someone from the Gibbs Drive Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| I know you may not have somebody that's speaking officially, or maybe you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| I know you have a co-chair that spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| I'd like to hear from someone in terms of your response to the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| I mean, you all have to show up in force every time this comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| Would you like to step up to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| and give your reaction to the idea of a two-week postponement as suggested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4972)|
| 1:23:01| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| Mr. Gianca, with all due respect, you can't say where Kroger will be 50 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4984)|
| 1:23:12| I can say, well, I won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| I'm too old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| But Gibbs Drive is going to be here 50 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| And I hope you're here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| But we're going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| And I wanted to get that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| Mr. Hoeklis, thank you very much for a couple of functional solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5008)|
| 1:23:35| You pointed out that there is no substantial difference between the 80,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| I think it was 79 actually, thousand square foot Target, and the 80,000 square foot Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| These offset drives worked 25 years from Target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Why can't it work for Kroger's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| I thought your idea about sort of an enhanced in-out with a light at Knox Lane, Fair, and Maple kind of made sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5034)|
| 1:24:06| particularly with the skate park right across the street in the future, hopefully the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5046)|
| 1:24:14| If we're concerned about the safety of our citizens, the safety of our children, boy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| a crosswalk there would do wonders for the students at Central High School and the children in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5059)|
| 1:24:29| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Now, Knox Lane might argue with me there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| All I want to say is as neighborhood association, while there are 30 of us here in force, I cannot speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5076)|
| 1:24:45| I am a lowly co-chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| What I would like to say is that we would be glad to entertain Kroger's amendments, options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5089)|
| 1:25:00| We will hear them whenever, wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| But we do not plan on budging on our request to keep this realignment from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5104)|
| 1:25:13| So you think your folks would probably not object to a postponement as has been proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5113)|
| 1:25:20| The only thing I'm hearing whisperings back here, two weeks from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| Knox County schools are on fall break and I, for one, am going to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| So we might be more inclined to a four-week postponement, particularly if Kroger's is in need of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5131)|
| 1:25:42| I don't know if that's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| Sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| Real quick, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| I would pick up on where a couple of council members have already stated that to Kroger's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| no matter what sort of configuration that you work out with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5153)|
| 1:25:57| I think that they're going to find their way to Kroger's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| And I think it's an exciting project, new jobs, construction jobs, a new store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| And I hope you can work something out because, you know, I think the city of Knoxville, you know, would like to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5167)|
| 1:26:15| And you've heard some concerns and hopefully you can work out some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| I do want to add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| I don't think we can connect to Fairlawn and the streets across because there's about a 15- or 20-foot grade differential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5182)|
| 1:26:30| And I don't know if you're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| There's a big grade differential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| I think you talked about possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| The site is presently graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| If you went straight through GRIB, straight in front of the proposed store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| and you went all the way to the edge of the curb, then there's about a 15- or 20-foot drop before you hit the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| But you don't know for sure if the site could be regraded to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| Well, no, I can tell you that if you did that, you would lose a ton of parking because to grade up to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| you'd have to take everything away from the edges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| And right now we're already at 4.0 parking ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| So I don't see that as a viable alternative to cut through because of the grades you're trying to make up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| Just FYI, I can show you the detailed plans and have an engineer explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| Yeah, well, quick question for you and then an option for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| Four-week postponement is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| Four is perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| Fine, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Mr. Frost, just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Last night I was talking to Mr. Dickinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| This was maybe 10 o'clock last night, and I was very tired about this idea of the procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| And one of the things that started coming out of my mouth, which didn't make much sense then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| but might be clear now, is voting on the negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| If there's a need to send a message to Kroger, we could make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| Mr. Swanson, check me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| We could make a motion to deny the appeal, vote it down as a message to Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5266)|
| 1:27:55| The thing would still be on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| I don't know if we need that, but if the neighborhood folks want some kind of vote at a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| we could vote on something that would still allow a postponement later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| We would vote down a denial of the appeal so nothing would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| Things would still be on the agenda, but it would be a clear vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| I'm not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| I'm not really sure I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| The appeal is the neighborhood's appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| We would vote down the denial on the appeal, but it would send a clear message to Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| I don't know that we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| I'm pretty clear on what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| I understand what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| You got me triple or double negative there where I can't quite figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| I'm not sure that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| I think it's a better idea just to postpone and then come back and decide what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| I think that's the better idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| I understand what he's saying, but I think that's the better idea just to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| I think what he was saying is someone make a motion to turn it down, then that gets voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| but no other motion takes place but a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| After that, it still is alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| That's what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| But I think the better thing to keep it clean is just to go ahead and do the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| Both parties are comfortable with four weeks, and I think that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| I think both parties have heard clearly at least what some of the council members are thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| Is it possible, Mr. Swanson, to excise out part of this just to address the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| or does it have to be considered all together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| This is a whole plan, and that's the subject that's up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| The variance is not up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| The variance may be coming later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| That's not what we have, and that's where you sort of would have the excised portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| But with regard to this, you're talking about the whole plan, and I think you have to deal with the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5377)|
| 1:29:46| If the plan is amended, though, the plan could be approvable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| If the driveway is moved, what would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| Does that make sense, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| I just want to give you one point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| We went through the BZA process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| Everything was approved except for the realignment of the drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| And that's a variance that is now pending, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| So what I'm hearing is perhaps that we need to consider a postponement for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| So I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Motion and second is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| Is there further discussion or questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| I'd just like to briefly say, once again, to Mr. Gianca, Mr. Kirby, thank you for coming, taking copious notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5429)|
| 1:30:37| You heard how a good number of folks on council, not everybody spoke about it, but how a good number spoke about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| and would like to thank Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| And there's probably not a house slide on there tonight because everybody came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| You got 52 homes out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| Thanks for advertising that on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| They're actually armed guards there at Gibbs right now, Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| He has every house covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| Actually, we deputize Lumpy Lambert, who gets well-armed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| The motion is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| Thank you for the good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| 11A is a resolution requesting and encouraging the executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| and the professional staff of the Metropolitan Planning Commission to study, evaluate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| and analyze the feasibility and potential for adopting a comprehensive sidewalk ordinance for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| requested by Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Actually, a motion to postpone takes precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| And the Transportation Mobility Committee is still struggling to find a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| Donna Buckman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| She may want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Struggling to find a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| Her subcommittee has done great work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| The full committee is struggling to find a time that everybody can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| or at least the great majority can meet, and so far we haven't been able to work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| We will get there, but we have not met for the full committee to review this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| and make its recommendation to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| So I think it would be premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| She can speak to it as she'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| My personal opinion is that it would be premature to take any action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| Donna, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| Donna Buckman, 2417 Ridgecrest Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| Yes, the Transportation Mobility Subcommittee has been working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| It has been a bit frustrating not to be able to take what little low-hanging fruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| we've been able to find forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| I'm sitting here really conflicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| and my blood is boiling just a little bit after the previous discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| after I spent meeting after meeting trying to push sidewalks onto Kroger for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5566)|
| 1:32:54| And it was a meeting, and it was another meeting, and it was a Board of Zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| and it was this and it was that, and it was MPC meeting after MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| to get them to put sidewalks in around that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| And now it's going to go back to MPC, and I am seething.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| I am so frustrated with the lack of movement on this council with respect to sidewalks in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| It is just amazing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| Please, please consider putting more effort into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| It's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| Councillor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Well, I agree, and it's part of the reason we want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| I mean, seeing the work that Fountain City Connections did to get one piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| to agree to put in sidewalks clearly convinced me that that's not a way this city can become pedestrian friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| and why I've proposed this and been a big fan of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| And I understand the committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| This was talked about 16 weeks ago, gave you 12 weeks, gave another four-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5635)|
| 1:34:04| Can the committee meet in the next two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| I would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| Councilman Bailey, I know you've been kind of preoccupied, you know, little things like having a baby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| and, you know, presidential campaign, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| But he's got a lot on his plate, and so we've been trying to get this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| and doodling using an online scheduler, et cetera, trying to find times, and it's really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| You know, he's been really busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| I've been busy, but we've been trying to find a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| We've polled the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| We're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| Can I promise you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| Well, I can't 100 percent promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| I think I can get close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| So it's probably worth postponing for two weeks is the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| I guess this comment right here, it's not a comment in favor of a comprehensive sidewalk ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| because with it comes dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| I'm not against one, but I don't know if I'm in total favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| But I am a little concerned that we established these subcommittees, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| such as the Transportation Mobility Committee, and I get a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| I just want to make a general comment that I hope we'd be very careful about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| after we establish some of these committees, then other ancillary issues that come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| that may be subtext of the broader definition of that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| like transportation and mobility all of a sudden get sidelined because it now has, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| taken under its scope everything that has to do with walking, riding, you know, bicycles, greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5729)|
| 1:35:36| You know, we need to be very careful that we don't inadvertently end up having a second council, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| or a second group of folks that everything has to be filtered through that deals with anything about sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| or transportation or bicycles or greenways and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| I think we're going on a slippery slope there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| So while I understand this is a very good committee that wants to be involved here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| I have a little concern that we just need to be very careful as a council that we don't inadvertently end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| deferring as we set up these other subcommittees all sorts of issues to them that really slow down governing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| and trying to move processes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| And that's not a statement that we need a quick comprehensive sidewalk ordinance that we've got to fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| but it's a statement that let's just be very careful that we're not creating another layer of bureaucracy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| and approval process that actually will slow down us making progress in the city on some issues that we can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| progress on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| I think was there actually a motion made to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| I didn't hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| There wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| I don't think there was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| There's a motion and a second on the floor to approve, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| Well, I'll make a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| The motion is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| Further discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| That item does take precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| That motion does take precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| One, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| You know, could I just comment to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Because, you know, I'm supposed to be on that subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| And I'm sorry that the dates and times for those meetings that have been set forth have all been dates that just have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5826)|
| 1:37:14| in total conflict with things that I already have scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| So it isn't a lack of interest, which I think was sort of alluded to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| But it is just simply the inability to be able to work with schedules that other people put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| Everybody's busy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| That's why it's been so hard to schedule the full committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| Everybody's just really busy and got a lot of conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| And just for the record, my vote was one that I think I was hoping my vote is that I don't see any problem with us moving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5856)|
| 1:37:44| off our plate while the Transportation and Mobility Committee moves along and MPC could be doing some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| And those could be dual tracks tracking along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| We could at least move it off our plate and into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| So that was the reason my vote, no, not that I don't think the Transportation and Mobility Committee should not comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| or take a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| But I just think that we could have had an opportunity to maybe move it at least one step off our plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=5884)|

| 1:44:24| There should be some folks lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| We do have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6266)|

| 1:44:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| I'm Terri Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| I live at 417-8 Ridgeway Lane, 37919, and I've been representing the Bearden Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6280)|
| 1:44:47| on the Citywide Neighborhood Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| I've said before that after 40-plus years of working with different community issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6292)|
| 1:45:00| that this has been the most supportive neighborhood council that I've ever worked with, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6300)|
| 1:45:06| want to say again how much we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| You've given us traffic calming, you've supported the definition of family, and now you've supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6309)|
| 1:45:15| another very important neighborhood in the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| And also, we appreciate you initiating a request for a regulation of parking in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6320)|
| 1:45:29| yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| That's a much-needed ordinance that will give another overlay of protection to our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| And we want to thank each and every one of you for your unanimous decision to entrust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6337)|
| 1:45:45| the Citywide Neighborhood Coalition group on this task for 14 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6345)|
| 1:45:52| It's been an interesting and pleasant and enlightening journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| And I'd like to ask all of the folks who've worked on this to stand, and we lost a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| that had to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| They hadn't had their dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| I also want to thank all the city representatives who worked with us on this, and many of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6371)|
| 1:46:19| attended every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Some of them attended only one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| But we appreciated every bit of counsel and advice that they gave to us during this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| and they are Sharon Boyce, Anita Cash, Robert Moyers, David Brace, David McGinley, Stephanie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6390)|
| 1:46:37| Brewer-Cook, David Massey, and Eve Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| You have a packet before you of our work product and some accompanying information, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6403)|
| 1:46:51| added two more sheets to that and some more photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| The two pages had some corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| One, we added some more neighborhoods to the list of folks that worked with us on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| and we added another umbrella organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| This is my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| I typed this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| I forgot to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| Community Forum also supported this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6435)|
| 1:47:22| The additional paper that you have that we gave to you tonight is a recommendation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6442)|
| 1:47:30| City Council tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| We urge City Council to approve this work product, which Council members task our Citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| Neighborhood Coalition to prepare on first reading, and that it be referred back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| to begin the process towards adoption as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| We also urge that during this process, City Council will schedule a workshop to resolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6472)|
| 1:47:58| any other remaining issues, such as legal language, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6478)|
| 1:48:05| And we hope that you will feel that you can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6490)|

| 1:48:12| Jim Blentner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6492)|
| 1:48:22| I'm representing the Kings and Pikes Sequoia Hills Association in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6502)|
| 1:48:29| Mayor Haslam and Council, I want to assure you of a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| First of all, every effort was made to make this process as inclusive as possible with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| And from the impressive list that you see, you will understand that this was certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| a citywide effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| Not only were the efforts made by the coalition, but also by the Office of Neighborhoods, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| we appreciated their help in turning out some more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| In addition, we met in all areas of the city, so that if there were those people who would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| have a tough time getting to meetings because of location or something like that, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| would be able to accommodate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| Numerous meetings that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| The meetings were sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| That allowed several City Council members to come on a regular basis, and some on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| occasional basis, and we appreciated the efforts that they made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| But it also allowed us to have input from ordinary citizens, and we had several of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| who came to meetings and put input in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| And we want you to know that we considered their complaints or their interests that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| had, concerns that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| I want you to know that we also took into account the concerns that were voiced when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| we met for the first time 14 weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| And there were several that were brought up that we certainly think we have been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| to accommodate in this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| Now, I think you need to understand that this was a situation that was very enlightening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6592)|
| 1:49:59| to all of us, and as Terry said, I think it was a situation that we all benefited from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| participating in, because what we found is that we all have common problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| It didn't matter from what part of town you were from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| We all had the same problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| And without question, the parking in the front yard was one that we all agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| It is a common problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| And we have many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| In fact, we had one gentleman that was complaining about city services, and he wasn't from my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| But when he left early, I said, you know, I could have been at a Sequoia Hills Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| Pack Association meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| I hear the same complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| And we all said the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| So I think that we are in this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| I think you need to know that as we went through this process, that every concern was scrutinized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6639)|
| 1:50:46| we talked and reviewed these concerns time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6646)|
| 1:50:53| They'd ruminate for a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| We'd come back the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| We'd review it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| We'd come back the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| Somebody was there who had missed a meeting, and they had a different slant on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| or there had been some extra thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| And so this process evolved over these 14 weeks, and sometimes it went back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6664)|
| 1:51:10| as we considered the different ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| But it was given a thorough review, and we were able to come to consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6672)|
| 1:51:21| Frankly, I doubt that there has been any ordinance that has been looked at any more intensely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| than this one has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| Fourteen weeks of weekly meetings, sometimes more than one meeting in a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| sometimes subcommittee groups meeting to try to get things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| And I doubt that there's ever been a more diverse group from all over the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6697)|
| 1:51:44| that has ever sat down and exchanged ideas over an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| It was a wonderful experience, a great learning experience for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| That said, we come to you tonight knowing that as we look at this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| and you look at it again, there may well be some changes that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| We are asking for the workshop because we know that it needs to be looked at again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6724)|
| 1:52:11| We know that Mr. Swanson will say that it needs to go back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6731)|
| 1:52:16| and we will appreciate what they would have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| They'll certainly have another slant to look at it and may add some and refine it some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| I understand that we have some people who are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| I wish they had been able to make some of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| We might have alleviated some of those fears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| But their concerns need to be heard, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6751)|
| 1:52:33| So that's why we're asking for the workshop in this process as we go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| And we understand that, you know, that there are some potential problems that the legal department has raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6759)|
| 1:52:46| with Law Director Poplin that may be some things that we --| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6766)|
| 1:52:52| some language may need to be tweaked a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| And I think that we are all -- in fact, we voted at our last meeting that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| as long as the intent of this ordinance stays the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| that we are all comfortable with whatever tweaks need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| There has been one question that we raised at the last meeting, which we talked about a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| and that was the area of cost and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| Well, let me just voice my opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| And we talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| You know, will it cost a little bit to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| Probably very negligible, maybe a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| But what do we gain from it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Well, the objectives of this ordinance, and I want to thank Beth Needham from Old Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| Old Knox, North Knox, for summarizing these for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| She did a great job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| And you have a copy of that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| Thirty more seconds, Mr. Putnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6819)|
| 1:53:40| She has a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| But obviously what we think will happen is that the property values are going to be enhanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6821)|
| 1:53:48| ultimately, by this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| And by enhancing those property values, you're going to get more property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| So I would -- no, you're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| Can we quote you on that next time you run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| Not how reappraisals work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| But anyway, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| So anyhow, we believe that ultimately that we will keep neighborhoods from deteriorating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| that we'll be able to revitalize neighborhoods and also protect city assets such as curbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6848)|
| 1:54:13| and sidewalks that can be destroyed or damaged by parking when people drive over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| So ultimately, if there is some small investment that's needed to help with enforcement on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| we think you'll see the returns from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| So we ask that you, as Ms. Faulkner suggested, we ask that you move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6869)|
| 1:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| Speedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| Mr. Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| I'm John Speedy Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| And I've lost my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| I'm John Speedy Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| 2315 Monterey Road here in Knoxville, and I am thoroughly opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6892)|
| 1:54:59| As a gentleman said a while ago, it's great to be an American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| Well, part of being American is to own property, the right to own property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| and do pretty much what you want to with that property as long as the old saying goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| if it's not illegal, immoral, or fattening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| Now, in the neighborhood I live in, it's not Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6915)|
| 1:55:21| It's not Fox Dens, but it is a very nice neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| It is an older neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| I think we've got three people there that are self-employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| The rest of us old coots are retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| And we pretty much do what we need to do, and nobody complains about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6933)|
| 1:55:43| There is no loud music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| There are no cars running up and down the street speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6944)|
| 1:55:50| The situation is, like I said, it's an older neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6950)|
| 1:55:55| One car garage, one car carport, started out young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| Now, there is two and three cars in the yard because there's one garage, one small driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6961)|
| 1:56:10| They've got no place else to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| It is not fair because somebody lives in an older neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| don't have the facilities to park a vehicle that you start stepping on their toes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6981)|
| 1:56:29| and forcing them to build a double driveway or whatever it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| The Today's Prices Act cost a heck of a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| Besides, it's their yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| I don't care what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| I'm against this, and I'm not even affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| Those who know me know that I've got a garage behind my house that will hold a fleet of cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| So I'm not affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| I'm just against it because it is dead wrong to tell somebody they can't park their car that they paid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7015)|
| 1:57:03| in their yard that they're paid for and they're paying taxes on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| because they have got nowhere else to park it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| Now, the comment was made a while ago that it was a serene neighborhood, very quiet neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7034)|
| 1:57:22| Well, we've got the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| We don't need somebody coming up, you need to move that car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7045)|
| 1:57:32| That's not what we need in that neighborhood that we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| Besides that, North Knoxville, West Haven, Oak Ridge area, people at the county sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7056)|
| 1:57:50| and Knoxville law enforcement office does not have enough people to patrol that with all the cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| trucks, boats, and motorcycles parked in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| There's a guy that lives down the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| He has got a boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| To get it behind his house, he's got to make a 90-degree turn to the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| make another 90-degree turn to the side, which he does in the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| In the summertime, it sits in his yard because he's trying to wire the thing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| He is gone just about every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| It would take him an hour to get the boat out if it was any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| One more minute, Mr. Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| It's quick enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| This ordinance is totally and completely unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7107)|
| 1:58:34| Please vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| If it happens way over here, that's one thing, take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| If it happens way over there, take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| But dad-blame-it, don't kill all the dogs because one's got fleas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| Mr. Weaver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7132)|
| 1:59:02| I came here because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| I'm sorry, I need your name and address first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| Ken Weaver, 4310 Ellen Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| I came here because I see some ulterior motives in some of these things that have been going on in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7149)|
| 1:59:20| Number one is the possible benefit that some people might derive who own the news sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7160)|
| 1:59:30| forcing people not to be able to advertise their car on their front lawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7170)|
| 1:59:37| and automobile dealerships that might want to force you to take your car to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7177)|
| 1:59:46| so you can't sell it on your front lawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| That's the money trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| Then there's this law enforcement point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| I called the police to somebody beating in the side of a garage behind my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7198)|
| 2:00:07| It took them two days to send somebody to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| and people want law enforcement to tell somebody to move their car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7213)|
| 2:00:20| when they can't respond in two days to an in-progress call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7220)|
| 2:00:30| This is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| I talked to a lady over here at the Burger King in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7233)|
| 2:00:39| A policeman told her son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| you can't work on your car in your driveway that you own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7242)|
| 2:00:49| This isn't something law enforcement needs to be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7249)|
| 2:00:57| We are not here to live in a cookie-cutter world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| as if we all belong to some condo association living in some little block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7263)|
| 2:01:12| a 19-foot wide specified width for your driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7272)|
| 2:01:19| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| When are you going to get Paris Hilton down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| to tell us we have to have a chartreuse lamppost next to that driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7286)|
| 2:01:35| This is a usurpation of our property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| and how dare anybody tell me where I can park my car that I own on my land that I own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7301)|
| 2:01:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7311)|
| 2:01:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| Deputy Chief Rayl, do you all enforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| I mean, this is a zoning, proposed zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7318)|
| 2:02:02| Does the police department enforce any zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7322)|
| 2:02:08| We actually have codes that handle the majority of the zoning issues that we can enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7328)|
| 2:02:16| Codes and zoning enforcement enforces this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7338)|
| 2:02:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| Yeah, well, I guess I just want to, one, sort of amplify what the first two speakers were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7344)|
| 2:02:29| and how good a process this was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| It was a lot of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| They were sweet to say that the three council people who showed up were Mr. Holquist, Ms. Pilo, and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7352)|
| 2:02:38| and sometimes we couldn't get a word in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| So you can imagine how long some of those meetings were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| I want to actually suggest a process on this that we follow the neighborhood's suggestion in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| and have a workshop to talk more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| I think before we send this back to MPC, I want council to understand what's in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| I mean, I think some of the concerns we heard from those opposed have actually been addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7378)|
| 2:03:02| in the proposed ordinance coming, and I think we need to talk about this for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| And I think that gets us a clearer message to ask MPC to work on if we're clear on what is in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| and we're clear about what we like and don't like about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| So I want to suggest that from moving forward, we have a workshop on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7397)|
| 2:03:21| and I guess postpone what's actually on the agenda now, although I don't know that it's even particularly important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7401)|
| 2:03:28| to have what's on the agenda now on the agenda, but we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| So are you making a motion yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| I have a tendency to agree if I heard him correctly because my problem with it is we're voting on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7417)|
| 2:03:44| that we're going to send automatically straight back to MPC that's not really our intent to get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7424)|
| 2:03:51| So I would prefer that we just send it back to MPC or have a workshop or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7431)|
| 2:03:56| because the group did come up with some good suggestions that they would like to see included in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7436)|
| 2:04:05| I just have a problem with voting on something on first reading that's not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7445)|
| 2:04:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| Councilman Hucklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| I'm not sure if I understand because if we vote on first reading and then have a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| we can still amend in second reading based on the workshop, and that's where I'm not clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7461)|
| 2:04:29| We don't have to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| I mean, we don't have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| We can send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| We can have a workshop and then send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7479)|
| 2:04:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| Councilman Pila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| I'd like to ask Mr. Swanson a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| If we approve this work product that's before us, and that's basically what it is, on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7485)|
| 2:04:55| and then we have a workshop and there need to be alterations to the content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7495)|
| 2:05:03| then what would then be the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| Would it still be to send it to MPC, or what do we talk about substantive changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| I'm confused about that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| You have a workshop and have substantive changes to what is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7515)|
| 2:05:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| And you'd have to send those substantive changes back to MPC for MPC's review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| and then it would come back to you from MPC with their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| Then it would appear that to pass it on first reading would be of little benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7528)|
| 2:05:34| But having the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| There's really very little utility in passing it on first reading if you're going to send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| I guess the other thing to keep in mind, what's before us isn't what the Neighborhood Association proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7551)|
| 2:05:52| And it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| I'd actually look on that 18-foot wide driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| That actually has been taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| That was something that MPC considered, and the new draft is considerably different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| So I guess I'm going to go ahead, and I know Mr. Brown is late on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| but make a motion that we postpone this for four weeks to give us time to have a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7566)|
| 2:06:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7575)|
| 2:06:16| Motion is to postpone for four weeks and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| Vice Mayor Brown, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| And I guess it is to the motion to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| And I understand exactly what Mr. Swanson is saying, and I think he's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7584)|
| 2:06:29| If what I hear we're talking about doing is to occur that a passage on first reading would be a little benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| But the problem I have is, you know, and if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| when we first decided we were going to send this to a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| and ask a bunch of community individuals and neighborhood organizations to get involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| I think I said at that time, we must be very careful as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| about asking folk to do this kind of work and having expectations raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| and then it comes back to us and we send it off to NPC or somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| And we're doing that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| And I think to a degree, at least in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| it's a little disrespectful of the 14 weeks and numerous work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| and all this stuff that these folk have done that we asked them to do a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| You know, and at that time I said we've got to be careful about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| So my only concern is while I see we're going to refer this thing back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| whether we have it on first reading or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| we must find a way to say, and I'm just going to say it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| that we appreciate all the hard work you guys have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| We appreciate what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| I hope that your expectations, the expectations that you had with regard to this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| are not somehow doused or diminished because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| But where I was concerned about us being when we first decided to get all these good volunteers working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7655)|
| 2:07:42| and all this hard work and energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| and then somehow to me it's just a little disrespectful not to at least do what they ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7664)|
| 2:07:50| You know, we pass things on first reading all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| and we make statements we're going to vote on this on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| and we might not vote on it on second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| or we don't vote it on first reading to have another look and have a workshop in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| So we have done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| And I think if we let the neighborhoods know that we're doing it maybe out of respect to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| but ultimately they understand it's going to be a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| It's going to go back to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| It also will hopefully get all the kinds of suggestions that you all have put into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| So I was really kind of leaning towards having the vote while it would be of little benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| I want to find a way to say to them, thank you for all this hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| because I was very concerned that we're going to be where we are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7705)|
| 2:08:28| and have had them do all this hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| And now we're basically almost saying, well, we're going to scrap that and toss it to the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| and we're going to go ahead and send it back to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| So I guess that's me being on my soapbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| I'm going to say personally, I didn't, as Council Member Becker pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| I didn't attend any of those meetings, but I do appreciate all the hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| and I know how much hard work went into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| And I want to make sure that you guys know that I think we all appreciate that and what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7728)|
| 2:08:53| I hope you don't take this as some sort of disrespect or feel that you've all wasted your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| spun your wheels, gone through this long process only to have it maybe disregarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7738)|
| 2:09:02| I'm going to look at what your work product is, and when we ultimately get back to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| I'm going to make sure that I take a look at it very carefully whether I vote for it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| And this is really a statement of respect for what you guys have done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| and not one really for or against the ordinance, but what you guys have done in the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| And I'm just a little concerned about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| how we're going about showing our respect for it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| Councilwoman Pillow, I'm not sure who's next, but I'll go to you, and then I'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| I would appreciate getting to respond to that, because Councilman Brown, Vice Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| you have hit the nail on the head as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| A great deal of work has gone into this, not just with the couple of people who have spoken for this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7775)|
| 2:09:41| but, you know, for the, I guess, 40 or 50 people who have attended those sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| and really sincerely tried to work out something that is a very positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7786)|
| 2:09:56| something for the future which is very positive for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| The thing that concerns me, if we just send it to MPC without approving the work product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| as the task force or committee has requested, is where does that work product go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7807)|
| 2:10:14| Because, basically, it is not in the original ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7814)|
| 2:10:19| So there is, it seemed to me, the only way to have that work product considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7819)|
| 2:10:27| which I think it is only fair to this group that's worked so hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| to have these ideas, this compilation of people's interests and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7831)|
| 2:10:38| and the way in which they feel that this can best be put into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7838)|
| 2:10:45| I think that needs seriously to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| I see no way to do that if we don't approve the work product on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7848)|
| 2:10:55| Can we, I mean, I realize that the ordinance is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| but basically somehow we have to get this into the record so it can be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7859)|
| 2:11:04| It has already been, already the group who worked on this has been informed that the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7864)|
| 2:11:13| would like very much to have some time to sit down with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| and discuss some of the aspects of this that need some consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| And I think it's very important for this group to be able to have that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| so that they can be prepared to respond and to appreciate those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| that the administration would like to discuss with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| So we've got to find a way that all of this effort is not lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7897)|
| 2:11:45| understanding that it is not going to be law as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| but it is going to be a part of the consideration which MPC then will look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7910)|
| 2:11:56| But I really, we must have the meeting, I feel, with the leadership of this group that has worked so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7916)|
| 2:12:05| and with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| That is crucial to point MPC in the right direction when they receive the task of trying to sort through all of this for us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7927)|
| 2:12:18| I don't know how to get us there, but can anybody follow my rambling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| Councilman Becker is raising his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7944)|
| 2:12:25| He can save us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7945)|
| 2:12:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7946)|
| 2:12:27| See, the problem we've got is the ordinance that came to us is not what we like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7947)|
| 2:12:30| So if we postpone it, it's just, in a way, it's interesting Mr. Weaver's comment about the 18-foot-wide driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7950)|
| 2:12:36| Anybody in the public that's looking at this is seeing the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| What it sounds like we need to do, and Mr. Swanson, check me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| is we need on the next agenda item, we need a resolution asking MPC to consider the proposal from the neighborhood committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7962)|
| 2:12:53| And that would become the agenda thing that we would debate that would put this on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7973)|
| 2:12:59| would allow us to have the workshop would be about that as opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| It seems to me it would be a whole lot easier just to refer this matter back to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7984)|
| 2:13:08| and furnish them with the work product of the committee with that and ask them to consider that, which they would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7988)|
| 2:13:16| But I want to get, I'm glad Mr. Weaver came to the meeting and Mr. Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=7996)|
| 2:13:22| I want to get something on that says this is what we're considering, because, again, this isn't it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| and we want to have the workshop at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| So have you got what you want them to consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8011)|
| 2:13:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| Then just, all you need to do is send that with your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8013)|
| 2:13:37| It's not just MPC to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| It's also the folks like Mr. Hatton and Mr. Weaver, the public that's paying attention to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8019)|
| 2:13:44| So they've got the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| So it's a public workshop, but also we have to somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| I thought I had an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| Very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| Let's keep some sense of order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8034)|
| 2:13:55| Let me go to Councilman Hollinick and I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| Well, I understand what Ms. Pelos is trying to say, but the ordinance that we're voting on doesn't have the work product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8038)|
| 2:14:05| that they produced in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| And that's the reason I raised the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| Let's don't vote on anything, a postponement or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| until we understand what it is that we need to send forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| And if we don't send forward the 14 weeks, and I can't tell you how many hours of work that this group has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8056)|
| 2:14:24| then, you know, that was all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| I agree with Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| It's very disrespectful to them, since we commissioned them kind of with that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8068)|
| 2:14:33| Now, we've got to find the right way, parliamentarily, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| Well, actually, I think, and I find myself agreeing with Councilman Becker again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| I actually think that we have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8081)|
| 2:14:48| We postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| We have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| Then we come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| We may come up with some additional recommendations and send what the group, the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8092)|
| 2:14:58| whatever you want to call it, has come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| Plus, if there's another point or two that we come up with at a workshop, send all that back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8100)|
| 2:15:05| let them consider all that stuff, and then we put in the orders, and then we vote on it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8105)|
| 2:15:11| How about you amend the ordinance that's currently before you to include the work product of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8111)|
| 2:15:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8119)|
| 2:15:20| Great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| And then, after you've done that, after you've made that amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| then you move to refer all of that back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| Have a workshop and refer it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| Let's try to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| Let him state that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8135)|
| 2:15:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| I would have tried to have done this ten minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8138)|
| 2:15:40| I received in the mail, like all members of city council, a copy of the work product of the groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8140)|
| 2:15:47| that worked innumerable hours on this, which I'm greatly appreciative of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| I've read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| I've certainly considered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| I would like to make that a part of the record for this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8155)|
| 2:16:00| and I would like to move to amend the item before us to include the work product of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8160)|
| 2:16:09| I think we have one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| I think the motion on the floor right now is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| The second withdrawn to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| Who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| I don't remember who's second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| Steve, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Steve withdrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| Now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| I'll second Mr. Frost's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8183)|
| 2:16:24| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| Mr. Frost just made the motion, and Vice Mayor Brown seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8188)|
| 2:16:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8190)|
| 2:16:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| Now we're discussing Councilman Frost's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| So any discussions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| Ms. Feeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| Well, we still have the issue of the workshop, which I just think is very, very critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| Let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| Do we need to include that in the motion somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| I don't think we necessarily need to do that because we can have workshops at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| whether it's directed by this body or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| I think we vote on this amendment and then have a motion to send it back to MPC with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8213)|
| 2:16:58| a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8218)|
| 2:16:59| That's got to come after this is voted on anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| And so after we get this voted on, then the next motion is to refer it back to MPC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| also with a request for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| It should be fine, well, and good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| Sounds just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| So call for the question on the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| I don't see any other lights, so I think we're ready to vote on that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081007?start=8238)|
