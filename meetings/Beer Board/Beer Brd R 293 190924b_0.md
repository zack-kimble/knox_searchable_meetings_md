| 0:05:47| I'm going to need a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| May I just ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Sure, you can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| They've been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| It's been postponed since February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| Sergeant Gower, can you give us an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| It's my understanding that they're working with the IRS and federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| to get whatever's wrong with their Social Security numbers straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| Do you have an update, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| I might be able to elaborate a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| The folks representing them said, I think it was yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| that they have gotten the problem resolved with the IRS taxpayer advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| And I guess that, according to them, has filtered down to the IRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| and then the Social Security Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| but not yet to the Homeland Security Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| which I guess is the connection that's made on the records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| So they're working it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| And they've been in communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| So I will make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| Until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Until October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293190924b?start=410)|
