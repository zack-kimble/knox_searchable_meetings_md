| 1:20:32| we will reconvene zoning at 835. We have a number of individuals signed up to speak at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4832)|
| 1:20:47| the public forum regarding items 89 and 90. So if there's no objection we will go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4847)|
| 1:20:59| and allow individuals to come and speak. We'll allow up to three minutes for each speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| and I will call them in the order that we received them through signing up through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| commission office. The first speaker is Brad Russell. Let me ask you, is everyone who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4873)|
| 1:21:22| going to speak tonight been sworn by the law director? If not, if anyone who hasn't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| would you please stand? Anyone who's going to speak at public forum? Okay we have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| or two Mr. Morton. If you haven't been sworn yet and you plan to come up to this microphone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| and speak to the commission, please raise your right hand. You solemnly swear or affirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| the testimony you're about to give me the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| truth so help you God. I do. Okay. Thank you Mr. Moyers. Mr. Russell if you'll state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4904)|
| 1:21:51| name and county of residence you have up to three minutes sir. Brad Russell 612 Dry Hollow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| Road Knoxville, Tennessee. Before I start talking I just want to say one thing. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| group is not against all development. I mean we're for. He's speaking to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4919)|
| 1:22:06| We're not against all development. We want, I mean we're for reasonable growth. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| not against, we're not saying we don't want any houses here. I just want to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| clear to everybody up front before I say anything else. But I thank you for listening to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| again tonight. The statement was made in the February meeting that the sector plan is old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| and outdated. The age of a rule or regulation shouldn't determine its importance. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4944)|
| 1:22:31| our constitution is over ten years old. Knox Engineering was questioned about the grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| that had been done on the property. The statement was made my staff did not see anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| that constituted a grading permit. Knox County even said they had visited this site multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| times. Only a few months later TDEC officials visited this same site and found over five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| acres of land that had been disturbed. Nothing had been changed. I mean no more work had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| been done. This is all, this information is on the public TDEC website for anybody who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| wants to see it. For some reason Gleason Drive out in West Knoxville was mentioned as being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| an area of similar characteristics as Suburban Pike. Gleason Drive has a wide turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| sidewalks on both sides. Suburban Pike doesn't even have a road shoulder in some areas where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| this development is going to be. It was stated in February that our local fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| has been updated to handle new developments and growth. I personally spoke with John Linsenbegler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| who is the fire chief and executive administrator for the volunteer fire department in South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| Knoxville. He informed me that his opinion has never been asked by anyone regarding any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| of these developments. Our community has built back fences, bulldozed by this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| Our commissioner has built back fences bulldozed by this developer. Why is this okay? We strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| feel that Thunder Mountain is even bribing Knox County by plainly stating on page two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| of the lease agreement that the rent will be lowered each time property is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| and sold by Thunder Mountain. This farm was knowingly purchased as being zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5041)|
| 1:24:09| Rezoning recently purchased property with the intent to change the character of an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| is not a land rights issue. Our community is already bleeding from what this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| has done with no regret or apology given. They have shown you and our community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| they do not care. They postponed their case in April so that they could meet with us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| alleviate some concerns of the surrounding community. That never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5068)|
| 1:24:39| Abraham Lincoln said, the government is of the people, for the people, and by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5079)|
| 1:24:46| The people here in this room tonight are asking that you decline or drastically reduce this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| train wreck of a development in South Knoxville. And y'all are sitting behind a sign that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| agriculture, by the way. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| Thank you, Mr. Russell. Dawn Close is our next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| I'm going to substitute and have another person speak for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5112)|
| 1:25:26| Ma'am, if you'll state your name and your county of residence, you have up to three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| My name is Shirley Brinkman and I live on Widener Road in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| And everything throughout this debate has been covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| Could you pull the microphone down a little bit, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| I'm sorry. Everything has been covered. I pretty much think why we don't want this type of a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| One is the school is going to be overcrowded, growth sector violation, wildlife being displaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| and damage to our natural waterways. What has not been discussed is the fact that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5152)|
| 1:25:59| necessary medical facilities to cover this kind of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5159)|
| 1:26:08| Recently, I've experienced this within my own family. I've had two of my older brothers go to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| One was literally in the emergency lobby from 6 o'clock Sunday afternoon until 6.30 Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5174)|
| 1:26:23| And people talk in the lobby to each other. And he asked one of them, how long have you been here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| They had already been there 12 hours. These hospitals are understaffed, overworked, overburdened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5190)|
| 1:26:38| You're going to talk about building houses that are going to bring in over 1,000 children. Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5198)|
| 1:26:47| I mean, we've got one children's hospital in Knoxville and it services all of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| most of East Tennessee, probably most of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| And if these parents have children, I don't know of a kid yet that hasn't been to the hospital at least once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5216)|
| 1:27:05| for some injury or other before they're in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| You're talking about 1,000 kids. Who's going to take care of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| The ambulance service. A few months ago, I had to call an ambulance at 6.30 in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5232)|
| 1:27:21| to take me to the hospital. And because they were so overwhelmed with calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| after 45 minutes I asked my sister to take me to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| The ambulance showed up at my house at 8.30 and said we were just overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| And forgive me for being so scattered, but something's just got to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| If you're going to ask for this increase for economic growth or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| then we need those facilities to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5269)|
| 1:27:55| I'm not trying to disqualify the hospital staff or any other professional field that's in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5275)|
| 1:28:03| I'm just saying that they're understaffed and they cannot keep up with the demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| that this is going to bring into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| What are we going to do about our school systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| One of the first things that people who are going to buy a house says is what kind of school system do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5298)|
| 1:28:25| Are they up to date? What's the student-teacher ratio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| What kind of growth potential is there for my child at this school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5309)|
| 1:28:37| What can you do for my child?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| And forgive me again, we just cannot accommodate the kind of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5323)|
| 1:28:51| If you're going to invite this kind of growth to an area, don't you need to be prepared for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5331)|
| 1:28:57| We need better schools. We definitely need better roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| I mean, Chapman Highway is just overloaded as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| And the local roads that are within this growth area will not support any more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5345)|
| 1:29:12| It just won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| So again, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| But I really wish you all would at least lower the density on this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| Thank you, Ms. Cramer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5365)|
| 1:29:32| Margie Grace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| I'm going to give my time to Wanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5381)|
| 1:29:52| Yes, ma'am, if you'll state your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| Wanda Julian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| I'll give you a little bit more than three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5399)|
| 1:30:07| My comments tonight are very pertinent to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| However, I want to address some comments that were made by Commissioner Daley in the meeting of February 22, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5412)|
| 1:30:20| I was going to speak that evening and address Commissioner Daley's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| but the hour was getting late and I was not afforded time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| Commissioner Daley reported that the people of South Knoxville had requested more restaurants and businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| and we now have those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| We have Starbucks, new restaurants, Covenant Health is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| There's other new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| And he stated that development was necessary to support these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| We do not agree with those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| However, I would like to point out that those new businesses are on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| They're not on Abner Cruise Road or Marine Road or Henry Haynes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| They're not even on Kimberlin Heights Road, which is a two-lane, fairly straight road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5461)|
| 1:31:09| Henry Haynes, Marine Road, Abner Cruise Road, those roads are very much like severable pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| They're two lanes, narrow, and they're curvy, and they're dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| These businesses that we do have are located beside Chapman Highway with direct pullouts to Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| or on an access road running parallel and in proximity with Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5486)|

| 1:33:13| You have three minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5593)|

| 1:33:24| Mr. Chairman, commissioners, thank you very much for this opportunity to address you about this important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| The Foundation for Global Sustainability, of which I am the president, urges the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| to deny the request to rezone the core area of the historic Twin Springs Farm in Dry Hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5617)|
| 1:33:46| Planning staff and planning commission did not realize the significance of this area as a historic cultural landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5626)|
| 1:33:54| Consequently, they failed to analyze and address in a comprehensive fashion how this case affects important natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5634)|
| 1:34:02| and historical assets as directed by the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| I didn't know much about this either, but I was slightly more aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| I have been enamored with this scenic beauty since first seeing it 35 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| and particularly after going there a few times 24 years ago for business with a company at the historic Camel Factory Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5661)|
| 1:34:32| When I saw this request show up on the planning commission agenda, I started looking into the history of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5672)|
| 1:34:39| but could not find much at the East Tennessee History Center or Knox Heritage, nor the Tennessee Historical Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5679)|
| 1:34:49| I was told there has been no historical survey of this area since the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| But after weeks of tedious research, I know quite a bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5695)|
| 1:35:04| and I know that this property is an integral part of a forgotten Knox County heritage area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| that has a unique historical, cultural, economic, and ecological values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5710)|
| 1:35:18| We beg you to at least send this request back to planning staff for more detailed analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5718)|
| 1:35:27| Knox County has promoted and engaged in placemaking for three decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| as an important part of fostering community identity, mutuality, and quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5732)|
| 1:35:39| But somehow we have overlooked this place and its exquisite potential to be a place that we can remember and that has a lot of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5739)|
| 1:35:52| This property connects the 19th century Lofty Springs Stagecoach Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5752)|
| 1:36:01| Most importantly, it was a relay between Knoxville and Sevierville for the horses to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5761)|
| 1:36:10| The horses were running all galop for the entire stretch, so they had to use three pairs of horses to get to Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5770)|
| 1:36:20| On the other side, we have the camel factory area that was known as the factory on the farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| which was an important part of the South Knox County economy and even Sevierville and Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5787)|
| 1:36:36| because it employed mostly farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| It was a 700-acre farm that Benjamin Alleman Bauer had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5799)|
| 1:36:46| He went to World War I as a farmer, and he came back and became the owner of this factory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5806)|
| 1:36:56| which made tents and canoes for the United States Armed Forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| It is the oldest of those suppliers still, and they were the most important one of them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5822)|
| 1:37:10| There is hardly any veteran who has slept in a tent, not in a camel tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5830)|
| 1:37:18| Many of those who were in Vietnam, they still passed away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| and most of those from the Second World War aren't among us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5842)|
| 1:37:29| So this is not only a history for Knox County, but it is also of national importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5849)|
| 1:37:38| So I beg you to really protect this area and get more study done about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| before deciding whether it should be resold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5870)|
| 1:37:57| Gerald Thornton is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5877)|
| 1:38:02| Mr. Thornton, if you'll state your name and county of residence, you have three minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| My name is Gerald A. Thornton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| I live at 413 Sugarwood Drive in Farragut, Knox County, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| At the current time, I'm speaking for, as chairperson of the Harvey Broom Group of the Sierra Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| which is a subunit of the National Sierra Club, the nation's largest and oldest conservation organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5903)|
| 1:38:29| I speak tonight to ask you to vote against the request to change the agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| of the core area of the historic Twin Springs Farm in Dry Hollow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| The Sierra Club echoes the comments of the many neighbors of the Twin Springs Farm who are here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| and the comments of Wolf Nagley that you just heard of the Foundation of Global Sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| all who oppose the zoning change for historical and cultural reasons that have just been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5932)|
| 1:38:59| However, we also oppose the zoning change because farmland and woodlands in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5939)|
| 1:39:05| are quickly disappearing under the guise of development, causing considerable environmental destruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| and further contributing to global warming and the degradation of surface waters through erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| and the creation of more hardscape, which creates more stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| Now, we do not dispute the need for more housing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| In fact, we favor more construction of low-cost housing in areas that are more readily accessed by public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5970)|
| 1:39:38| and closer to urban services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| The recent construction of a fully solar-powered, low-cost home by the East Knoxville organization known as SEED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| is a good example of sustainable housing that can be built and that helps protect the environment for the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5988)|
| 1:39:55| The county should also encourage efforts like those of Habitat for Humanity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| which often redevelops lots that previously had houses or commercial buildings that became defunct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| We suggest that the county commission focus on encouraging redevelopment of brownfields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| and abandoned commercial areas or other previously developed areas or higher-density, low-cost housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6012)|
| 1:40:19| instead of allowing more destruction of the greenfields and the farmlands, such as the farmlands and forests in Dry Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6019)|
| 1:40:27| And I want to compliment the commission for a couple of the items tonight were actually good examples of that, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| Items 75 and 76, 77 and 78, which approve rezoning of areas that were previous commercial areas to more dense housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6033)|
| 1:40:46| So it can be done, and we can focus on that instead of on turning our farmlands and forests into more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6046)|
| 1:40:55| So for these reasons, we ask that the commission vote not to change the current zoning of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| at 8802 Sevierville Pike and 0 Dry Hollow Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6060)|

| 1:43:36| because it's consistent with the slope analysis for the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| changes in conditions and trends in development by a vote of 14 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| Thank you, Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| Mr. Forrester, I'd like for you to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| I will defer to Mr. Sanders as representative of the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| May I proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| Again, Taylor Forrester on behalf of the applicant, Thunder Mountain Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| The instant request is for residential housing development in the dry hollow community on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| This is a large tract or tracts of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| We're looking at 159 acres in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| South Knoxville is on the map now for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| There is a huge desire and a demand in South Knoxville for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| I submit that at least half, if not the majority, of the items on the agenda tonight for rezoning were in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6269)|
| 1:44:39| It has been insulated for a number of years from housing, but the demand is now there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| The surrounding area has historically been rural area, but that has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| The change started with a commercial node up at Chapman and John Sevier Highway, and it's continued since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6291)|
| 1:45:01| most notably across Chapman from pretty much this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| In November of last year, there was a use-on-review approved for a sector plan amendment first was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6306)|
| 1:45:15| and approved at medium-density residential and rezoning to planned residential up to 10 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| There was a use-on-review on that in November of last year with that approval as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| Again, there is change in the area, and that change is leading to more housing, more dense housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6327)|
| 1:45:34| which is custom to what this community and all other areas have experienced for the past 20-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6334)|
| 1:45:44| What makes this property ripe for development and in a good position to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6344)|
| 1:45:51| is there's been an expansion of the utilities in this area that's now served by sewer and water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6351)|
| 1:45:58| There has been improvements to the Chapman-Sevierville Pike intersection that provides good ingress and egress to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6358)|
| 1:46:08| There aren't many opportunities remaining in this county that you have such a large track of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| that's served by these infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| Most of these large tracks are still remaining in the further out rural areas that don't have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| or don't have immediate access to utilities, to good roads, to other infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| I submit that when we have these opportunities where these larger tracks come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6390)|
| 1:46:38| and we have infrastructure and we have utilities, we need to take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| I know probably this commission may be sick of hearing about the housing crisis, but the fact is it's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6402)|
| 1:46:47| It's here and we do have to do something about it, especially from an affordability standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| The only way to get affordable housing is to create more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| That is the only way to drive down the prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| We're seeing the increase of the interest rates recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| That's going to be another impact on people trying to afford housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| This area is served with parks, public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6429)|
| 1:47:16| There is general commercial up and down Chapman, immediately adjacent or near this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6436)|
| 1:47:25| Our request, we've got the separate staff analyzing the separate parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6445)|
| 1:47:36| request a second plan amendment on the 95 acres from agricultural to rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6456)|
| 1:47:43| and on the 64 acres from agricultural to low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| and a rezoning to planned residential on the 95 acres at a density of up to 77 total units on the 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6468)|
| 1:47:59| That amounts to .8 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| Then a rezoning to planned residential on the 64 acres with a maximum density of up to 180 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6482)|
| 1:48:09| That amounts to 2.8 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| That is a reasonable density on this site on both the 95 and the 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6494)|
| 1:48:21| 2.8, by and large, as this commission has heard on rezonings of PR time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6501)|
| 1:48:29| 2.8 is one of the lower ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| Tonight, there were multiple discussed at over four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| Again, we believe that this is a responsible, practical, and pragmatic approach to developing this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6517)|
| 1:48:45| This thing is going to have to come through use on review if we're granted the rezoning that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6525)|
| 1:48:53| Further plans are going to have to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| Further plans are going to have to be designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| Those have not been done yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| We are still open to looking at and analyzing what's the best layout for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6542)|
| 1:49:08| not only for the development but also the surrounding area, access, buffers, landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6548)|
| 1:49:15| A deal is only good if it works fair for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| We believe that during that process, parties can come together and things of that nature on the layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| access, buffering, landscaping, can all be discussed and addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6566)|
| 1:49:31| Again, we hope for your support and ask you to approve this for the second plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6571)|
| 1:49:37| and the rezoning with the requested density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| Mr. Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| Daniel Sanders, 900 South Gay Street, Suite 2102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| I am here representing the members of the Dry Hollow community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| Everybody stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6598)|
| 1:50:05| These folks are 100% opposed to this development and the destruction of their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6605)|
| 1:50:13| They want you to maintain the existing plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| They want you to rule in their favor tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| And I'm going to ask you all to go ahead and sit down, and we're going to address some issues tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| Number one, I wanted to thank Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Lundy for allowing us the opportunity to attempt to compromise with this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6628)|
| 1:50:40| Commissioner Daley, at the last meeting where we met, said there should be some fair number that we could reach with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6640)|
| 1:50:51| When we left the meeting, we were hopeful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| We proposed 145 units, which we think would be more compatible with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| The response from the developer was not immediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| We emailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| Eventually they retained counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| We were able to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| I think it was a cold day in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| Commissioner Jay was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| We were told by the developer there is no room to compromise on the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| And so we thank you for the opportunity, but there was no compromise to be had, so we're going to ask you to deny this request tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6682)|
| 1:51:32| Now, rarely have I seen, and I've been around this sort of thing for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6692)|
| 1:51:41| I think I've been set at this table for about 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| Rarely have you seen factual or legal reasons to deny a request be articulated before you so well by a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6705)|
| 1:51:56| And so when I wrote to you in January, I explained how you can rely on that to deny a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6716)|
| 1:52:05| There have been numerous comments articulated to you about reasons to deny this traffic, the sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6725)|
| 1:52:16| and the turning lanes being anticipated before the plan was updated, when we had the last plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6736)|
| 1:52:26| The Knox County Planning Alliance wrote an excellent letter addressing all of the issues about why this proposal is not appropriate under the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6746)|
| 1:52:36| not appropriate under the zoning, not appropriate under the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| So you can rely on all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| But lucky for me, those aren't the legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| Those issues are subject to what I would call legislative opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| You get to decide those issues, right, whether there's been a substantial change, whether there's been a change in policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6774)|
| 1:53:03| whether you want this development to go forward, and more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| whether you want to abide by the existing plans that are in effect right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| Now, this community has said we want to stick with the plan that we've got in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| especially with the process that's currently underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| Advanced Knox is underway right now, and you all probably received this update April 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6800)|
| 1:53:31| What are people saying about what they want to see in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| And I discussed this with Miss Hill almost the day it came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6815)|
| 1:53:44| What do you love about Knox County today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6824)|

| 1:53:51| This is in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| It's got the rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| People want to see that remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| Small town feel, Knoxville and surrounding counties, people, sense of civic pride, friendliness, neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6837)|

| 1:54:11| Maintaining rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| Improving roads and intersections before you approve development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| And that would be to a level that can accommodate the rural development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| not just to fix problems you've got with wrecks that are occurring with the existing traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| And then the last one over here, reading across the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| conserving natural areas and creating more parks and amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| This process is going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| You all cannot be faulted for wanting to stick with the plan that's adopted while this process plays itself out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6881)|
| 1:54:49| and then wait until this process plays out to consider this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| And until then, you can deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| And you can't be sued for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| You're not legally bound to approve this tonight because of anything that's been said by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6900)|
| 1:55:07| You can rely on community opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| And so I want to make one thing very clear to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6910)|
| 1:55:15| If you approve this development tonight, you are saying to this community that you are placing a real estate developer's desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6915)|
| 1:55:25| above the community's desire, above your constituent's desire, and there is no legal basis for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6925)|
| 1:55:35| There is nothing that anybody can do to force you to vote yes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6935)|
| 1:55:44| And I want to make that perfectly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| Now, all those things are basically legislative opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| And these folks out here have elected you to represent their interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6951)|
| 1:55:58| We have some legal issues tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| And these legal issues are present because the way that the developer has chosen to put this in front of the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6962)|
| 1:56:11| and have a recommendation and then bring it to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6971)|
| 1:56:18| I've talked to a lot of you, all right, commissioners that represent a majority of this commission that have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6978)|
| 1:56:28| we believe that 255 units is too much, too much density for this, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6988)|
| 1:56:35| If you approve this at 255 units, you have to assume that all those 255 units are eventually going to be clustered down in that field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=6995)|
| 1:56:44| next to the industrial part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| And I'm going to tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| And I'm going to disagree with the law director's office, and I'm going to disagree with Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7009)|
| 1:56:55| There is nothing in the zoning ordinance or in the subdivision regulations that would prohibit this property owner from getting approval tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7015)|
| 1:57:06| marching down to NPC, submitting a subdivision concept plan for 255 units on the field, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7026)|
| 1:57:15| And if the law director's office and the planning commission are going to take a contrary position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| I think it's incumbent on this commission to ask what parts of the ordinance or parts of the subdivision regulations dictate that result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7041)|
| 1:57:30| I don't know of anything in any of the ordinances or any of the subdivision regulations that would prohibit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| If you don't want 255 units on the field, you need to reduce the number of units to a total number of acceptable units that you want to see down there on the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7056)|
| 1:57:46| or, as I have suggested, send this thing back to planning commission for a recommendation on individual parcels that aren't combined in the same request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7066)|
| 1:58:00| Now, two legal issues at play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| One, you cannot impose conditions on rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7083)|
| 1:58:10| I know that you may have a practice of doing that, but that practice does not make it legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7090)|
| 1:58:16| And I have cited the cases in my – or cited the statutes in my letter to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7096)|
| 1:58:22| I know that the property owner has cited a case from 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| I don't think it stands for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| But I think if you impose conditions on this rezoning that would limit development in one area or another, you do so at your own peril.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7108)|
| 1:58:37| I think that maybe those conditions would be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| Now, given that most of you think 255 units is too many units to have in the field, like I say, I think you're left with two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7120)|
| 1:58:53| I think either you limit the total number of units to 180 down from 255, or you send this thing back to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7133)|
| 1:59:03| Now, that's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| And I think I've interpreted these statutes for over a decade now, and I am – that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7146)|
| 1:59:18| So if, as most of you say, you don't want 255 units down there in the field and that's too many, you've got some negotiating to do amongst yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7158)|
| 1:59:33| Now, whatever might be said about the legal issues, I would conclude by saying you have a community out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7173)|
| 1:59:44| They're showing up at a meeting in the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| They have over 600 signatures on a petition that opposed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7187)|
| 1:59:53| Six hundred people is almost – I would say the number of people that live within almost two miles of this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7193)|
| 2:00:00| And you're going to put the potential for another 600 individuals in this 64 acres alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7200)|
| 2:00:10| It's contrary to the planning documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| It's contrary to the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| It's contrary to the purpose of separating industrial uses from residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7214)|
| 2:00:21| And there are plenty of reasons to deny this, and we ask you to deny it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7221)|
| 2:00:29| Thank you, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7229)|
| 2:00:38| Applicant will have an opportunity to respond, but I want to open things up to the commissioners for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7238)|
| 2:00:46| I've seen some of you taking notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| If any of you have any questions, either for Mr. Sanders or Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7249)|
| 2:00:59| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| Mr. Sanders, you can come up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7262)|
| 2:01:08| When you say imposing conditions could potentially be a legality issue, what conditions are you speaking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7268)|
| 2:01:19| Right, so in speaking to you all and reviewing the video from last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| I sort of tried to read the tea leaves and see how Commissioner Daley might want to limit density to 180 dwelling units on the field, the 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7285)|
| 2:01:35| Well, that seems to me like a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| So you can either do that, you have a practice of doing that through a maximum density limitation for the entire request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7298)|
| 2:01:48| or you might consider saying, hey, and I think this is where Commissioner Daley was going, no more than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7308)|
| 2:01:57| and I think you said it at the meeting, no more than 180 units on the low part, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7317)|
| 2:02:06| There are statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| Your zoning authority is governed by statutes 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| You derive your authority from the legislature through the statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7332)|
| 2:02:17| Your general authority, 13-7-101, says nothing about conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7337)|
| 2:02:24| And conditional zoning, contract zoning, both of those things, there are definitions for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7344)|
| 2:02:29| Neither one of those things are contained in your general authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| But if you read on down in the general authority that the county has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| there's specific authority given to Hamilton County for contract zoning and conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7356)|
| 2:02:46| None of those things are authorized for Knox County, where the legislature specifically authorizes one county to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7366)|
| 2:02:55| and withholds that authority from the general power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7375)|
| 2:02:59| The general power doesn't contain those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| So Hamilton County, Blount County, have the authority to impose conditions on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| The rest of the counties do not, and that's in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| They're in black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| So you can't impose conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| So if you want less density down in the field, you really need to send this back to planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7396)|
| 2:03:25| to make a recommendation on the 64 acres alone and leave this 95 acres of agricultural land agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7405)|
| 2:03:35| Otherwise, if you approve this at 255 units tonight, the developer is going to submit a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7415)|
| 2:03:45| The concept plan could combine these two parcels, and you get 255 units that you can put anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7425)|
| 2:03:53| And that's how it works, and I would challenge anybody to point to a part of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| or part of the subdivision regulations that prohibits that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| We're going to be concerned about property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| I must have missed it for the past 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7445)|
| 2:04:09| Now, to that point, we know that the developer has intended to develop this 64 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7449)|
| 2:04:18| at above three dwelling units per acre the entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7458)|
| 2:04:24| I can reference the planning staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7464)|
| 2:04:34| The application was originally scheduled for November the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| The planning commission meeting with an original acreage of approximately 64 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7479)|
| 2:04:47| with a request to rezone to PR at up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| That's what the developer wanted to do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| I assume because the law director's office corrected its position and the executive office corrected its position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7495)|
| 2:05:00| on the growth plan that four dwelling units in the rural area was not going to be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| So here we come with the 95 acres, and we're going to use the PR zone to cluster dwelling units down on the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7505)|
| 2:05:13| And so before the November 10th meeting, they revised their application, deferred to December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7513)|
| 2:05:22| And on November the 5th, they revised their application to include 95 acres of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7522)|
| 2:05:29| a total of 158 acres to be rezoned at PR up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7529)|
| 2:05:35| Now, if you're limited to three dwelling units per acre in the rural area in the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7535)|
| 2:05:46| the first application could have been submitted for 64 acres and three dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| That would be 195 or 192 units if I'm doing the math correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7551)|
| 2:05:57| Why add the 95 acres to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| Well, it's because they want to cluster more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| They wanted four dwelling units per acre on the 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| They weren't able to get it under the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| They revised their application so that they could cluster 77 more units down here on the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7569)|
| 2:06:17| And I'll say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| I don't think that there's anything in the subdivision regulations or the zoning ordinance that would require a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7578)|
| 2:06:23| to go back through a rezoning process when he's already got PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7583)|
| 2:06:30| Go back through the process before he submits a subdivision application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| And I stand to be corrected, but I don't think that you can point to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7594)|
| 2:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7603)|
| 2:06:50| I still have a question about condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7610)|
| 2:06:53| So if as opposed to doing limiting the total units of housing, what's the difference between saying there can only be 180 max units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7613)|
| 2:07:07| on this flat 64 acres versus what that equals to in dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7627)|
| 2:07:14| Well, there may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| There may not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| There may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| In fact, in the PR zone, it reserves the planning commission the authority to determine density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7640)|
| 2:07:33| And so if you guys think that there is a problem here with clustering, like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| I think this needs to go back to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| and you shouldn't be dealing with such a large request all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7661)|
| 2:07:47| If you want to take this in piecemeal and not have 255 units dumped on this community right now, right now is your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7667)|
| 2:07:56| You get to approve this or deny it today, or you can send it back to planning commission with instruction to make some other request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7676)|
| 2:08:04| And I'll tell you, I don't often put in letters the way that my adversaries can do something that I can't appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7684)|
| 2:08:15| but I really think the planning commission needs to have another look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| and it needs to be pared down into one parcel and not such a big parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7698)|
| 2:08:26| because if you get this, if you approve this tonight, you're going to have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7706)|
| 2:08:30| You're going to have 255 units on a field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| To your point, I don't think there's – there may not be a difference in that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7715)|
| 2:08:41| Mr. Forrester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7721)|
| 2:08:46| To speak to what is being referenced as clustering, can you speak to that for me, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7726)|
| 2:08:51| with the 95 additional acres that were added after the original application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7731)|
| 2:08:57| What was the purpose of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| Is it for this clustering, as Mr. Sanders is presenting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7739)|
| 2:09:03| I wouldn't say it's for the clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| I would say it's in response to the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| where you could have up to a density of three units per acre under the growth policy plan in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7750)|
| 2:09:18| and then bring it into the 95 acres, because Mr. Sanders wants to represent that's all hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7758)|
| 2:09:23| It's not all hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| There is developable property in non-hillside things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| As far as the conditions, we submit that you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| We conditioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| One of my approvals earlier had four conditions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| I would call on Mr. Moyers with the law director's office to maybe get his opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7779)|
| 2:09:49| I would love your opinion, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7789)|
| 2:09:52| Well, I heard a lot about resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| I started doing this in 1988, so I've been doing this for about 35 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7796)|
| 2:10:03| Back in 1988, and as far as I know, without ceasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| this county commission has placed conditions on properties that it has rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7808)|
| 2:10:15| I appreciate Mr. Sanders' opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| Is this not on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| I hate these buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| I have to sit way over here next to Commissioner Briggs to keep my bigs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| Man, I did it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| In any event, there's a whole series of cases in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7829)|
| 2:10:35| that speak to the difference between conditional zoning and contract zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7835)|
| 2:10:41| Conditional zoning is, as the courts say, an exercise of the legislative power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7841)|
| 2:10:48| Contract zoning, by contrast, is where the county basically gives away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| or contracts away its rights and duties to zone in the public interest in exchange for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7853)|
| 2:11:04| Contract zoning is not legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| And the statutes that Mr. Sanders has referred to in Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| what they say is that Hamilton County can do conditional and contract zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7872)|
| 2:11:18| and that's the thing that's important because, according to our cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| conditional zoning is just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| It's contract zoning that's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| And so for some reason that I cannot fathom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| the legislature thought it was important to give Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| and the city of Chattanooga the right to do contract zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| which we, I would agree, could not do, can do conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| Always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| You've done it probably a couple of dozen times this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| And so respectfully, because I do respect him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7905)|
| 2:11:49| I just think that Mr. Sanders is incorrect about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7909)|
| 2:11:52| Now, I would say that the county commission and all county legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7912)|
| 2:11:57| are given wide discretion when it comes to rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| And the courts give the legislative bodies a great deal of deference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7922)|
| 2:12:09| in the decisions that they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| So as long as the county is acting in the interest of the health and welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| of the citizens of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| I believe you can put whatever conditions you wish on this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7937)|
| 2:12:23| and I believe the MPC will be obliged to respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7946)|
| 2:12:29| Thank you, Mr. Moriarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| That's all I have for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| Thank you, Commissioner Durant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| I was going to ask that same question to Chancellor Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7962)|
| 2:12:46| Law Director Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7973)|
| 2:12:58| We have put conditions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| We've put conditions before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| I don't see any difference from putting a condition on limiting the 64 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7985)|
| 2:13:11| and limiting the ridge stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| We as a legislative body can do that, and you have confirmed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=7996)|
| 2:13:24| My plan was, Mr. Sanders was correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| my plan was to limit it at 180 there on the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| and it will probably be that same thing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| and we'll limit that 180 on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| And I don't see anything wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| Daniel says that use the plan in process in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| Well, the plan in process in place is rule up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8026)|
| 2:13:50| That is the plan in process, rule up to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| 180 is 2.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| That's below the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| I don't understand why there's a big issue when they're following,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8039)|
| 2:14:06| when a property owner is following the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| The growth plan says rule up to three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8050)|
| 2:14:15| The sector plan, which is 10 years old, says rule up to three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8055)|
| 2:14:22| And that's what they're not asking for 4, 5, 5.5 or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8062)|
| 2:14:27| It's been advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| The property owner is only asking for 2.8 is what they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8070)|
| 2:14:35| And that's following this plan right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| It's following the plan that is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| The statement was made that our schools are overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8081)|

| 2:15:03| I would love to see a new elementary school around New Hopewell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8103)|
| 2:15:07| that can concentrate more kids in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| Daniel said something about, and I did, I'm pretty sure I said, a fair number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8112)|
| 2:15:22| 180 to me is a fair number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8122)|

| 2:15:30| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8130)|
| 2:15:32| Because once they really go back and do the engineering work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8132)|
| 2:15:36| Mr. Snowden and his team, retention ponds and roads, it's not going to be 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8136)|
| 2:15:45| I don't think it will be 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| 180, like I say, is 2.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| If we go with the planning recommendation, it's 192, not 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| So that is a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| Again, the planning process goes back to use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8162)|
| 2:16:08| Citizens have the ability to go and sit in on the use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8168)|
| 2:16:15| and say, hey, yes, we like this or we don't like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| That's use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| That's something that they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| Yes, there's a planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| It's called the sector plan and the growth plan rule up to three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8185)|
| 2:16:31| I have never been in favor of clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| No matter what was written out there or what was said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| I was never, ever going to let 255 units be put on that bottom lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8199)|
| 2:16:48| It wasn't going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| I didn't get a chance back in January to finish what I was going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8210)|
| 2:16:56| about limiting it to 190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| Yes, I feel like this commission, we are a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8219)|
| 2:17:05| If I make the motion to limit to 180 and it is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| it can go no more than 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| It doesn't have to be 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| It could be 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| It could be 160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| But I guarantee you that if we pass it at 180,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| it ain't going to pass more than 181.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| It could only be 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| And there will be no clustering whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| I'll turn my mic off and let someone else follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8255)|
| 2:17:42| I'll make a motion later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8267)|
| 2:17:52| Mr. Moyers, is it your opinion that the wording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8272)|
| 2:18:04| approve PR zoning up to 2.5 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8284)|
| 2:18:11| for approximately 64 acres of parcel X and a portion of Y| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8291)|
| 2:18:19| on the east side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| comma, approve PR plan residential zoning up to 1.0 dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8302)|
| 2:18:32| for approximately 95 acres is a condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8312)|
| 2:18:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| The density is a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| The different densities and the different parts of the property are a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| These are the kinds of things that this body is competent to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| So if this body considers approving the recommendation of the Planning Commission at 2.5 on the 64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8336)|
| 2:19:06| and one on the 95, if my math is correct, and it might not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8346)|
| 2:19:16| that's a total of, what did I say, 255 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| However, only 160 of those units can be on the bottom area that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8361)|
| 2:19:34| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8374)|
| 2:19:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8375)|
| 2:19:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8377)|
| 2:19:38| So if we approve it as written, then the maximum would be the 255.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8378)|
| 2:19:46| And I know, just like we all know, that you're not going to be able to get a unit per acre on that 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8386)|
| 2:19:55| I mean, all I have to do is look at it and know that that's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| So that was my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| The second thing is I see statements like responsible development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8403)|
| 2:20:15| and talking about overruling, you know, the will of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8415)|
| 2:20:26| I will tell you, with the things that have gone on in Knox County this last ten years from one end to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8426)|
| 2:20:34| if you asked every community member in Knox County if they were happy about what was happening next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8434)|
| 2:20:41| we'd probably have about a 2 percent satisfaction rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8441)|
| 2:20:48| But I don't say that necessarily to indicate that because your community doesn't like it or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8448)|
| 2:21:02| and you all know where I live, many of my communities don't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8462)|
| 2:21:08| That is not to say that for responsible development that this commission is charged with taking care of the growth that's occurring in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8468)|
| 2:21:23| and providing housing, especially more affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8483)|
| 2:21:28| I mean, this is what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8488)|
| 2:21:31| Had we followed what every community wanted, we would still be sitting back at half the population we've got now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8491)|
| 2:21:41| because there wouldn't be any place for anybody to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8501)|
| 2:21:44| In a perfect world, that would be wonderful maybe, but it is not 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8504)|
| 2:21:51| It's just not, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| Well, when I bought my land, it wasn't because there was $200,000 to drive houses down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8514)|
| 2:22:00| Sir, sorry, but you're out of order. Commissioner Hill, continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| I'm leaving. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8525)|
| 2:22:11| Where you all live is beautiful. I mean, it's jaw-dropping gorgeous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8531)|
| 2:22:21| Fortunately or fortunately, we have got places all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| Something's got to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| Now, you all are stating you're not against some development, that you, you know, you have a number fixed in your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8549)|
| 2:22:37| I would just like to suggest that this 146, is that what you said, Mr. Sanders, that the community was willing to accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8557)|
| 2:22:50| I think so. We wrote a letter in January that said 145 units, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| and I think the rough math on that works out to about two, a little bit less than two and a half on the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8575)|
| 2:23:03| But you do get to cluster in the PR zone, and that's what you've got to be concerned about if you approve 158 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8583)|
| 2:23:18| All right. I'll get back to that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| What I'm getting to is the total number that you, I heard you say that the community would accept your 146.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8601)|
| 2:23:33| And we're talking about a total of how many acres? 159 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8613)|
| 2:23:45| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| 159 acres total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| Okay. At this 146 that you're saying you're willing to accept, that's not even one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8630)|
| 2:24:00| You can't build on all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| Well, that, listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| Of course you can't build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| I know you can't. I know you can't. I know you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| I hope you all that have sat here and listened to all the approvals that we did before now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8650)|
| 2:24:19| that you will see whatever this outcome is, whether it goes back to planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8659)|
| 2:24:24| whether what's on the table was passed, that what is going on is not unique or any different than what the rest of our county is dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8664)|
| 2:24:41| You've heard up to five per acre approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| I promise you the people next door to that probably aren't tickled about it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8684)|
| 2:24:50| It is the result of living in a growing, prosperous county where housing has got to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8690)|
| 2:25:03| Make no mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| I'm not crazy about the way it's all happening either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8705)|
| 2:25:08| I am encouraged about some of the progress we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| I cannot speak to this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| I've never laid eyes on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| I don't know about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| I can speak to some of the progress we are slowly making with many of our other developers that have become much more open to listening and a lot more give and take there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8718)|
| 2:25:31| It sounds like you were sort of on the start with this, both sides, but you just reached the point of no return, and sometimes that happens too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8731)|
| 2:25:42| At any rate, I sell that to say that whatever happens here, it is a result of what happens when you live in a county like Knox County that is growing and thriving and developing and building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8742)|
| 2:26:08| Like it or not, this is kind of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8768)|
| 2:26:12| And as a commission, it's very painful too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| Nobody really is crazy about making other people unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8776)|
| 2:26:21| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| I want to remind my fellow commissioners that at the moment we are considering the sector plan amendment, not the rezoning and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8783)|
| 2:26:30| This is good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| However, we've kind of drifted from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| I just want to remind us that that's what we're considering is item 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8795)|
| 2:26:39| So I believe next is Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| Thank you, Chairman Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=8802)|

| 2:37:40| Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. Commissioner Schoonmaker and then Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9460)|
| 2:37:44| Thank you, Chairman Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9464)|
| 2:37:50| Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9470)|
| 2:37:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| The staff recommendation for the rezoning was 3 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| The planning commissioners reduced that to 2.5 dwelling units per acre on the 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9481)|
| 2:38:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9489)|
| 2:38:10| Okay, so based on what we have here, the planning commissioner said you could put 160 units on that, what do you call it, the flatlands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9490)|
| 2:38:26| Flatlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| Flatlands. And then you're able to do 95 units in the other portion. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9507)|
| 2:38:33| Are you saying, was that the planning commissioner's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| It was, but then they had the clustering condition, which we're not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9517)|
| 2:38:42| Okay, all right. So what I'm trying to figure out is, how do we go from 160 to where Commissioner Daley's doing 180?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9522)|
| 2:38:52| So to not do the clustering, the 2.8 would allow the 180 and the lower 64, the flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9532)|
| 2:39:00| And then, whereas planning commission suggested 95 units on the 95 acres, which has a lot more hillside, our request would be to do 77 on that 95, therefore 0.8 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9540)|
| 2:39:15| Okay, so 80 and 77. 180 and 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9555)|
| 2:39:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9559)|
| 2:39:20| Okay, all right. So would you agree on the 64 acres to do 180 dwelling units in a Phase 1 project and not do any additional units on those 64 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9560)|
| 2:39:49| until all those units are, let's just say, all the lots are divided, and then which time you could go to Phase 2 and develop the 77 acres on the hillside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9589)|
| 2:40:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| You could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9606)|
| 2:40:07| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| So we could put a condition that if we voted tonight on the rezoning, that you'd still get, you would get 180 for the 64 acres, and then with no construction on the hillside of the 77 units until all 180 units are platted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9609)|
| 2:40:29| Correct, yes. We could go through the USUN review but not pull permitting for Phase 77, 77 units until the 180 was completed. Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9629)|
| 2:40:38| So that eliminates the clustering of 77 units down on the 64 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| It would. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| All right. Does everybody understand what I'm proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| No? Okay, I'll repeat it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9650)|
| 2:40:52| On the 64 acres that you call the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9652)|
| 2:40:55| Lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9655)|
| 2:40:56| The lower area, they could do 180 homesites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| Up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9662)|
| 2:41:03| Up to, 180 homesites, not a single one over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9663)|
| 2:41:09| They could not do any construction on the hillside portion, which would be the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9669)|
| 2:41:15| Upper side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| Upper side. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9676)|
| 2:41:18| Upper and lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| Of the 77 units until all 180 units are platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| So that way you don't have a problem with clustering of units all on one 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9683)|
| 2:41:30| Does everybody understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| I see a lot of shaking heads. Okay, so that's agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9694)|
| 2:41:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| That's what I wanted to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9705)|
| 2:41:52| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9712)|
| 2:41:54| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| I want to put this out here about development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9717)|
| 2:42:01| We try to get the most and best use out of all of our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9721)|
| 2:42:04| and that's one reason is to make sure we have affordable housing for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9724)|
| 2:42:09| You all live in houses now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| There's people that are trying to move in houses that can't afford it because the supply is down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9731)|
| 2:42:16| and so when you have the supply down and demand's up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| that means it's a lot more expensive than it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| And some of these younger people that are coming out of our community here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9742)|
| 2:42:27| looking for jobs and looking for ways of buying houses and staying in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9747)|
| 2:42:31| but a lot of them are moving out to younger people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9751)|
| 2:42:35| who are looking for some advantages in the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9755)|
| 2:42:42| We're right in the middle of a rock and a hard place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9762)|
| 2:42:47| If we do what you want to do, we're limiting supply, which makes the cost go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9767)|
| 2:42:53| If we do what the developer wants, makes the supply go up, makes the cost should come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9773)|
| 2:43:00| So we've got to get some way to where we can make both of them equal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| so we can help our community still grow and still not be overburdened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9783)|
| 2:43:11| So take a look at it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9791)|
| 2:43:14| I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9794)|
| 2:43:15| All those houses are not going to be built at one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| Three years ago, we approved a place out in my area for 83 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| which would do 315 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| That's three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| Right now, there's 175 houses on that property, so it's not been built out in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9806)|
| 2:43:32| So it's not just going to go, boom, it's all going to be there at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9812)|
| 2:43:38| And you kind of grow into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| It does help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9821)|
| 2:43:42| We've brought a lot of new people into our area that enjoy our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9822)|
| 2:43:49| that we've enjoyed so much without having been there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9829)|
| 2:43:54| And I've made new friends that I would never have seen before by not letting those people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9834)|
| 2:44:01| So you can be kind of that, like, I've got what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9841)|
| 2:44:05| I don't want anybody else to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| And I think what we need to do is see what we can do to share a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9848)|

| 2:44:18| instead of being saying, hey, I've got mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| I don't want you to get any of mine either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| But if you look at this development, hey, listen, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9865)|
| 2:44:35| Gary, please be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| He isn't talking to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9877)|
| 2:44:41| And the thing of it is everybody is thinking all that house is going to be there at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9881)|
| 2:44:48| It's not going to be there at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9888)|
| 2:44:51| And your community will go around the development that is being coming up out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9891)|
| 2:44:55| Other things will come in that area too and make your area even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9895)|
| 2:45:00| And that's what happens in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| Sometimes you make a hard choice, and the people in my district didn't like me for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9905)|
| 2:45:11| but now they see it's better for them for what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9911)|
| 2:45:16| So I wish we could just think about what can we do to do the best we can with what we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9916)|
| 2:45:24| and make sure we draw business in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9924)|
| 2:45:26| If we don't have housing, then our business market will not grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9926)|
| 2:45:31| and our young people will leave this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9931)|
| 2:45:35| So I just want to let you know that I know what I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9935)|
| 2:45:41| I would like a compromise, and that's what we're trying to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| And so whatever the commissioner in the district decides, I'm going to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9944)|
| 2:45:50| So that's my feeling right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9950)|
| 2:45:54| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| Ms. Brooks, in the caption on Item 90, it says subject to one condition by a vote of 10-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9958)|
| 2:46:07| I just reviewed the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| I can't seem to find the one condition that it refers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| Do you know what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9973)|
| 2:46:14| Yes, it's subject to allowing for all the density to be clustered on that lower portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9974)|
| 2:46:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9981)|
| 2:46:23| So if you all do not want that to happen, you need to strike that condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9983)|
| 2:46:29| or not include it in your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| Okay, so that can be removed from the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| And it would not have the availability to cluster there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9996)|
| 2:46:37| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=9997)|
| 2:46:40| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| Do you want me to restate what I restated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| This is what I would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10007)|
| 2:46:49| John, I understand what you're saying, so I'd like you to make the motion and I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| But in your motion, make sure that I've had it written up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10014)|
| 2:47:00| Removing condition number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| Make sure that condition is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10024)|
| 2:47:07| There will be no clustering whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10030)|
| 2:47:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| Mr. Chairman, am I recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10033)|
| 2:47:15| Oh, we do have two by its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| You're welcome to go ahead and make your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| Yeah, I can make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| Okay, you can offer a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| My motion is to, on the 64 acres, which is classified as the flat land, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10047)|
| 2:47:39| The 64 acres, that a density of up to 180 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10059)|
| 2:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10067)|
| 2:47:49| On the 95 acres, with a maximum density of 77 units, with two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10069)|
| 2:48:00| One condition is that the 180 units must be platted first before the 77 units are platted, so that there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10080)|
| 2:48:14| Platted? Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10094)|
| 2:48:20| Mr. Forrester, platted or completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10100)|
| 2:48:26| Mr. Snowden, how do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| I'm not sure the actual administrator, but we're talking about the 180 units on the 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10109)|
| 2:48:36| How do we want to do it so that you cannot build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| That would be phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| Phase two could not be built until phase one is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10121)|
| 2:48:44| I think Mr. Snowden has an idea of how that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| Yeah, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| I mean, that's something that we've done in the past as far as timing of transportation improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| So that's something that's accustomed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| Okay, so we've got 180 units on the 64 acres, and that would be phase one, and the 77 units are phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10138)|
| 2:49:08| There will be no clustering of the total units on the 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10148)|
| 2:49:18| And we've removed the condition from NOx planning about clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10158)|
| 2:49:27| And otherwise, that includes approving the rezoning as recommended by the Planning Commission, minus the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10167)|
| 2:49:34| No, because we're actually increasing the density a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10174)|
| 2:49:37| We're doing 180 instead of 160, and 77 instead of 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10177)|
| 2:49:43| I'm just making sure you're including the zoning change itself in your motion, because it's not just density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10183)|
| 2:49:49| What questions do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| Commissioner Daley has seconded the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| So the motion by Commissioner Schoonmaker is to approve the rezoning as stated with the density of no more than 180 units on the 64 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10197)|
| 2:50:10| which is phase one, and no more than 77 units on the 95 acres, which is phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10210)|
| 2:50:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10221)|
| 2:50:22| Removing the condition imposed by the Planning Commission that involved clustering of the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10222)|
| 2:50:28| and nothing can be built on the 95 acres until the 180 units on the 64 acres is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10228)|
| 2:50:39| That is the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10239)|
| 2:50:40| Is that agreeable to the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10240)|
| 2:50:43| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10243)|
| 2:50:44| Can we just define completed, like COs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| We asked that question of Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10248)|
| 2:50:53| Can we define completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| Are we saying COs for every single house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| I think what we were talking about was created lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10257)|
| 2:51:00| So it wouldn't be the COs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| COs are a little harder for us to track, so platted lots are a little bit cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10262)|
| 2:51:07| That's hard to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10267)|
| 2:51:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10268)|
| 2:51:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10271)|
| 2:51:12| Commissioner Durant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10272)|
| 2:51:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10275)|
| 2:51:16| I have a question about the flat area because I'm looking at the South County Sector Plan amendment map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10276)|
| 2:51:25| and parcel 270 I think is what we are referencing as 64 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10285)|
| 2:51:31| and then there's parcel 274, which includes what looks to be a portion of the flat, the lower part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10291)|
| 2:51:39| but it also includes the other hillside portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10299)|
| 2:51:44| So are we leaving that smaller 274 parcel flat area alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10304)|
| 2:51:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| The condition is not being imposed on the parcels separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10314)|
| 2:51:58| It's being imposed on the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| Is that correct, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| Because the parcels, there's some overlap, am I correct, on the acreage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10323)|
| 2:52:08| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| Let me look at that a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10330)|
| 2:52:13| Because if we're looking at the agenda, it says approve PR zoning for up to two and a half units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10333)|
| 2:52:28| for approximately 64 acres of parcel 138-270 and then a portion of parcel 274.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10348)|
| 2:52:35| So is that the assumption that that is the flat portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10355)|
| 2:52:40| Yes, because it's 64 acres of both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10360)|
| 2:52:44| 64 acres of parcel 138 and a portion of parcel 274.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10364)|
| 2:52:47| The flat portion only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10369)|
| 2:52:50| And the non-flat is what's left, which is 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10370)|
| 2:52:53| That's the way I understood it as I looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10373)|
| 2:52:55| I just wanted to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10380)|
| 2:53:02| I want to go back to what you mean by completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10382)|
| 2:53:06| Does that mean the flat, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10386)|
| 2:53:11| Flatted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10391)|
| 2:53:13| So it's flatted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10393)|
| 2:53:14| So when you move forward, if he's doing it in sections like A, B, C, D sections, does he have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10394)|
| 2:53:22| He can't do anything on the balance, on the seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10402)|
| 2:53:24| He can do anything below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| He can't do anything on the 95 acres until phase one is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10406)|
| 2:53:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10410)|
| 2:53:31| It doesn't limit him from going and to keep on developing his plots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10411)|
| 2:53:36| He doesn't have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10416)|
| 2:53:37| No restriction because he's got 64 acres to work with, and he can put up to 180 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10417)|
| 2:53:42| So phasing doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10422)|
| 2:53:44| He has four phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10424)|
| 2:53:45| He can work in phase four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| He can do 10 phases, 10 years, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10429)|
| 2:53:50| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10432)|
| 2:53:53| I know we didn't get to hear from Daniel on the second part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| Do you have anything to say about the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10435)|
| 2:54:02| I would reiterate that the county commission, your authority to impose these conditions is not found anywhere in the statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10442)|
| 2:54:23| And I know that there are some cases out there that talk about conditional zoning, but I haven't found any that aren't in Chattanooga or Hamilton County that talk about conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10463)|
| 2:54:38| There's a way to do this, but the way to do it is to send it back to planning commission for recommendations on individual parcels or a resubdivision of individual parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10478)|
| 2:54:54| You're going to take this as one request and impose conditions with I don't know what authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10494)|
| 2:55:04| It's not in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10504)|
| 2:55:07| Cases from Hamilton County, whereas you could send it back to planning commission and do exactly what you're trying to do now without imposing any conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10507)|
| 2:55:17| It goes back to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| Planning commission makes a recommendation on the 64 acres at a certain density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10519)|
| 2:55:26| It comes back up to you without the 95 acres attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10526)|
| 2:55:31| You let the 64 acres develop as you've sort of negotiated here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10531)|
| 2:55:39| Don't rezone or do a sector plan amendment for the 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10539)|
| 2:55:45| And that's how you get to this solution that you've arrived at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10545)|
| 2:55:51| You're not going to be able to really determine whether your motion is a legal motion until you make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10551)|
| 2:56:01| But I don't think that you have the authority to put conditions on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10561)|
| 2:56:08| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10568)|
| 2:56:11| You're next. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10571)|
| 2:56:14| Now, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10574)|
| 2:56:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10579)|
| 2:56:24| Are you stating then that a planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10584)|
| 2:56:30| And their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10590)|
| 2:56:35| You're you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10595)|
| 2:56:36| I think I hear you saying that since you don't believe conditions are appropriate or illegal that that we cannot remove the one that they stated about the clustering, which is something your people are adamantly against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10596)|
| 2:56:59| Well, not anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| I'm just saying you better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| You better watch what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| You don't have authority to impose them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10627)|
| 2:57:08| I don't know that we're I think we may be talking past one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| I think there is an issue with the condition that planning commission impose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10631)|
| 2:57:16| I spoke with Miss Brooks earlier and apparently Miss Brooks in the law department and Mr. Commissioner Daly got together and decided that once you have PR zoning imposed upon different parcels, that those parcels cannot then be resubdivided together and use the density off of both of them and cluster them where you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10636)|
| 2:57:41| But I didn't hear I didn't hear anybody at planning commission when that particular condition was imposed by planning commission saying that that condition was illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10661)|
| 2:57:49| But but but you did hear the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| And it contained conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| And the condition was that that clustering could not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10676)|
| 2:58:03| That which I think is what I'm hearing that you have at your group has asked for from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10683)|
| 2:58:10| Well, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| You can you can air in in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10692)|
| 2:58:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10696)|
| 2:58:18| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10698)|
| 2:58:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10699)|
| 2:58:20| My group, my clients don't want 180 units on the 64 acre what we're calling the flat area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10700)|
| 2:58:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| So, I mean, the question then becomes, would this commission have passed this rezoning if it had not imposed that condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10711)|
| 2:58:41| Well, that that raises a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10721)|
| 2:58:45| I'm hearing that the motion on the floor protects the and perhaps you did say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10725)|
| 2:58:53| But I have heard some in the group saying that they don't want them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10733)|
| 2:59:00| They don't want 250 homes all bundled basically on that lower section, which I understand initially was one of your greatest concerns that you didn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10740)|
| 2:59:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10752)|
| 2:59:13| Awful mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10753)|
| 2:59:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10754)|
| 2:59:15| And that would be a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10755)|
| 2:59:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10756)|
| 2:59:17| And we've you and I have talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10757)|
| 2:59:19| You think that to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10761)|
| 2:59:22| And clearly the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| I don't know that it will pass, but it probably I don't know that it would pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10764)|
| 2:59:30| But I haven't heard a lot of opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10770)|
| 2:59:35| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10775)|
| 2:59:36| Let me just if I can muddy the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10776)|
| 2:59:40| I would like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10780)|
| 2:59:45| That is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10785)|
| 2:59:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10786)|
| 2:59:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10787)|
| 2:59:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10788)|
| 2:59:52| Get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| That we approve planned residential zoning up to two point five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10795)|
| 3:00:10| or approximately 64 acres in the aforementioned parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10810)|
| 3:00:21| As a side note, that's 160 on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10821)|
| 3:00:25| Not 180.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10825)|
| 3:00:26| It's 160 on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10826)|
| 3:00:31| And that we approve zoning of one per dwelling unit on the approximately 95 acres in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10831)|
| 3:00:48| upper portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10848)|
| 3:00:53| That would make a potential of 255 both together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10853)|
| 3:01:00| However, we know you guys know they can't get one per acre on that 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10860)|
| 3:01:07| So I'm again trying to get to some more compromise here where the developer can still do a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10867)|
| 3:01:18| size development on the lower part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| We'll have a little bit more protection on the upper part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10881)|
| 3:01:24| Anyway, that and the condition of clustering is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10884)|
| 3:01:37| Removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10897)|
| 3:01:38| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10898)|
| 3:01:39| Did you want to do the phasing as Commissioner Schoonmaker suggested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10901)|
| 3:01:42| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10902)|
| 3:01:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10903)|
| 3:01:44| There's no utilities on that upper part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| They're not going to be in any hurry to do that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10906)|
| 3:01:48| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10908)|
| 3:01:50| So your motion Commissioner Hill is to approve the rezoning to PR plan residential at a density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10910)|
| 3:01:56| of up to 2.5 dwelling units per acre for the approximately 64 acres and a density of up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10916)|
| 3:02:02| to one unit per acre for the approximately 95 acres with the removal of the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10922)|
| 3:02:07| that allows for the development density to be clustered on the 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10927)|
| 3:02:16| 95 acres on the upper portion at one per acre and 64 acres at 2.5 in the lower portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10936)|
| 3:02:24| Is there a second to the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10944)|
| 3:02:32| I have a second by Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| We have more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| I want to call on Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10957)|
| 3:02:40| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10960)|
| 3:02:42| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10962)|
| 3:02:43| If you call for the question, you're calling for the question on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10963)|
| 3:02:48| Commissioner Daley has called for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10968)|
| 3:02:50| So, Madam Clerk, please call the roll beginning at wherever we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=10970)|

| 3:05:26| We're back to the original motion, which was about Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11126)|
| 3:05:30| Commissioner Jay, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11130)|
| 3:05:33| You're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11133)|
| 3:05:34| I still have a question related to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11134)|
| 3:05:37| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| Mr. Snowden, can you explain platting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11139)|
| 3:05:42| Can you explain what it takes for your department to issue a plat that then can be sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11142)|
| 3:05:51| Yeah, there are several conditions on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| There has to be certifications that utilities are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11155)|
| 3:06:00| There's a surety posted for them to be there, as well as the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11160)|
| 3:06:04| So, essentially, if the developer walked away from everything, those lots could be accessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11164)|
| 3:06:09| So, we have sureties in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| Oftentimes, the facilities are built and then platted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11171)|
| 3:06:14| So, that's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| Planning's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11176)|
| 3:06:18| So, it is a joint venture that we work together to make sure those lots are in compliance with the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-zoning?start=11178)|
