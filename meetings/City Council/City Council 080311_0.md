| 0:00:00| Good evening. I'd like to call to order the council meeting of March 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| And thank you all for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=6)|
| 0:00:08| Before we ask the invocation, which Ms. Pilo will give, and then the pledge to be led by Mr. Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=8)|
| 0:00:16| we had one little piece of bad news that I'll mention so that Ms. Pilo can make her invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=16)|
| 0:00:20| One of our public service workers, Roy Chase, who was fixing a pothole today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=20)|
| 0:00:26| and an out-of-control driver hit him. He's had emergency surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| We think he's going to be fine, but it was a very bad accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=29)|
| 0:00:33| and he was doing everything he was supposed to and had the proper markings up and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=33)|
| 0:00:36| but he's at UT Hospital and had emergency surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=36)|
| 0:00:39| His name is Roy Chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=39)|
| 0:00:40| So that being said, I'll ask Ms. Pilo to ask the invocation and Mr. Becker will lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=40)|
| 0:00:49| Our Heavenly Father, it is good to come before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=49)|
| 0:00:55| It's good to come to you with the things that are heavy on our hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| And we call upon you to give your blessings and your healing power to Roy Chance as he recovers from surgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=59)|
| 0:01:10| and begins to regain full use of his body so that he may continue to be an employee of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=70)|
| 0:01:18| We are so grateful for those who do give every day their very best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=78)|
| 0:01:25| that this may be the wonderful city that it is in which to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| So often we forget those whose names we don't know and whose jobs we aren't even familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=90)|
| 0:01:37| But we know that you are aware of their commitment and of their personal lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=97)|
| 0:01:44| and the many things they go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| So we pray your blessings on all the employees of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| and also the state of Tennessee and this great country of ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| whose lives enrich all of our lives in many unknown ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| We pray that you'll be with us tonight as we consider these important issues before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=132)|
| 0:02:20| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=140)|

| 0:02:48| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of our last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Not items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| I'd like to ask for a four-week postponement of 9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| I believe there's been some reasonable questions raised and we need some time to sort it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| 9C is the item dealing with the analogy cable franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| Any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| What was the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| I'm taking the lights or other items unless I see a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| All those in favor of postponing for four weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| You should have a document in front of you from Scenic Knoxville, a position statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| Additionally, in your packet in the council office was a letter from Attorney for Lamar Alexander, Lamar Advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=226)|
| 0:03:58| And both sides would like to get a postponement of 12C, I believe it is, for at least four weeks as we have our law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=238)|
| 0:04:07| department look at some issues and continue the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| I think also Councilman Becker is having a request for a possible workshop also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| It was for how long, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| I think Councilman Becker, did you have a comment or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Well, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| I think Ms. Pilo raised an issue in the workshop about how far out it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| It's at least May until we can have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| And just to say it, it feels like we can deal with this a little quicker than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| If we can't fit a workshop in before then, I'd say we just deal with it on an agenda or even look at a workshop on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| non-workshop night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| The motion is for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| And Councilman Becker, I think anything that any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Well, again, is four weeks enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| I mean, we're looking at having to try to work all those logistics out just like you talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| Is that enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| It may not be enough, but it is an opportunity to come back and at least get an update on where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| And talking to, I think, Mr. Greve, who was here four weeks, may not be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| But it's an opportunity for Council to see it once again, pop up, and to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| It may not be enough time for our law director to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| But I think it gives us an opportunity to have it sort of tagged to pop back up, kind of calendared to pop back up to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Well, yeah, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| I guess if we're going to have to have some sort of discussion, further process, workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| If you'd like to get it six weeks or eight, I'll be glad to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| I'd like to see it go more than four, I think, because I don't think that's going to get us anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| Motion for it to go to six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Yeah, Mr. Becker, and then we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Make a motion for six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| I was doing four because that was a request for four weeks, I know, for Lamar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| And then I think Senator Knox just wants enough time also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| So I'm not married to four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| That was just what was asked for the motion to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| And we can make it six weeks, eight, whichever you'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| Six weeks is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Mr. Becker, and then I'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Yeah, I guess my sense is four weeks is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| This has been an issue that's been churning in the city for about a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| And, you know, we had a workshop on this last God only knows when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| And I think there's new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| But I'd hate to put this off a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| I think also keep in mind that this also impacts the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| And while the billboard stuff has been, you know, moratorium since whenever years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| the electronic message center stuff sort of just started in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| People were in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| People were about to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| So I don't want to delay this longer than we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| So I'd be inclined to say let's look at four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| And if we have to delay after that, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Ms. Peeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Well, I'm very inclined to go along with what Councilman Becker said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| And, you know, just my personal experience is when you have six weeks to do it, it takes six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| When you have eight weeks, it takes eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| And I just feel having attended the MPC meeting where this was heard and having, as Mr. Becker says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=420)|
| 0:07:08| we've already spent some workshop time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| I think we really need to get committed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| The electronic message board, of course, that's coming up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| But there's some issues there with some folks that have definitely been delayed in an unfortunate way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=436)|
| 0:07:24| And we need to make some decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Anything else on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| I'd like to recognize Dwayne Greve if he would like to speak to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| Are you interested in saying anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Mr. Chair, we're definitely in favor of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| I've been in conversations with David Jarnigan, with Lamar, and also with their attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| And we both see that with the MPC wanted to put forward that there are problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| Let me just say that whether it's four weeks, six weeks, or eight weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| I think Ms. Pelow has a good point that if we put a time limit on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| we're going to do something about it as far as dragging it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| Let me just say real quickly that I've really just gotten involved in this in the last three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| And you have in front of you a position paper with a list of questions that have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| And some very basic questions that the city is not able to answer at this time has to do with, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| where are the billboard sites, where they're located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| Is there any documentation as far as actual maps of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| I've been in conversation with Lamar over the control or regulations of the information that MPC has put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=514)|
| 0:08:43| and also that the Mayor's Advisory Committee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| And we feel that there's just a number of questions that have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| We also think that there's a number of cities and communities across this country who have done everything from banding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| digital billboards to billboards all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| And I think that maybe we can learn from those cities and especially cities that are more comparable in size to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| I think the other basic thing is that we really need to realize what the vision of our city is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| We're both a combination of a river town and a mountain town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| and our scenic beauty is something that we all need to be concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| And I think we need to look very seriously at what decisions we make in regard to the billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| and where they're located and what they look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| I also think that the other thing we need to consider is that we're trying to be a green city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| trying to be a green community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| And we need to look at what are we talking about in terms of the digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| in terms of electrical usage and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| So the main thing, though, is that there is good communication between Lamar and us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| and I think we'd like to have that opportunity to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| And if it's four weeks, six weeks, I just think we need as much input as we can at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| And also citizen involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Anybody else have anything on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Right now the motion on the floor is for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Postpone four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Ms. Petalo, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Mayor Haslam, I would move that we postpone item number 9A, this time for four weeks is the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=618)|
| 0:10:28| This is a B drive north of North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| Any other comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Motion carried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| This is for item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| I would move to postpone that to the first meeting in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| This is something that, you know, we had a workshop on, I guess, three weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| It wouldn't be coming into effect right now because there will be no property tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| in this upcoming budget, and that's the only way it would get to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| Is that an announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| So that would be the only way it would get to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| And so we need to see how it's going to shake out in other localities, whether they're municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| or county forms of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| So I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| That's July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| The actual meeting is July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Any further questions on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| All those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Miss Bueller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Mayor Hasselmyer, let's see, are we adding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Anything else to be postponed and then we'll come to added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Now you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Anything to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| I move that we add actually, item two items, item number 11Q and 11R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| They are in conjunction with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| We will take those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| All those in favor of adding 11Q and 11R?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Okay, those items are added. Anything else to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Okay. I don't think we have any consent items this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| Okay. Really quick. Actually, go ahead with 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| 6A is an application for renewal of a retailer certificate for Carroll A. Seaman DBA Frontier Package Store, 1041 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Okay. Any comments? All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| Real quick, Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| I want to thank those of you who attended the neighborhood conferences past Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| On a cold, snowy Saturday, we had about 150 attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| Is that right, Madeline? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| So thank you for helping to community development and the Knox County Office of Neighborhoods and our Office of Neighborhoods for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| I want to be one of the first to wish an early happy birthday to Steve Hall, whose birthday is tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| We won't ask him what number that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| Are you going to sing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| That's my present. I won't sing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| And I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| We opened today the gallery of the portraits of former mayors today on the fifth floor atrium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| and some folks with Citi have prepared a wonderful history of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| If you haven't had a chance to check that out, please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| It's a great little historical guide there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| Okay. That is it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| Reports from council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| Man, we're quiet today. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| 8A is a resolution to appoint the membership of the Transportation and Mobility Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| Requested by council members Bailey and Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| I'm glad to be co-chairing this with Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| I think this is a real important issue really because of the nature of where we're located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| with three major interstate systems converging here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| and we're having had seeing a lot of growth and construction and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| But I think we ought to, you know, consider how we grow and grow smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| And I think we've got a lot of knowledgeable and experienced members on here on this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| from the University of Tennessee and Congressman Duncan's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| and, of course, the council members, appointees, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| But I think their advice and recommendations are going to prove to be an asset to the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| and future administrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| I'd like to thank Donna Buckman, who is my appointee to this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| and chair of Fountain City Connections for coming down tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| and thank her for her service on this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| and also would like to make a correction in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Her name is misspelled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| I believe it's B-U-E-C-K-M-A-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| And it's printed twice in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Clark Hamilton is listed here as my appointee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| and that is who I intend to try to get to a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| but I haven't had that conversation with him as yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| So this may be a little premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| So noted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| We will amend that to remove his name for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| I just wanted to follow up with Councilman Bailey's statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| I think it's going to be a great opportunity to begin to address some of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| in a way that council hopefully will be able to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Council and all the appointees, I think we're off to a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| You know, Mr. Hall, I think we've traded some karma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| because while the person you intend to appoint is on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| the one I have appointed isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Actually, either of the ones I appointed aren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| and I'm wondering what Mr. Holquist has decided on that because we had talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=939)|
| 0:15:49| and I thought we had an answer on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Well, I thought so, too, and I'm not sure why it's not on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| I apparently missed going over it and not spotting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| I apologize that I didn't spot it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| That was Bill Terry, and that information was transmitted, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=959)|
| 0:16:06| I don't know where that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=966)|

| 0:16:17| I'm not saying you were responsible by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| I don't know what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| So should we amend it to add Bill Terry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| I think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=984)|

| 0:21:47| of improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| So I'm committed to seeing Cumberland fixed in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| You know, does it happen as soon as I might like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| I mean, I think it has to be balanced with we have to see, I have to see what the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| tag is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Mr. Becker, I think you know where I stand on this and that I do feel good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| And you probably noticed that the city's surface transportation funds, federal dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| STP dollars the city gets are being allocated 2008 through 2011 fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| That's a big chunk of those monies that aren't going other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| So that's, you're right, we need to know that that's a good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| I think the mayor believes it is or he wouldn't have, you know, wanted to make that allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| But I believe it's going to pay off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| And I think we're going to see some real benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| There was an article in, I believe it was the Wall Street Journal in the last few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| about universities and cities that are renovating and restoring areas around their campuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| like this all over the country because it's so important to these major universities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| And we do, we know that UT wants to see this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| And we believe that they'll be a good partner too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Councilman Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Actually, I was kind of wondering the same thing when I was going over this Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| You know, I'm concerned about Cumberland and the flow of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| but I'm also concerned about the flow of other things elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| the flow of water in Fountain City and the 4th and 5th District in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| I know we've been putting money in that, and that's a problem that's been there for a real long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| It obviously impacts people's homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| So I'm anticipating more money in the budget coming up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| Well, and some of us have districts where we're concerned about water not flowing and standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| and it's right behind folks' homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| So I know about the water situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| I just want to say all excellent comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| I, too, have a lot of these same questions, and I guess kind of falling in a different vein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| but very similar to what Councilman Frost has said with regards to his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| You know, the Magnolia Avenue Corridor study is going to be done very soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| and I'm looking forward to advocating and hopefully getting support to take a look at that also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| because that's a very viable corridor down the line and get into the TPO process down the line also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| So we've got a lot of things that need to be taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| and I'm glad that once again Councilman Becker was a catalyst to at least have us put some things out on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| so that we all know that while we're supportive of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| we want to make sure that we know what the price ticket is going to be to taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| and that there are other areas that need to be looked at also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| I'll just comment real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| I mean, I don't disagree with what anybody has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| I think this is how the process starts as you apply for this money to begin the funding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| Does it mean that we're going to allocate all of our money in the next year or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| We're going to obviously be fiscally wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| You all met and talked about that and the importance of the city's financial condition early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| I do think it's the right thing to do, and hopefully we can do it sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| It depends on financial realities, and we've got a lot of other obligations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| I do think it's appropriate to go ahead and start lining this up now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| and I think it's in the big picture of what we're doing as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| But your comments are noted, and as we're starting to wrestle through the budget now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| there's, as usual, a lot more worthy things to spend money on than there is money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| So, I guess we need to vote, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1510)|

| 0:26:09| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| I meant to call and ask Director O'Hara this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Mr. Dyckman is doing a lot of, I think, work out there and trying to build some houses and doing some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| How many pieces of property, if you know, has he gotten through the homemaker program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| I know he does some good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| I think it's the same gentleman I'm remembering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| He's already done a couple of projects, hasn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1590)|

| 0:26:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| All in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1599)|

| 0:26:43| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a lease purchase agreement between the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| and Smith Turf and Irrigation for equipment necessary to operate and maintain the city's two public golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Yeah, I wanted Joe Walsh, if he could, to come forward and just sort of give us an explanation of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| and where the funds come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| I'd be glad to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Councilman, that funds, the bid came in at $377,000 for all that equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| and basically that's some top dressers, some mowers, aerators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| just various and sundry equipment to operate golf courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| The major intent is this equipment will go toward Knoxville Municipal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| but because of the situation we have set up between the two golf courses being managed by the same corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| they'll be sharing that equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| This lease is about $6,900 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| and that will be part of the operating budget for Knoxville Municipal Golf Course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| and it is part of the budget they presented to us when they took over operation in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Any other questions for Joe or any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1671)|

| 0:28:19| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Mayor, I think Ms. Buckman would like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Donna Buckman, 2417 Ridgecrest Drive in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| Just wanted to say thank you so much for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| I'm representing Fountain City Connections here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| This is a wonderful proposal to put the loop around the skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| This loop will add to the ability of all ages and all users to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| We know that the skate plaza is going to be very popular among our young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| but this loop around the plaza is going to add to all ages really being able to use this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| It's also going to be a great connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| It will be part of the connection that we ultimately have in mind between Fountain City Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| and then the Adair Park and the Adair Greenway, so part of the bigger picture there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| And if I could, just a reinforcement of the next issue that you're about to take on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| and that is the Saramore Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| It was wonderful last night to see the turnout at the Parks and Rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| I said the parkway, the park plan that they had at the expo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| They had a lot of maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1762)|

| 0:29:39| They want sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| And I think that the Saramore Greenway, especially going up to the Arboretum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1780)|

| 0:31:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| This is something that obviously City Council remembered and all supported when originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| passed in December of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| There have been some meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| I've been able to attend some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| You know, these are just recommendations and we're obviously very appreciative of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| that Stephanie Brewer-Cook and Mark Donaldson and other folks at MPC and the city have put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| I think at some point we need to start exploring taking some of these recommendations and acting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| A number of months ago discussed that there are some organizations out there that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| building handicap accessible ramps for people to get into their own home and they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| it at no cost and volunteer labor is my understanding, yet people are reporting them for not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1953)|
| 0:32:42| a building permit and causing all sorts of grief for the good Samaritans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| And Ms. Rojera and I have talked about that in the past and about how we might need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| explore about in situations like that when you're trying to help out someone, move around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| and stay in their own home as long as possible, about waiving those fees for permitting like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| I guess, Councilman Frost, I wanted to, well, first I wanted to thank you for being involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I know it was something everybody on council cared about and I'm glad you made it to at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| least some of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| That's some more than the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| And I guess I wanted to ask about the follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| I mean, I'd like to, I think there's some interesting recommendations, some voluntary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| programs talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Do you have a sense of what would be the next step or how things are going to move to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| next step or does somebody, what we should be watching for or trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2011)|
| 0:33:40| Mark or Madeline, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| I can just reiterate what the recommendations were very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| One was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| I think maybe the question is what happens from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| I think the recommendations lay out a path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| The first recommendation is to look towards the city's community development department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| to look at opportunities to build the demand and the supply of visitable homes in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2043)|
| 0:34:13| And then working with Stephanie's group to create a voluntary certification program to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2053)|
| 0:34:23| help builders of homes market them if they do follow through on visitable features in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| their homes and then to create some information brochures that can be distributed through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| the city's building permits and codes departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| I can tell you that we are already incorporating visitability into some of our houses through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| We currently have three replacement houses under construction that will be visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| In addition, our CHOTOs, particularly Knox Housing Partnership, they have voluntarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| I think, already built one that's visitable and we have seven that they're building that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| are also going to be, we hope, LEED certified, silver, energy efficient, and visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| There's seven of those that they will be building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| And so, though we haven't adopted a policy that says that all of our houses must be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| because there are some issues still to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| We're reading this report, but a couple issues are the topography of the land might make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| very expensive to have a zero-step entry, and so there may be some places where we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2130)|
| 0:35:40| can't afford to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| The internal designs in terms of making the doors, doorways wide enough and the bathrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| that's probably something much easier to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| But there are some issues, too, about the infill housing guidelines and what would be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| for a ramp or something like that, how that might fit in with infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| So there's still many issues to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| We personally in the department, we're trying to move towards visitability when we can in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| So we do accept this report and it will guide some of our future discussions and planning efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2177)|

| 0:37:24| I wanted to celebrate a couple weeks ago, and Mayor Haslam suggested we should wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| a couple weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| And I told him, maybe sometimes you just have to celebrate the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| Because I guess I wasn't as optimistic, but everything's turned out great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| And I really think we have a lot to celebrate in Knoxville, and our partnership with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| university is just very vital to the vitality of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| We'll note that even the University of North Carolina graduate voted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| I saw the look on Marilyn's face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Marilyn, I enjoyed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B, Zoning Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| regulating the Size of Residential Accessory Buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2283)|
| 0:38:09| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Okay, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Do we have people signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| We do have one person signed up, Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| Charlotte, if you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| I reside at 104 Crawford Road, and I'm here to represent Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| And I was sitting there thinking, I signed up to talk against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| and I really don't know if I should be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| I don't know what the amendment says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| So I don't know really whether or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Why don't you tell us what you think, and then we'll figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| As Fountain City Town Hall, we are opposed to the most recent change that MPC has proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| in regard to the Knoxville Zoning Ordinance increasing the maximum size of an accessory building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| During recent months, MPC's proposals have advanced from 750 to 900 to 1,100 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2338)|
| 0:39:09| and now the proposal is that an accessory structure shall not exceed the size of the principal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| In Section 4 of Article 5, there's a provision that contradicts this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| It states, in part, each permitted accessory use shall be subordinate in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2362)|
| 0:39:32| There could be a number of negative results of this recommendation if this recommendation is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| Someone will only need to have a building permit to build an accessory building up to the size of the principal residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| There's no other public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| A very large accessory building will give someone a greater opportunity to run a business out of their home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| especially a business that needs warehouse space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| Accessory buildings are generally not built to the same standards of the principal residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| This change could dramatically change the character of neighborhoods that have small to medium homes on large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2407)|
| 0:40:17| We hope that you will consider an alternative change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| such as that the accessory building could be up to 50 percent of the size of the principal structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2421)|
| 0:40:29| but not to exceed 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| We do feel that it's a good move to have MPC review a request for a larger accessory building as a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2432)|
| 0:40:42| one reason being that MPC is better equipped in BZA to evaluate the overall impact of a larger building size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2442)|
| 0:40:51| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| I'm not sure whose light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| I'm going to start over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Go ahead, Councilman Hucklis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Well, there seems to be some questions, at least based on what Charlotte said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| and from what I've heard from at least one other person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| that they're really a little uncertain as to what the implications of the most recent amendment to this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| And I'm not sure if it's appropriate to try to act on this tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| or if we ought to give it a little more time so we make sure everybody knows what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| But I'm not ready to make a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| I want to hear what other people have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| Councilman Pelo, and then I'll come to Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| I've got an amendment to offer, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Okay, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| I've just heard some concerns today, too, and the concern was that we postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| But now if you have something to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| Okay, why don't you go ahead with your amendment, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| I'd like to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| And I think, Mr. Swanson, I think what I want to do is change every place it says in our. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| What page are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Our ordinance here where it says Option A, change that to Option B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| Where are you on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Well, I'm in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| And what we want to do, if you all know, what actually got adopted by MPC is, well, maybe it's not Option B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| I have Option B here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| This thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| The alternative proposal, I think, is how they referred to it at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| Is Option B in our packet, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| So I think I want to amend this to change Option A to Option B so that what we're adopting is this chart that's on page 10 of our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2542)|
| 0:42:30| Do we have the nomenclature right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Are we calling the right thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| The alternative proposal is how they called it at the MPC, and that's what you're moving. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| That is what I'm moving to do, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Dan, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Well, let's see if there's a second first to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| I'll come back to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Let's go to Miss Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Well, the question that came to me, and, of course, I've heard Charlotte's comments prior to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| The question that came to me today, and I guess, Mr. Donaldson, you can probably more quickly respond to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| is that there is nothing to clarify where on the property that accessory building will be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2584)|
| 0:43:12| Is there anything to prevent that from being located in front of the primary residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Tell me where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Because that was the question, and I simply wasn't prepared to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| For example, under the area regulations front yard, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2611)|
| 0:43:43| for dwellings the minimum depth of the front yard shall be 25 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| and in no case shall an accessory building be located or extend into the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| So then if you turn to the definitions of the front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| it defines the area between the street and the house as the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| So it's saying that no accessory building shall be built between the house and the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2645)|
| 0:44:13| And that's contained in the base zone, not in this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| I mean, that's addressed in the R1, not in the accessory building ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| My concern was that the wish was that that was contained within this ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| Councilman Becker, now I'll come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Let me just say a word about the amendment and then sort of my desire to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| What the challenge has been, I think, when we dealt with this, I don't know, six weeks, eight weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| was sort of this static, you know, there's one size fits all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| What the amendment does, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| is it breaks it down to say that the size of the accessory building is related to the size of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| And it has limits both on how much is allowed by right and how much is allowed by a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| There are definitely some limits on where it can go that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| I'm going to say this might not be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| There might be need for a little more fiddling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| But I'm real concerned about the situation we're putting BZA in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| And I know I've attended several of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| BZA for years has been saying that the system of sending variances on accessory buildings to BZA doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| I think we've all agreed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| It makes much more sense to put variances at MPC through the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2726)|
| 0:45:31| I'm worried that BZA is currently sending pretty much everything up to city council, even when it's a very clear decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2731)|
| 0:45:39| And that's adding a lot of time to people and, frankly, expense because they have to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| But a lot of time to people who are trying to build things that are quite legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| I'd like to get this passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| And if we're not 100% satisfied, start another process to make the correction so we would at least ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| I think this moves us 98% of the way to where we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| And I want to see that done as quick as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| Ms. Peter, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Councilman Becker, and then I guess Mark, could that language that you read for me under R1 be added to this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2764)|
| 0:46:18| so that that clarification is within this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| Mr. Swanson, do you need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| Well, you want to have an ordinance that's clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| You have a problem when you start putting the different language with regard to dealing with accessory buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| in different parts of the ordinance because you run the risk that the language may conflict in some way that you don't realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| And so it's much cleaner in an ordinance to have a particular subject dealt with at some portion of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2804)|
| 0:46:52| and not have it dealt with two or three different times within the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| so that the potential for conflict exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| So that's all I would say with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| And maybe Mr. Donaldson would have a different opinion, and I'd be glad to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| I like that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| Ms. Taylor, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| No, I just felt an obligation to make that ask as that had been a concern that was brought to me today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| by someone who's very concerned about their neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Go ahead, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| You know, we've had this come up before, and we've agonized over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| If I recall correctly, I mean, first I want to say I don't have any problem with MPC handling this versus BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| But if I recall correctly, approximately seven a year come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| That's less than one a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| I mean, we recently had one out in the second district where I'm not even sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| That was in excess of 1,500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| But, you know, like I said the last time this came up here, this was debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| One of the very first meetings five of us had up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| And, you know, I'm not seeing that big of a problem, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| Granted, it could be a problem for the people who are applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| But when you start, you know, creating a 1,500 square foot garage as permitted, no level of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2897)|
| 0:48:28| that's bigger than the first three places I ever lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| So, you know, I've got some legitimate concerns about, I mean, that's a pretty nice garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| but you can also do a lot of other things in there that aren't necessarily, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| what should happen in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| So I've got real reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| That one was Pool House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| Mr. Becker, something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Well, you know, Ms. Frost, I actually hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| And you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| It's not, you know, it actually was I thought it was 11 in the course of a year, not seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| But it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| It's not overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| It's not huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| Part of that 1,500 square foot thing, you've got to have more than an acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| Again, part of what this feels like is that I think NBC has responded to most of what council was concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| the last time it kept up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| In most of the city, in those lots that are under 15,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| we're keeping the 750 square foot limit that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| So we're keeping that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| We've got between 15,000 square feet lot and an acre, allowing them to go up to 1,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| And, again, that huge building only comes up when the lots are over an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| And that's not a lot of lots in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| And it's in those places where it is generally fine to do this, big lots that are back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| Again, I can see fiddling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| I'm a little uncomfortable with saying, yeah, that's a use by right as opposed to limiting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| lowering that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| I'm just worried about going another, you know, eight or 12 weeks until we get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| An alternative is to vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| In response to some of these concerns, Mr. Donaldson, I did read all of this again today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| but I don't recall if there is a prohibition on the height of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| I'm trying to imagine in my mind if I have a one-acre lot, a neighborhood full of one-acre lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| and someone builds a 1,500-square-foot accessory building to store a boat or a really tall RV or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| You know, I'm thinking of some of those storage sheds that are three or four stories, three stories tall, say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| Can someone do that under this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| The proposed amendments do not address the maximum height that already exists in the ordinance for accessory buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3047)|
| 0:50:55| which is set at 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| So that's in the main ordinance that's already addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| And that's a big factor in keeping accessory buildings subordinate to primary buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| That's what I was concerned about, is you don't have this building casting a shadow over the primary building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Councilman Hulkos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Well, following up on that, unfortunately in the past there have been some sort of loopholes, ways to get around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| If it's connected to the primary structure, then it's determined to be in addition to the primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3082)|
| 0:51:29| And we saw one like that in Island Home several years ago that created a lot of angst, because it was a one-story house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| We had this large two-story garage accessory building that was supposedly attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3096)|
| 0:51:45| In reality, I think there was a little deck kind of between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| And I think the chief building official, the one then, not the current chief building official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| ruled that it was part of the main structure, primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3116)|
| 0:52:02| And that created a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| So there may be other things that we need to address in terms of tightening up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| but this seems clearly just focused on accessory buildings that are not attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| And so these rules, as Mr. Donaldson said, I guess clearly apply there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| The motion on the floor is to amend and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| Ms. Davis wanted to add any response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| Ms. Davis, would you like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| I guess I have a question for Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| Are you saying that what was the 750 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| That's in the lots of 15,000 or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3161)|
| 0:52:48| Well, I still see problems if someone builds a larger accessory building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3168)|
| 0:52:57| that it could be taken advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| And I know that it has been said that that's why we have codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| but we all know that there are not enough inspectors in the codes department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| to keep up with things that might not be done correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| or according to specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| So, you know, I still have a very great apprehension about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| as you all are talking about passing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| I obviously don't know how other folks are going to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| As far as the options go, probably B is the better of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| But, you know, I assume that might very well get passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| but ultimately I plan to support the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| but I don't think I'll support it overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| We're now voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| All those in favor of the amendment, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Now we're back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Any further comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Now the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| We better do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Councilman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| I heard six ayes and three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| The motion as amended passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| 12D is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B, Zoning Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| Article 4, Section 25IH1, Infill Housing Overlay District, to clarify that the Infill Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| Design Review Committee has the authority to approve lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Questions or comments here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| I maybe should know the answer to this question, but when I was looking over my packet, I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| have my information in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| What's the appeal process with regards to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Is this appealable back to council or just to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| To both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| To MPC first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| I keep, you know, I'm getting a little concerned with some of these, you know, committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| and some of the recent rulings where things are kind of, unlike some other folks, kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| of being taken out of council, saying I want to make sure that while the Design Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| Committee were giving them a little more power, we're not inadvertently taking any of ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| away for an appeal to come back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Is that correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| And this amendment, the guidelines provide a vehicle for development that's within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3343)|
| 0:55:55| context of the neighborhood, which may not be developed under the R1 zone district that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| we've grown to love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| So this amendment flat out says that the committee may vary the dimensional requirements of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3365)|
| 0:56:14| base zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| As a committee, a decision is appealable to the MPC, and then any MPC decision would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3376)|
| 0:56:24| appealable to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Because the more and more I ponder and struggle on this concept plan situation we're in, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| struggle with what goes on with that appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| So I'm just, you know, from now on, I'm going to be asking those questions any time we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| some things with some of our committees and some of these processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| That helps me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3403)|
| 0:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Mr. Donaldson, you may be the best one to answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| The infill housing review committee, how is that constituted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| How are the members selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Who are the members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| It's constituted by members of city departments, community development permitting and codes, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3421)|
| 0:57:12| well as MPC staff members, and then we have one representative from the East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| That is, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| Those positions are explicitly stated as within the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| Yeah, I was thinking of where I just couldn't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| It was the previous ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Yeah, I guess, Mr. Brown, you commented something about, you know, some concern about how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| works, and I was a big fan of the infill guidelines and the infill overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| As an overlay, it has some challenges, and I just wanted to be clear, and Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| can correct me if I'm wrong, but we're creating a new base zone, which will do a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| same things as the infill housing guidelines, and my hope would be that the places that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| now have the overlay would adopt the base zone instead, and I think administratively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| that gets to be a little clearer than an overlay district, and if you want to comment, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Thank you for that opening, and we are working on a new base residential zone district that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3488)|
| 0:58:15| we're tentatively calling R1HK, for HK being heart of Knoxville, that would apply in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| areas within the heart of the city that were developed before the R1 was created and primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| developed at dimensional standards smaller than the R1 base standards, and in doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| we would create design standards as well and move away from guidelines and a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| towards standards that can be approved by someone at a building permits counter or somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| at our counter at MPC so that there are very explicit standards to be applied rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| guidelines that need committee approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| Councilman Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| I had a conversation with Mark earlier because I had some of the same concerns have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| voiced here by Vice Mayor Brown and others in terms of the creation of boards and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3548)|
| 0:59:14| committees and where the public has to go and sometimes talk to these self-serving individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3554)|
| 0:59:23| and moving towards a base zone where it's cut and dry and the standards are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3563)|
| 0:59:28| and there's no need for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| So I was glad to hear that and I just wanted to echo my support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3570)|

| 1:03:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| 12N is an emergency ordinance to rezone property located on the southwest of Anderson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| from No Zone to RP1 Planned Residential District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| at a density up to 5.9 dwelling units per acre, City of Knoxville applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| We've got someone signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| We'll wait for the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| We do have Jamie Rowe signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| Jamie, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike, representing the Tazewell Pike Beverly Station neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| I have a letter from Fountain City Town Hall as well as our entire documentation into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3831)|
| 1:03:58| I don't know whether I wrote 12N on it, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| I'm going to only read excerpts from mine, but even at that, it is quite lengthy, and I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| but there is a long history that really needs to be in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| In the MPC minutes, it says this property, 18 acres, was annexed by the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| and the former owner filed an appeal to court, then sold the property to the current developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Because the applicant in the appeal is no longer the owner, the lawsuit was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| The annexation went forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| This isn't really quite the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| When the owner who filed the appeal sold the property to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| the original owner actually retained a small interest in the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| and thereby did not lose standing before the court on the annexation until very recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| If the property had just been sold outright to the developer in 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| when the property really changed hands, the annexation would have been effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| By delaying the annexation, the developer was able to have the property overseen by Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3897)|
| 1:05:05| and obtained 79 building permits through the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| The lawsuit on the 18 acres resisting annexation was pending before any plan was ever presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3909)|
| 1:05:18| The first plan was presented in July of 2004, almost four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| The property was going to be annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| but the timing depended on when the original owner gave up all interest in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3926)|
| 1:05:32| Yet the fact that that annexation was pending was never disclosed to MPC, County Commission, County BZA, or City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3932)|
| 1:05:44| And they appeared before you all twice, before MPC twice, before County BZA three times, and County Commission twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| And they certainly did not give that information to the neighborhood nor to Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| If this entire property could have been considered a city property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| the property would have had close oversight of city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| The developer received building permits from the county for 79 condos on August 12, 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3968)|
| 1:06:16| even though only 23 condos have been built to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| What does this mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| It means that even if city engineering finds a real problem with the density causing drainage, flooding problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| and even if these problems may cause additional flooding in First Creek that Whites Creek runs into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| where millions of dollars have already been spent and are being spent to minimize flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| it's too late to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| Because building permits were issued two and a half years ago by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4005)|
| 1:06:49| The city will just have to eat whatever the county has approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| The situation is further complicated because there are 12 additional acres of this same tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4013)|
| 1:07:00| that have been in the city for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| And at first, these 12 acres were on the developer's plans and came before city council on two occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| Never being able to get a green light from city council, this portion of the plan was then dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4029)|
| 1:07:16| Our neighborhood is not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| But in a critical watershed like Whites Creek, a part of First Creek, development must be done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| As a neighborhood, all we ever asked from the beginning of this development was to follow all regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4047)|
| 1:07:36| don't short circuit or circumvent the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| and all information given to legislative bodies should be complete and accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| To begin with, the existing RB zoning in that county portion of the property was an error by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4067)|
| 1:07:55| RB was single-family residential, and MPC changed the designation of single-family residential from RB to RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4075)|
| 1:08:05| But MPC failed to change the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| This property was able to be developed in condos simply because MPC didn't correct an error they made many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4088)|
| 1:08:17| Our neighborhood has a long history of problematic drainage and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4097)|
| 1:08:23| Just to give you an example, 30 years ago, my husband and I purchased a 13-acre tract of city property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4103)|
| 1:08:30| two blocks from this property we're discussing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| Our 13-acre tract, two months before we bought it, was on MPC agenda for a subdivision and a sea of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| MPC said, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| That property, our property, due to sinkholes and drainage was not developable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| Yet the property you're discussing tonight is known as the swamp and always has been for good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4134)|
| 1:09:03| Due to a wetland, many more sinkholes than are on our property, and even standing water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| In fact, 30% of the 79 building permits that were issued by the county are in the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4149)|
| 1:09:18| and they required floodplain development permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| I wonder how many residents really know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| Dr. James Smoot, an environmental engineer and hydrologist that we hired on another project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| a couple of blocks from this, reported the following about our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| Any further development of property in the watershed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| which would result in increases in either runoff volume or runoff flows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| would likely have a negative impact on downstream properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| These negative impacts would likely consist of an increased frequency of nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| and or property damaging flooding, reduction of aesthetic value associated with the drainage way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| channel erosion and sediment deposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| Our neighborhood has spent, over the course of this time, $12,000 on geologists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4212)|
| 1:10:21| attorney fees, filing fees, documentation reproduction, videotapes and faxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| and countless hours by neighbors attending meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| doing research regarding the property being discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| Our hope is that information we have amassed, and I have a room full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| will be attached to this rezoning so the history will be in one place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| in case some members of city council or NBC have rotated off when this property is before council again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4246)|
| 1:10:54| We want a zoning on the property that you are considering tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| that will allow the most oversight possible by city council and city engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| because soon, no doubt, the remaining 12 acres adjoining this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| which has been in the city for many years, will be before you for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| We feel this information needs to be in place to help council discern the fate of this fragile 12 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| that adjoins our conservation district, and we have grave concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| Our main concerns are density, drainage, downstream flooding, increased traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| and even possible contamination of eight wells of county residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| that really don't have access to city water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| Please keep in mind they still have permits to build over 50 more condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| just on the 18 acres that's been annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| Keep in mind, too, that the city is taking on a great potential for liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| with the property being rezoned due to approvals that have been made not only by county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| but also by county commission and county BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| The rest of my document reads like a bad soap opera, but it is what it is, so I'm going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| September 13, 2004, the developer and engineer presented his...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| Ms. Rowe, you're closing in on five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| Would it be possible...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| Move to give her two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| You have two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| I'm going to skip some of this, but he, before Fountain City Town Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| told us he would protect the wetland and it would not be disturbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| even though he had filed for a permit to fill in the wetland a month before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| The Jenkins home will be preserved, renovated, and sold with one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| The house was destroyed within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| We plan to build 53 single homes and 39 condos, 93 buildings on 31 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| but building permits were approved for 79 condos on 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| Then Mr. Campbell, the engineer, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| I've just learned that city and state are partnering to improve Tazewell Pike at Briarcliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| At the city council meeting, engineer Parnell said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| There is no money for any road improvements in this area at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| We'll keep as many mature trees as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| Very few trees have been left on the 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| At city council, Mr. Campbell said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| We filed the correct paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| and no left turn on Tazewell Pike to Shenandoah is going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| A council member reminded Mr. Campbell what he had said earlier in the day to the council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4424)|
| 1:13:50| His only requirement is to construct a right turn lane into the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| Then the council member read to Mr. Campbell what he had said at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| Quote, We do have to build a left turn lane on Tazewell Pike to Shenandoah. Unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| When the council member asked Mr. Campbell, Which way is it, Mr. Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| He said, Oh, quote, misstated at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| That requirement of a left turn lane might have been transcribed wrong at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| Upon saying this, the MPC director, who was Mr. Dave Hill at that time, told council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| The condition of a left turn lane on this development was a part of staff report prepared in advance of the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4465)|
| 1:14:34| Ms. Rowe, that's seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| And not a reflection of the meeting, of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| I'd like to give her a couple more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| I would caution you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| Also at the meeting, our attorney was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| And when Mr. Campbell's attorney said that the house would have to be torn down if council did not approve their variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4498)|
| 1:15:06| our attorney on rebuttal said, I seriously disagree with this misrepresentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4506)|
| 1:15:13| The road can be built and still have room for the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| Campbell and his attorney were again asked by a council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| Is there room to leave the house and still put in the road or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| Campbell then admitted, Yeah, there was room for the road and the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| But then the road was torn down anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| They did a traffic study when school was not in session at Shannondale School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| They had to do a second traffic study, which warranted three turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| Do you know how many turn lanes we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| Because it didn't have to come before you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| It never came here the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| Also, the notes were changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| On MPC on August 12th, there was a no-build line of 50 feet around the sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4557)|
| 1:16:04| And that was changed to November 10th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| where it said special building restrictions inside the 50-foot line around sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| There's many more things I could tell you about the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| but I'm going to go on to some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| On May 9th, the developer applied for and received a grading permit from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4583)|
| 1:16:29| but there was no review plan, no nothing, that was submitted to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| So for the next 82 days, I faxed, I phoned, I called, I went to offices of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4594)|
| 1:16:45| Council for MPC, county law director, county engineering, and the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| to see where indeed was the proposal that should have been reviewed by MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4610)|
| 1:16:58| And 82 days later, it was turned into MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| That's nine minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| I won't bore you any longer, but I will tell you that there have been four NOVs served on this place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| three of them from the city before it was even annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| because they've been grading on the city side for over a year unpermitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| And TDEC has filed an enforcement action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| Like for everything that she has, including what she was able to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| and what she wasn't able to share, if she's willing to enter that into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| Yes, she already did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Any comments from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| Right now there's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| I talked to Mrs. Rowe earlier today about the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| and I've heard plenty from people in Fountain City about the ongoing problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| that has happened within the county side of the property and the notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4673)|
| 1:18:01| The planned residential will give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| I mean, it is a comparable zone to what they have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| and I discussed it with Mr. Swanson today, seeking confirmation that things will be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| and can come back before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| I'm certainly appreciative of our engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| and folks like Chris Howley and Brent Johnson and others that work on stormwater issues daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4704)|
| 1:18:34| That's their bread and butter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| And there are other folks that I'm obviously not mentioning, but they also do a fine job, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| So, you know, if this property is going to be developed, I don't mean a lack of respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| but I think it would be a better development done inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| So I move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Mr. King, Mrs. Rowe referred to flooding, and she referred to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| Some of the area, I think, is a floodplain or floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| If this were to, as we're rezoning it, since it has come into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| would it make sense to look at whether or not an F1 overlay were appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| or have your people already looked at this, or is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| I know there are only certain areas, depending on the FEMA maps and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| but I'd just like to have some clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| The F1 or the floodway is determined by the FEMA maps that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| I think the primary situation on this property, it was that there were several sinkholes in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4778)|
| 1:19:46| And had permits been pulled in the county, in the city, I'm sorry, at that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4786)|
| 1:19:54| we had a different regulation for how that development could occur around the wetland and the sinkhole areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4794)|
| 1:20:02| But since the permits have already been issued under the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| we have no discretion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| That's my understanding, that we honor permits pulled prior to the annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4810)|
| 1:20:17| We do monitor erosion sediment control issues aggressively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| But as far as the permit itself, they have typically been honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Even if they violate our regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| Well, that's a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Ms. Rowe referenced approximately 79 building permits being pulled two and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| I don't know if this is Mr. Anderson or Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| I mean, if you all know, how long is a building permit good for in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| I mean, those things eventually become stale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| Do you know, Steve, or anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4866)|

| 1:23:07| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Before you go on, there was an ordinance that we passed a few minutes ago, 12K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| I just wanted to comment that that, at one point, was a very contentious in the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=4994)|
| 1:23:21| At one point, it was an extremely contentious piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| and it didn't look like there was any possibility of developing that and having everyone satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| And I just felt obligated to comment that that's one example of where folks sat down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| and worked out the very best possible result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| And for that reason, Steve, it could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| And they are very satisfied about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080311?start=5025)|
