| 0:00:00| We're getting ready to start our public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee amending the Knox County Charter to modify the appointment process of the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=30)|
| 0:00:59| This is ordinance 08-8-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=59)|
| 0:01:05| Do we have anyone that would like to speak on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| Former Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| I would just like to ask former Commissioner Davis one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| As I understand this change, this ordinance, what has changed from an initial draft was that this is now about the County Commission voting on members of this Charter Review Committee individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=82)|
| 0:01:36| Correct. It's just the makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| Instead of as a slate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| But the provision that these items would come back to County Commission for a separate vote has been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=101)|
| 0:01:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Any and all involved to have that clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| I think that's all those wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| I just had one other thing, just for the record and all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| Would you explain to everyone that's here how the citizens on that or how the Charter Review Committee will be, what it will consist of and how it's appointed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=118)|
| 0:02:11| Well, what I envision, what is similar to how the Ethics Committee is appointed, is that the Mayor has half of the appointments and that the Commission has half of the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=131)|
| 0:02:21| But now with regard to Commission, and since it only has nine members, we would probably need to work out whether the Mayor chose five and Commission chose four or vice versa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=141)|
| 0:02:33| And it would probably be in the Commission's interest to have the Mayor pick five and then the Commission as themselves pick the remaining four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=153)|
| 0:02:41| You're talking about in addition to the nine members of the Commission, one from each district that's on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| Because the way it stands now, I believe, and the Law Director can correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| is that the consistency of the Charter Review Commission is that there's nine commissioners, one from each district, and those are picked by the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=175)|
| 0:03:04| Right. I would like to split that to where the Mayor picked five and then the Commission picked four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Yes, but I think we need to make that very clear before we vote on this, if this is going into the Charter, rather than saying it has to be decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| because I can just see that getting all tied up in an argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| Because the way it is now is that what consists of the Charter Review Committee is there's nine commissioners and then there's at least ten citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=200)|
| 0:03:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| And the way it is now, the Mayor appoints which commissioner he wants from each district and the Mayor appoints the ten citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| Correct. He's in control of all appointments. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| Now, this commission does not have any control over the commissioners. I mean, those are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| But the minimum of ten citizens, and I think he can even appoint 20 citizens, we either vote those all up or down in a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=228)|
| 0:03:58| And the proposed change is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| The proposed change is that of the nine commissioners that are appointed, the Mayor would pick five, the Commission would pick four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=242)|
| 0:04:13| Of the citizens group, a minimum of ten, the Mayor would pick five, the Commission would pick five, or it goes up to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=253)|
| 0:04:25| So that would be nine and nine. So it would either be five to nine or five to nine members that the Mayor would appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=265)|
| 0:04:35| And then once those individual names were, everyone knew who those names were, you would vote on them on an individual basis instead of as a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=275)|
| 0:04:45| I don't have the actual wording of this proposed charter amendment in front of me, but is it spelled out exactly how that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=285)|
| 0:04:54| Because you said just a second ago that would have to be decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| Well, in reading it, no, it just basically says that the Mayor would appoint half and that the Commission would appoint half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| So if you would like to make that change to Mr. Owings, that it's clear and that is specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| This is half of the citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| The half of the citizens, the Mayor would appoint half and the Commission would appoint half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| That number is an even number. The only odd number is the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| So that, I believe, Dr. Briggs, is what you're specifying, that you would like to make sure that that's clear. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| I just think I want to make it clear just so we don't in the future have any confusion over exactly how the committee is supposed to be organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=332)|
| 0:05:41| Organized and appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Is that clear, Mr. Owings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Yeah, we'll need to put something into that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| I mean, basically what it says now is subject to the approval of the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| the Mayor shall nominate one half of the membership of the Charter Review Committee, each nominee to be voted upon individually by the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| And the County Commission shall appoint one half of the membership of the Charter Review Committee, each nominee to be voted upon individually by the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=358)|
| 0:06:07| So what we could do, since the Commission nominations is an odd number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| specify it to where the Mayor would appoint five or nominate five, and then Commission would nominate four commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Is that spelled out where we have one from each district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Because that's how it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| That would have to be my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| The Charter Review Committee, you can change it any way you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| We can change it the way we want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| But the Charter Review Committee, as in the amendment here, shall be composed of one member of the Commission from each Commission district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| and at least ten, but not less than the majority, registered voters of Knox County who are not members of the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| with not more than two such voters being residents and registered voters in one Commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| I'd like to keep just one commissioner from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| I think that that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Vice Chair Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Commissioner Davis, who would decide how many citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| Because it says half being picked by the Mayor and half by the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| Would it still be we would just follow the lead of the Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| So if he picks five, then the Commission would pick five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| Or would it be that if he picked nine, then the Commission would pick nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| Who takes the lead on that is a question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| I think that you should be prepared to have nine citizens' names ready in that event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| and then just negotiate that with the Mayor and say how many people do you wish to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| and discuss that with the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| And then if he would have a list of five to nine names, then you could as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| And then that way, as a group, collectively, you could determine how large or how small you wanted to make that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=470)|
| 0:07:58| Mr. Law Director, do you see that working that way or do we need to specify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| It's certainly better if we specify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| It makes it clearer for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| Right now, I believe you can have up to about 27 members of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| Right. That's the nine commissioners and then 18 citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| So if you wanted to decide right now to just make it a 19-member body only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| ten citizens and nine commissioners, you could do so right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| And then that way it would make it very clear as to what the makeup of that body would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| I think just try to keep things as simple as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| If we're going to do this, have the Mayor appoint five, commission appoint five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| and I think, you know, because you have one member from each district that serves on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| one commissioner from each district, I think it would be simpler just to have the commission appoint the nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=534)|
| 0:09:04| I mean, because if you start out with five and four, then, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| the Mayor could put somebody from the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| and then, you know, you're going to have to take somebody from the rest of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| So I think it would be simpler if we're going to do this to just have the commission, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| one of the two commissioners are going to have to sit on the Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| And one of us are anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| It won't be the senior man in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| You know, that's the way our other committees are made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| So if you're putting that as a motion, I'd --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| Well, I think that's just simpler and people understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Make it a little easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Well, we're going to vote on this on the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| This is just a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Could you repeat that, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Because I think the law department would have to craft something up to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| It would be a 19-member committee, five members appointed by the Knox County Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| five members appointed by this body, and then one commissioner from each district has to sit on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| so the commission appoint nine commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| That may be useful, Commissioner Moore, in that one commissioner may have a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| and may not be able to serve, and so, you know, as your district mate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| you could discuss it between yourselves as to who would want to sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| No, we couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| You could in an open meeting or on commission forum, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| Not behind closed doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| I think that's a good idea, the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| I think it's a great idea, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| What I'm wondering about is since this passed on first reading, and isn't there a time schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| Don't we need to pass this on a second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| Well, we're having the next meeting on the fifth, and then we're going to vote on the fifth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| so it can get to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| But what I want to ask the law director is how much can we change this and still have a second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| Bill Lockett will tell you that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| He may have a different opinion than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| and I wouldn't want to say something that would be contrary to what he might advise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| But I would be interested in your opinion, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| Because if we get here on the fifth and all of a sudden we have different interpretations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| then that kind of torpedoes the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| What you look at as far as an ordinance, and I believe what he would advise you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| would be that you have to look and see if there is a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| It's a judgment call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| Is the change substantial enough that it would bring it back to basically make it a first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=698)|
| 0:11:47| So that would be up to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| You all can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| You can pass it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| You can revise it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| Really, that should be his call, because he'll be the one that has to defend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=716)|
| 0:12:04| I don't think we're changing it that much as tweaking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| The changes that we're talking about here really are just a clarification of what the ordinance says now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| So I don't really see that as a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| You know, I'm actually becoming less resistant to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| But I guess initially, with that said, I'm still looking at this from the lens of there are different ways to get things on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=751)|
| 0:12:43| And one of my issues in this particular method is, okay, there's a way for commission, there's a way for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=763)|
| 0:12:50| and then there's a way for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| And I thought initially the mayor was going to appoint 19, 21, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| and we would have first right of refusal on each individual person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| That's what this body wanted the last time, because there was just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| nine of us and names that half of us knew, a third of us knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| We didn't have any resumes or anything of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| So I thought we wanted a process to individually vet each commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| And what this is doing is we have half, roughly half, of two ways to put things on the ballot or to make changes to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=801)|
| 0:13:35| So, again, I'm just a little hesitant about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| We're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Okay, we're all going to do the great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| But, you know, 20 years from now, if we get a rogue commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| they'll really have an extreme amount of power in either blocking things or putting things on the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| that really probably is not going to serve the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| Because the way this is looking to me, we're going to appoint our commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| and I'm comfortable with that, but then we're going to also appoint this other half of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| So am I right in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| Are we saying that we're going to appoint half and then have a vote on the mayor's half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=854)|
| 0:14:21| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| As I understood it, Commissioner McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| what I understood, Commissioner Moore, to say was that we would nominate five, the mayor would nominate five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| and then we would vote on each of them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| Is that what it says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Is that what it says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| I mean, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Okay, but basically we're going to nominate folks that we're going to vote for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| and then the mayor's going to nominate the other half, and we're going to vote for his half too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| So just something to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Again, but with all that said, I'm less resistant to this than I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| Commissioner McKenzie, you know, you say a rogue commission at some point, if you had a rogue mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| you could have all 19 positions, and even though the commission gets to pick five, that's 19 people picking five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| Yes, but if we had a rogue mayor, we could vote every one of his nominees down individually, if that's what we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| So we still have power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| I think that we're getting an exorbitant amount of power in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=921)|
| 0:15:31| Can I make one more comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| I just agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| You've got one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| You don't want to stay until 11 o'clock tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| But part of our responsibility is that we're the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| and so that's where I feel like we do hold that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| And so that, to me, is the important part, is that we're the legislative body, and we're liable and responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| and we should be doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| And just like Commissioner Moore said, there's 19 of us, and, you know, we can't even agree on lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=960)|
| 0:16:07| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| I'd like to put it on the floor as a motion for what Ms. Davis and Commissioner Moore said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| Well, we're going to vote on it in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| A motion for the law director to write something up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| Oh, he's going to do that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| We don't need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| It's a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Anyone else want to be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Make a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Seeing none, motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Is this my first airplane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080829publichearing?start=1000)|
