| 0:01:59| Councilman Thomas. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| Councilman Fugate. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| Vice Mayor McKenzie. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| Councilman Parker. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=127)|
| 0:02:11| I've noticed that we do more yeses on the Zoom than we do ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| But when we were in the city county building, we did more ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| So maybe there's some level of informality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=139)|
| 0:02:30| Before we get started, I've got a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| We've got six beer permit applications before us tonight, as well as one addendum to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| As you can see, today's meeting, like April's meeting, is being held on Zoom, and that will make things a little different for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| And even though we've done it once before, when I call the names of a business applying for a permit, please raise your hand in Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=165)|
| 0:02:54| If you dialed in by phone, you can hit star nine on your phone that will raise your hand so Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=174)|
| 0:03:02| Johnson can see you. And if you need to mute yourself or unmute yourself, you can do that with star six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| When I call on you, please state your name and address clearly for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| Applicants who are approved pending found documentation will need to bring their completed documents to the business tax office during regular business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=194)|
| 0:03:22| Applicants that have their permits approved tonight can pick up their permits after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| Although that may be more difficult because of the closing time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| So we may have to do that tomorrow. As I'm chairing the meeting, other members will be making motions for the second district tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=211)|
| 0:03:40| Because our meeting is being held on Zoom, all the votes you're going to hear tonight will be done by roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| So let's go ahead and get started. Mr. Johnson, who do we have up first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| Well, first, Councilman Roberto, we have a number of persons signed up as Mark Bird here in the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| Mark, could you please identify yourself? That way I can figure out who these other individuals might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=240)|
| 0:04:09| I've raised my hand if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| It does. I'm going to change the role of the other Mark Birds so that we can make this a little cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=252)|
| 0:04:22| The world isn't ready for more than one Mark Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| OK, I've taken care of one and the other one has appeared to disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| So the Hampton Inn Cedar Bluff is the first on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| OK. Sergeant Coward. No applicable record. Mr. Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| That file is complete. OK. Do we have somebody on the line from the Hampton Inn Cedar Bluff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=289)|
| 0:05:02| I am seeing a Patel, but I think that's for another item of the thumbs up markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=302)|
| 0:05:13| I don't see anyone listed for the Hampton Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| Wasn't a seen Patel listed on the Cedar Bluff as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| Yes. OK. Someone's raised their hand. I'll allow them to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=326)|
| 0:05:39| Hello. Hello. Are you speaking to the Hampton Inn Cedar Bluff or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| No, I got a gas station. OK. Thumbs up market. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| Yeah. OK. We've not come to that yet. Thank you. We'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| Sure. I don't see anybody here for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| OK. But we have no applicable record and we have a complete file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| Any motions or discussions on this one? I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| I'll second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=369)|

| 0:06:50| OK. Mr. Byrd, I understand this one has withdrawn. That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| OK. All right. No need for any more action there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| So, Mr. Johnson, what's our next applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| Pete Cook Bowl. OK. Sergeant Cower. No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=425)|
| 0:07:13| Mr. Byrd. That file still requires the copy of the sales tax registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| and approvals from building inspection, fire prevention and the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| OK. Is someone on the line for us for Pete Cook Bowl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| The only other person in the pool is the mystery Mark Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| I'm going to allow them to speak so we can figure out which applicant they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=457)|
| 0:07:54| Hello. Anyone there? Could you identify yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=474)|
| 0:08:09| We've been able to you to speak. Oh, my name is Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| Oh, yes. You're Pete Cook Bowl then. Yeah. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| OK. Can you tell us a little bit about Pete Cook Bowl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| Oh, it's like a ball at the comedy club. We try to open and I got my food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| That's what I call people. And I'm still waiting for the fire department to expect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| The Corona virus. I think I see anybody come out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| OK. Yeah. But it's a new business. It's just a new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| We just try to open. All right. Thank you for sharing that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you. So, Chair Roberto, I will move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=530)|
| 0:09:00| Second. I have a motion. Do I have a second? Second. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| Any discussion? Seeing none. Mr. Johnson, roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=546)|

| 0:09:39| All right. So moved. Mr. Johnson, what we have up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| Raise market and deli. Mr. Bird, I understand this applicant has asked for a deferral to the June agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=584)|
| 0:09:52| Is that correct? That is correct. OK. Well, do I have a motion to move this item to the June agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=592)|
| 0:10:03| Make a motion to do a second. OK. I'm hearing a motion a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| Any discussion that. I thought I heard something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=608)|
| 0:10:16| OK. Hearing no discussion on the motion to move to the June agenda. Mr. Johnson, please call roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=616)|

| 0:10:33| Councilman Roberto. Yes. Councilman Singh. Yes. Councilman Smith. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| Councilman Testerman. Yes. Councilman Thomas. Yes. Councilman Fugitt. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| All right. So moved. Mr. Johnson, what do we have up next? Tailgating for a cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=648)|
| 0:10:57| And Sergeant Coward. No record. And Mr. Bird. That file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=657)|
| 0:11:05| It's always good to hear. Is there anyone on the line for us from tailgating for a cause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| Garrett Thompson is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| Are you there for us? There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| Yep. I'm here. All right. Hey, can you tell us a little bit about tailgating for a cause?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| Sure. We are a nonprofit here in town that puts on events for local charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| We have actually already applied for this beer permit, but we've had to move the date from June 20th to August to comply with the city's phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=697)|
| 0:11:49| So we we wanted to go ahead and do that. OK. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| I'll move to approve. Chair, I have a question, please. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| OK. So could you tell us how many people you anticipate at this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| Well, we are restructuring the event actually to comply with whatever the city rolls out next in terms of mass gatherings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=725)|
| 0:12:17| We have typically hosted one session that saw about 2000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| And instead of doing one session, we're going to break it up into multiple sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| And depending on what those new guidelines are going to look like will kind of depend on how many sessions we'll need to do throughout the two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=747)|
| 0:12:37| We're going to keep the same footprint that we've had before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| but we're going to actually remove about half of our beer vendors to help out with spacing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=760)|
| 0:12:48| as well as remove our reusable cups and use disposable cups to lower transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| We've got a whole social distancing and sanitation plan for the event as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=775)|
| 0:13:04| OK, so I am a little nervous about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| However, I think if we move to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| I know that you will be bound by the guidance from the health department and the city as it relates to where we may be in this in the COVID stage and reentry by that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=792)|
| 0:13:23| So question for our beer chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| Chair Roberto, in the event that there is not guidance that allows for gatherings over, let's say, 50 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=808)|
| 0:13:41| and this just would not accommodate this particular event and they needed to reschedule it again with their beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=821)|
| 0:13:50| is it only good for these dates and then they would have to come back before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| Or, Mr. Frosk, can someone maybe address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| Yes, they would have to come back for the new date because the public notice is given for a specific time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=838)|
| 0:14:11| I'm sure they would pass again, but they would have to come back for a new date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| But they would not be charged any additional fees or anything since it would not be any part of their own if they had to reschedule again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| Personally, I don't know. Maybe Mr. Byrd might know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| Yes, they wouldn't be charged an additional fee if that had to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| Since, as you say, it wasn't due to their fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| I can't get the gallery again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| I was just going to say, apparently that's what happened this time because they were approved April 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| It looks like they were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| April says they were approved for the first at a beer board meeting for June 19th and 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| So was that last April they got approved for this June and then had to reschedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Yes, we were in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=908)|
| 0:15:14| I had a couple of different people speaking at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Y'all, I'm so confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| We're in May now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| So we approve for June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| We're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| But but you are correct that we have previously approved it for a different day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| And now we're approving it for the new date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| So the same thing would happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Yes, I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Mr. Frost and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Did I say that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Well, I'll enjoy it while I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| So I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| Yeah, I moved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| So we had a motion to approve and we had a second on tailgating for cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=962)|

| 0:16:48| All right, Mr. Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| The file still requires a copy of the sales tax registration as well as building inspections, fire prevention and health department approvals, and the surrender of the existing beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1012)|

| 0:18:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| I believe that takes us to our addendum. Is that correct, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| And what do we have up next Aurora restaurants and grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| to me like this was approved pending final documentation back in October and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| still needing a few items. What are they still needing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| We still require a copy of the sales tax registration, a written plan for server| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| compliance, and building inspections, fire prevention, and the health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| Okay. Mr. Johnson, do we have anyone on the line from Aurora Restaurant and Grill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1148)|
| 0:19:16| We do not. Mr. Bird informed me that the applicant, Mr. Edward Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| was planning on phoning in to the meeting and he does not appear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| Okay. Mr. Bailey, if I may, I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| I was just going to say Mr. Bailey, when I spoke with him yesterday, did express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| kind of an uncomfortability with technology and I had at that time involved his daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| emailing her. He provided her on the phone and I emailed her the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| To kind of hope to be an assistance, but I don't know how well that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| panned out if he's not able to have logged in here presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1205)|
| 0:20:13| Okay. Well, it certainly seems like there's some additional documentation that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1213)|
| 0:20:21| I'd entertain any motions anyone wants to bring on this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| So, our last motion on this was approval pending final documentation. Is that where we left it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1226)|
| 0:20:35| I believe it would have been a motion to extend if it was approved back in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| Okay. It would only have been good for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| So, meaning we've already given it one extension. Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| He was extended on January 28th. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1250)|
| 0:21:02| So, our options are to give him another extension of 30 or more days or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| If you take no action, it would die and he would have to start over, but I'd respectfully submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1269)|
| 0:21:19| if Mr. Byrd's been in recent conversation with him. I'm not comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| He's still interested in pursuing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| I'd like to entertain a motion for a 30-day extension simply because the person who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| I'd like to entertain a motion for a 30-day extension simply because the person who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| sounds like there's some technology challenges and then with the COVID stuff that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| I would be comfortable with a 30-day extension. However, if we do not have any movement or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| person does not attend for whatever reason, the next one, I would not be comfortable moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1314)|
| 0:22:01| further with any additional extensions. So, that's my motion that I'll put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| We'll see where that goes. I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Okay. We've got a motion to hear this again in 30 days and a second. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-200519?start=1329)|
