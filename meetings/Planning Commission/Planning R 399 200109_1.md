| 2:32:22| One opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9142)|
| 2:32:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| Make a motion to approve the concept plan subject to the eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9148)|
| 2:32:29| We have a motion by Commissioner Eaton, a second by Commissioner Clancy to approve the concept plan subject to eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9149)|
| 2:32:36| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9156)|
| 2:32:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9158)|
| 2:32:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| And I'd like to make a motion that we approve the development plan for up to 70 detached residential dwellings on individual lots subject to the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9162)|
| 2:32:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9169)|
| 2:32:50| We have a motion by Commissioner Eaton, a second by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9170)|
| 2:32:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| To approve the development plan for up to 70 detached residential dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9183)|
| 2:33:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| One opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9187)|
| 2:33:08| And, folks, keep in mind what Commissioner Roth said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9188)|
| 2:33:11| If there is one more lot added to this development, we'll be coming back before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9191)|
| 2:33:23| There will be a traffic impact study, and we'll be coming back before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9203)|
| 2:33:27| And then the traffic impact study, no doubt, will be making some recommendations with regards to road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9207)|
| 2:33:35| Thank you all for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| Happy New Year, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9219)|
| 2:33:40| May I have a clarification, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| In what you just voted and approved, does that remove that addition completely from Pittman, or does that still leave it open for him to make something at a later date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9222)|
| 2:33:53| He would have to revise his plans and have that revised plan approved by this commission in a public hearing in order to access Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9233)|
| 2:34:02| To access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| What we approved is this plan that you're seeing right here that has no access to Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9244)|
| 2:34:08| Well, as I said, though, there's an access in and an access out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9248)|
| 2:34:12| And so that's what, you know, off of Buttermilk and off of Pittman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| So that was my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9257)|
| 2:34:22| Yes, I want to call on Mr. Wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9262)|
| 2:34:26| A little housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| I need you all to back up to item 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9268)|
| 2:34:31| There was a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9271)|
| 2:34:32| It wasn't your fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| It was just a typo in the staff report and the sentence that approved the concept plan subject to the nine conditions was not typed in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9273)|
| 2:34:40| And so we didn't get a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| So we approved the variances, and you also approved the development plan, but you didn't approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9282)|
| 2:34:48| So in order to get this file complete, there needs to be a motion to approve the concept plan subject to the nine conditions, being consistent with the prior motions that you voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9288)|
| 2:35:00| This is agenda item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| If you look at the, it's Meredith Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9302)|
| 2:35:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9305)|
| 2:35:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9308)|
| 2:35:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9309)|
| 2:35:10| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy to approve the concept plan, seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9310)|
| 2:35:15| Is there any, is everybody with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9319)|
| 2:35:20| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9322)|
| 2:35:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9323)|
| 2:35:24| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| You're paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| That's consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| Seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9333)|
| 2:35:37| Mr. Dadsey, welcome back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9337)|
| 2:35:44| Next is agenda item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| The applicant is Peter Dadsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9347)|
| 2:35:50| The location is the south side of Tillery Road, west side of Paris Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| The approximate size of the tract is 5.042 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| The zoning is R1, low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9360)|
| 2:36:04| Existing land use is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| The proposed use is duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| The staff recommendation is to approve the development plan for three duplexes with each duplex on an individual lot subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9371)|
| 2:36:21| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9381)|
| 2:36:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| They may have left the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| Did you have anything you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| Oh, not too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| I mean, I just don't want to take much of your time because I can tell you all our time and then just to move on with staff recommendation to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9390)|
| 2:36:37| So you're good with what staff has recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9397)|
| 2:36:40| Yes, it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9401)|
| 2:36:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9402)|
| 2:36:43| So does anybody on commission wish to debate this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9409)|
| 2:36:50| I'll make a motion to approve the development plan for the three duplexes with each duplex on an individual lot subject to the three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9410)|
| 2:36:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| We have a motion by Commissioner Newton, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the development plan for three duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9419)|
| 2:37:05| I see no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9427)|
| 2:37:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9429)|
| 2:37:10| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9430)|
| 2:37:11| Thank you for sitting through this long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9433)|
| 2:37:14| Hope you enjoyed the entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9434)|
| 2:37:18| That's a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| Next on the agenda is item number 32, and I'm going to just turn this one straight over to Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9441)|
| 2:37:30| This is minor amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9450)|
| 2:37:34| Let me turn to item number 32 to make sure I'm talking about the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| Minor amendments to the newly adopted zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9459)|
| 2:37:44| Most of these are edits and clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9464)|
| 2:37:48| I'll go through them quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| Section 1.4B clarifies and recognizes that the Planning Commission, not the BZA, reviews special use applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9469)|
| 2:37:58| Amendment to Section 1.4J confirms that the downtown design review guidelines apply to properties in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9478)|
| 2:38:06| In the new zoning code, they're slightly different nomenclature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9486)|
| 2:38:10| I think with the revisions, I'll look to Mr. Reynolds here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9490)|
| 2:38:14| the revisions to the design review guidelines that were approved on consent may have addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9494)|
| 2:38:20| Even so, this just clarifies that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| Section 4.1.A confirms that the EN district designation can be applied to any neighborhood as directed by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9504)|
| 2:38:35| This removes the distinction that they're large lot neighborhoods, low-density large lot neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9515)|
| 2:38:42| This is instigated by comments at city council hearings on the new zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9522)|
| 2:38:48| where residents of older neighborhoods, small lot, said their neighborhoods were established, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9528)|
| 2:38:54| and they wanted the option if ever so desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9534)|
| 2:38:59| Section 8.2.A, this is a follow-up, maybe the one that Ms. Feld has joined us for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9539)|
| 2:39:08| There was some discussion about institutional zoning districts and the sign application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9548)|
| 2:39:14| and the application of that district has been to areas, not lots, areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9554)|
| 2:39:21| If anyone can't identify the difference between an area and a lot, they need to get a dictionary and some common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9561)|
| 2:39:33| Sorry, I'm being honest in my short tenure that remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| I'll get my dictionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9576)|
| 2:39:37| It's to provide direction to both this commission and city council that the institutional zone should be applied to areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9577)|
| 2:39:46| which could be composed of many lots that are a minimum of five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9586)|
| 2:39:51| The only question I have for you there is should the word be should or shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9591)|
| 2:39:56| Typically, in those purpose sections, they're not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9596)|
| 2:40:02| Staff would recommend that it say should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9602)|
| 2:40:05| That provides a good direction for this commission and the council on the application of a zoning district to several lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9605)|
| 2:40:12| that that area encompassed by that zoning district be a minimum of five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9612)|
| 2:40:18| Section 13.9.F clarifies that the identified sign standards apply in the commercial, industrial, and institutional districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9618)|
| 2:40:30| The revision was made in the draft in the heading, but it didn't follow through in the subheadings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| Section 14.12.A and B assigns a full administration of the downtown design review to the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9636)|
| 2:40:45| and adds a citizen member to the design review board to replace the city staff appointment that was eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9645)|
| 2:40:51| The final one is section 16.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| Well, there is one B there that we delete and between design and review board, so it's just design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9656)|
| 2:41:04| The final one is section 16.5.C that states what the design guidelines say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9664)|
| 2:41:13| that the design review board can grant waivers to the design guidelines, and that's been the standard practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9673)|
| 2:41:20| and we just wanted to clarify that in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| Happy to answer any questions the commission may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9683)|
| 2:41:26| I do have a question with regards to the E.N. zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9686)|
| 2:41:34| Did I hear you say that there is no longer any lot size requirements for E.N.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9694)|
| 2:41:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| Is that taken out of the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9703)|
| 2:41:46| This would take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| The E.N., the districts are unique to each area to which they're applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9708)|
| 2:41:54| For example, in Holston Hills, they could have a one-acre or ten-acre minimum lot size if they wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9714)|
| 2:42:02| where if a section of Park Ridge opted for E.N., they would have a separate E.N. district that may be E.N. P.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9722)|
| 2:42:11| or P.R. for Park Ridge that would be crafted to identify the distinct characteristics of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9731)|
| 2:42:19| It's not one district that covers all or one set of standards that covers all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9739)|
| 2:42:24| Who comes up with the minimum lot size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9744)|
| 2:42:29| Is that something the council does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| The neighborhood working with staff as we craft the zoning standards in the district for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9751)|
| 2:42:37| So it would be a new district that is created by planning staff and approved by planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9757)|
| 2:42:44| And on to city council recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| And working with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9771)|
| 2:42:52| Ms. Feld, you've sat through a very long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9772)|
| 2:42:55| Did you have anything that you want to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9775)|
| 2:43:03| Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9783)|
| 2:43:08| Thank you for giving me a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9788)|
| 2:43:10| It's not as long as the November meeting I sat through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9790)|
| 2:43:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| I hope you've all had an opportunity to read Carlene Malone's letter that she sent to the commissioners about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9796)|
| 2:43:25| What I'm going to speak to is the recommended five acres for an institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9805)|
| 2:43:35| And I'm going to piggyback on to her letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| We are still confused about this because, again, the language that the planning commission is recommending is should and not shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9819)|
| 2:43:50| And in table 8.2, directly underneath the purpose statement, it says that the minimum requirement for an institutional zone is 20,000 square feet, which is half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9830)|
| 2:44:04| So while at the risk of incurring Mr. Green's wrath about this or ire, we don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9844)|
| 2:44:14| I'm sorry. We don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| The guideline, or we understand that you might want institutional zones to be five acres, but the fact is that the minimum lot size allowed or area allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9856)|
| 2:44:29| whatever you want to call it, is 20,000 square feet, according to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9869)|
| 2:44:34| And I understand that my ire was not directed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9874)|
| 2:44:37| It's built up over 40 years of being in the profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9877)|
| 2:44:43| That's pretty minor for after 40 years, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| Think of it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| In your neighborhood in Sequoia Hills, Sequoia Hills is an area that encompasses 100 acres, maybe more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9889)|
| 2:44:57| But the minimum lot size is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| I don't think the planning staff would not recommend, nor I hope the planning commission would not recommend onto city council and then city council approve an R-N-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9901)|
| 2:45:14| Let's say we take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9914)|
| 2:45:16| That's R-N-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| So an R-N-1 zone in the middle of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9918)|
| 2:45:23| That's 7,000 or 10,000 square feet because that's the minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9923)|
| 2:45:28| We look at areas, and, in fact, spot zoning is often defined as applying a zoning to an area or a property that's less than an acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9928)|
| 2:45:39| varies from two acres to, I've seen court cases where it goes up to 10 acres, where you apply that zone to an area less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9939)|
| 2:45:50| The lot size within a zone district is different from the zone district itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9950)|
| 2:45:56| And the area to which the zone district is applied is that larger area composed of several lots that have to meet the minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9956)|
| 2:46:04| Using the institutional zoning as an example, the Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center in Fort Sanders is 20-plus acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9964)|
| 2:46:17| but the minimum lot size is 20,000 square feet because there are lots within that zoning area that are 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9977)|
| 2:46:25| that encompass the smaller offices around the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| And that's trying to describe the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| And I do get frustrated at times, but I never get mad at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=9994)|
| 2:46:41| Sometimes I call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10001)|
| 2:46:42| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| You should all know, from my view, I have a good relationship with Dr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10004)|
| 2:46:51| But I guess I'm just a simple person, and I'm not a planner, and I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10011)|
| 2:46:59| But, again, I still come back to should and you say I hope that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10019)|
| 2:47:05| But when you all are gone, and, unfortunately, I'm sad to hear that you're going to be leaving us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10025)|
| 2:47:12| I really am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| But other commissioners and directors might not interpret it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10033)|
| 2:47:22| You know, I think they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10042)|
| 2:47:25| It kind of boils down to common sense, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10045)|
| 2:47:28| And I'm pretty sure they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10048)|
| 2:47:31| I'll say this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10051)|
| 2:47:32| I don't live in the realm of doom and gloom that Ms. Malone often comes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10052)|
| 2:47:38| because I have more faith in this commission and my successors and my staff to understand and interpret this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10058)|
| 2:47:44| And if they don't, I have a great deal of faith in you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10064)|
| 2:47:47| and especially Ms. Malone, to come in and let them know how they should deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| And I think the bigger question is whether in the wording it should be should or shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10071)|
| 2:48:00| and that's a question that I've raised to the commission, and that's their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10080)|
| 2:48:06| And if it changes, excuse me, but if they decide to change it to shall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10086)|
| 2:48:11| wouldn't that also require a change in Table 8.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10091)|
| 2:48:17| No, because, again, it's the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| It's not the minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| And we certainly don't want to establish a five-acre minimum lot size in the institutional zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10101)|
| 2:48:27| because that would create a number of nonconformities throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| and make it very difficult, for example, for a new hospital to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10111)|
| 2:48:35| and have those I parcels where a primary care physician or a pharmacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10115)|
| 2:48:43| or an orthopedic clinic could be located because they are not going to buy a five-acre minimum lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10123)|
| 2:48:50| to do a pharmacy or a small office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| Can that be clarified in the language of the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10132)|
| 2:48:57| So what I'm hearing you say, I would advocate for shall and not should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10137)|
| 2:49:03| and can you not have a sentence that clarifies that based on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10143)|
| 2:49:09| that individual lots within the institutional zone can be 20,000 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10149)|
| 2:49:15| I think if the commission so directs, I can do that as a revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10155)|
| 2:49:20| I'd like to get this on to City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| but I'd certainly be willing to craft that language before it goes to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10162)|
| 2:49:27| and have that recommendation from this commission include that sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10167)|
| 2:49:31| that the area is composed of maybe composed of many lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10171)|
| 2:49:36| with a minimum lot size of about 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10176)|
| 2:49:41| That would make me happier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10181)|
| 2:49:44| It would make me happy just to try to move a few things off my plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10184)|
| 2:49:47| although I'm starting to do, I think, that maybe deferring everything to Hologos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10187)|
| 2:49:51| would be, as recommended by Commissioner Smith, would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10191)|
| 2:49:57| So right now, Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10197)|
| 2:50:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10201)|
| 2:50:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10202)|
| 2:50:03| Commissioner Clancy, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| I'd like to make a motion that the approval of the draft ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| making minor revisions to the new city of Knoxville zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10208)|
| 2:50:15| with the inclusion of correcting the semantics that we have discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10215)|
| 2:50:20| be sent on to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10220)|
| 2:50:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10223)|
| 2:50:24| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10224)|
| 2:50:25| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10225)|
| 2:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10226)|
| 2:50:27| We had a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| Did anyone have any comments or thoughts on this area zone institutional should or shall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10230)|
| 2:50:36| Are we good with should?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10239)|
| 2:50:40| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10240)|
| 2:50:41| Does this give you the time to get it to Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10244)|
| 2:50:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10246)|
| 2:50:48| Did anyone have any comments on that should, shall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10248)|
| 2:50:53| As per recommended, shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| We'll take its place based on what Mr. Green thinks is the best language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10255)|
| 2:51:02| We'll go with shall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10262)|
| 2:51:03| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10265)|
| 2:51:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10268)|
| 2:51:09| I see no further lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10271)|
| 2:51:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10273)|
| 2:51:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| And we have one final thing on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10276)|
| 2:51:21| which is the appointment of calendar year 2020 executive committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| The staff recommendation is to allow me to appoint the committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10287)|
| 2:51:32| and I have no objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| I want to thank those that have served on the executive committee over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10295)|
| 2:51:40| I have not yet confirmed with each of them that they would like to remain on the executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10300)|
| 2:51:46| I will do that soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10306)|
| 2:51:49| And we will have an executive committee before our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| Do I hear a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10316)|
| 2:51:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10317)|
| 2:52:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200109?start=10325)|
