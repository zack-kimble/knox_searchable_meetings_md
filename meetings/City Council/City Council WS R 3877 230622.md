|     221 |   225 | that as time passes with a unique form-based district                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=221.0)  |
|     225 |   230 | that we do our best to look for tweaks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=225.0)  |
|     230 |   233 | And so I think what you'll hear tonight                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=230.0)  |
|     233 |   234 | is some recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=233.0)  |
|     234 |   239 | about what those surgical adjustments need to be,                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=234.0)  |
|     239 |   241 | and there's always room for improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=239.0)  |
|     241 |   244 | So that bit of context, I think, is important,                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=241.0)  |
|     244 |   249 | just to know this vision plan stems 15-plus years,                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=244.0)  |
|     249 |   252 | and it's important from time to time                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=249.0)  |
|     252 |   255 | to evaluate what's gone well and what hasn't,                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=252.0)  |
|     255 |   258 | and there's plenty of, I don't remember the percentage,                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=255.0)  |
|     258 |   260 | but at the South Knoxville Open House,                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=258.0)  |
|     260 |   262 | there was a lot of interest in all the development that's happened,                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=260.0)  |
|     262 |   266 | but it's still, I think, less than half of the properties                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=262.0)  |
|     266 |   270 | that were empty or blighted have been redevelopment,                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=266.0)  |
|     270 |   271 | so there's still a long way to go                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=270.0)  |
|     271 |   275 | before the vision is realized, if it's ever realized,                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=271.0)  |
|     275 |   279 | but we keep making good impact and making good progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=275.0)  |
|     279 |   281 | It's important that we be reflective as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=279.0)  |
|     281 |   284 | So that's all the context I would add for this,                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=281.0)  |

|     328 |   332 | but Knoxville is lucky in that we have two form-based districts                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=328.0)  |

|     885 |   891 | I do just want to thank both Councilman Smith and the advisory group.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=885.0)  |
|     891 |   897 | This group of citizens, they're unpaid, spent several hours of their time,                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=891.0)  |

|     899 |   906 | and that group is, one, they're very knowledgeable as residents of the district,                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=899.0)  |
|     906 |   911 | and they have done a great job of helping us see the perspective of a resident                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=906.0)  |
|     911 |   914 | through different districts, as well as business owners,                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=911.0)  |
|     914 |   916 | and they've also pushed us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=914.0)  |
|     916 |   919 | We get sometimes into our zone and get busy,                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=916.0)  |
|     919 |   922 | and so the group has done a really good job of pushing us.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=919.0)  |
|     922 |   926 | So you can see the group, and then I think Ms. Toker's going to come up,                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=922.0)  |
|     926 |   928 | but, again, Councilmember Tommy Smith, who's been a big advocate                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=926.0)  |

|    1169 |  1173 | At each meeting, community members identified areas to discuss,                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1169.0) |

|    1187 |  1192 | We appreciate council's time spent in this workshop to further discuss form-based code,                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1187.0) |
|    1192 |  1199 | and we hope council will soon be able to vote on the advisory group recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1192.0) |

|    1208 |  1209 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1208.0) |
|    1209 |  1211 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1209.0) |
|    1211 |  1217 | So one of the concerns that brought the advisory group together was the number of variances                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1211.0) |
|    1217 |  1220 | that have occurred in the South Waterfront area.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1217.0) |
|    1220 |  1226 | Since 2019, there have been over 24 variances approved in the South Waterfront area.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1220.0) |
|    1226 |  1231 | The QR code that you see there, if you scan that, it will take you to a concept board                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1226.0) |
|    1231 |  1238 | so you can see visually where these variances occurred, what their applications were for,                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1231.0) |
|    1238 |  1241 | as well as whether or not they were approved or denied.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1238.0) |
|    1241 |  1247 | So, again, 24 were approved and only three were denied,                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1241.0) |
|    1247 |  1255 | which is quite a number of variances for a smaller district in a four-and-a-half-year time period.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1247.0) |
|    1255 |  1265 | And the most common variance types that we had were related to setbacks, building heights,                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1255.0) |
|    1265 |  1267 | as well as parking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1265.0) |
|    1267 |  1271 | The South Waterfront area only has a maximum parking standard.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1267.0) |
|    1271 |  1275 | There is no minimum parking standard like there is in other parts of the city.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1271.0) |
|    1275 |  1281 | So folks have asked for increases to the maximum parking standards in that district,                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1275.0) |
|    1281 |  1284 | as well as ground floor transparency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1281.0) |
|    1285 |  1290 | And we'll go into that in a little bit more detail related to the recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1285.0) |
|    1292 |  1299 | So there are two recommendations that we are recommending at this time.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1292.0) |
|    1299 |  1304 | We do have another meeting and some additional discussions to have,                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1299.0) |
|    1304 |  1307 | but the first one is related to transparency.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1304.0) |
|    1307 |  1313 | So in the more commercial form-based districts in the South Waterfront area,                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1307.0) |
|    1313 |  1322 | there's a requirement that 70 percent of the ground floor area adjacent to the street frontage be 70 percent transparent.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1313.0) |
|    1322 |  1336 | This group is recommending that a cap be inserted that limits the ability to grant variances on this standard.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1322.0) |
|    1336 |  1354 | So there would be no more than 60 percent transparency at the least in the South Waterfront districts if this revision were to be adopted.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1336.0) |
|    1354 |  1361 | So this would ensure that those spaces continue to be developed in a way that in the future,                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1354.0) |
|    1361 |  1366 | while they might currently be developed as residential now,                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1361.0) |
|    1366 |  1376 | that in the future built out in a way that could easily be converted to commercial once the market is there for that.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1366.0) |
|    1376 |  1379 | And then because we had a number of discussions about parking,                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1376.0) |
|    1379 |  1384 | we looked at what the standards were in the code currently and saw that they were pretty limited,                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1379.0) |
|    1384 |  1388 | especially when it came to surface parking lots.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1384.0) |
|    1388 |  1395 | And there really weren't explicit provisions related to stand-alone surface parking lots in the South Waterfront district.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1388.0) |
|    1395 |  1403 | So we are making recommendations for standards to be added to the code.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1395.0) |
|    1403 |  1408 | And in reference to the transparency standards,                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1403.0) |
|    1408 |  1415 | these are two examples of buildings that have met the transparency standards without variances in the South Waterfront.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1408.0) |
|    1415 |  1424 | That includes One River Walk on Blunt Avenue and City South on Sevier Avenue.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1415.0) |
|    1424 |  1433 | And these are standards that we're recommending for the stand-alone surface parking lots.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1424.0) |
|    1433 |  1442 | So right now there would have to, if these provisions were to be recommended for adoption and were inserted into the code,                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1433.0) |
|    1443 |  1450 | there would have to be a minimum interior and rear setback of five feet for these stand-alone surface parking lots.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1443.0) |
|    1450 |  1457 | We would also note that there could not be a variance permitted for that standard.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1450.0) |
|    1457 |  1462 | So it would always have to be five feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1457.0) |
|    1462 |  1468 | Headlight screening would also be required for these type of parking lots with either a fence or a wall,                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1462.0) |
|    1468 |  1471 | and it would have to be a minimum of 42 inches high.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1468.0) |
|    1471 |  1481 | And there would have to be vegetation planted on the side of the fence or wall adjacent to the adjacent property                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1471.0) |
|    1481 |  1487 | to help soften the way that that looks for the adjacent properties.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1481.0) |
|    1487 |  1493 | And interior parking lot landscaping would be required for these parking lots,                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1487.0) |
|    1493 |  1498 | and that would start at parking areas that are 5,000 square feet or more.                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1493.0) |
|    1498 |  1501 | So really that would be about 10 parking spaces.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1498.0) |
|    1501 |  1507 | So if you were going to build a stand-alone parking lot of 10 spaces plus the drive aisles,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1501.0) |
|    1507 |  1514 | you would have to likely provide this interior parking lot landscaping as well.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1507.0) |
|    1514 |  1517 | And these are the standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1514.0) |
|    1517 |  1522 | So for every five parking spaces, one parking lot island would have to be provided,                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1517.0) |
|    1522 |  1525 | and that island would have to be planted with a shade tree,                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1522.0) |
|    1525 |  1532 | and then it would have to have a minimum 60 percent planted area within that island.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1525.0) |
|    1532 |  1539 | And these island sizes are the same that we have currently in the rest of the zoning ordinance,                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1532.0) |
|    1539 |  1547 | but those standards are not required for interior parking lot landscaping unless you hit 20,000 square feet.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1539.0) |
|    1547 |  1549 | I think you all have discussed this recently.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1547.0) |
|    1549 |  1554 | So just to clarify, these are specific to the south waterfront area,                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1549.0) |
|    1554 |  1561 | not to all of the rest of the city's own districts.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1554.0) |
|    1561 |  1563 | And then while we were going through the ordinance,                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1561.0) |
|    1563 |  1570 | we noticed several places that reference old articles and old sections of the zoning ordinance.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1563.0) |
|    1570 |  1574 | So those are really just house cleaning things that need to be clarified                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1570.0) |
|    1574 |  1578 | and point to the correct sections of code that we have now.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1574.0) |
|    1579 |  1584 | They just were not updated, you know, during recode.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1579.0) |
|    1584 |  1590 | So we're recommending to correct that as part of this.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1584.0) |
|    1590 |  1598 | And we have some next steps, including the advisory group meeting on July 25th,                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1590.0) |
|    1598 |  1606 | where we will review again in detail the Level 2 and Level 3 review process                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1598.0) |
|    1606 |  1615 | and also the idea about possibly requiring ground floor commercial within the south waterfront districts,                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1606.0) |
|    1615 |  1619 | which is another thing the advisory group is interested in.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1615.0) |
|    1619 |  1621 | And again, I mentioned this earlier,                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1619.0) |
|    1621 |  1626 | but these revisions could potentially be to planning commission by their August 10th meeting,                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1621.0) |
|    1626 |  1630 | and then they would come before this body by September                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1626.0) |
|    1630 |  1637 | and could potentially be part of the code by September 19th.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1630.0) |
|    1637 |  1640 | Vice Mayor, I just had one other item that wasn't on the screen.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1637.0) |
|    1640 |  1643 | It was outside the scope of really the work we were doing,                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1640.0) |
|    1643 |  1648 | but members of the committee felt it was important to consider,                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1643.0) |

|    1652 |  1658 | perhaps a neighborhood leader developer academy where we could help educate                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1652.0) |
|    1658 |  1661 | and connect the development community to neighborhood advocates,                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1658.0) |
|    1661 |  1669 | but also help educate an expert in each neighborhood that could understand where the information is on the website,                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1661.0) |

|    1674 |  1679 | She is now leading the charge, working with Ms. Sharp to look at doing that,                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1674.0) |
|    1679 |  1682 | which I think would also be helpful because the process is complicated.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1679.0) |
|    1682 |  1684 | It's confusing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1682.0) |

|    1686 |  1691 | that's how we make it as easy as possible to gather information and to connect with the right staff.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1686.0) |
|    1691 |  1694 | So that's not on the screen, but that is something that Ms. Albertson is looking at.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1691.0) |

|    1697 |  1699 | It's time for council questions and discussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1697.0) |
|    1699 |  1705 | I saw Ms. Parker's light go on first, so Council Member Parker.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1699.0) |
|    1705 |  1709 | Thank you, Vice Mayor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1705.0) |
|    1709 |  1724 | As the advisory group has been focused primarily on the administrative review process,                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1709.0) |
|    1724 |  1737 | but I wondered if there was any discussion of how form-based codes districts are defined in general                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1724.0) |
|    1737 |  1744 | and the level of discretion that's been granted in determining what's an appropriate development                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1737.0) |
|    1744 |  1748 | and not having as many constraints as the conventional zoning.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1744.0) |
|    1748 |  1750 | Was that discussed at all?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1748.0) |
|    1750 |  1751 | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1750.0) |
|    1751 |  1755 | I would say that we discussed a lot, especially at the first meeting,                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1751.0) |
|    1755 |  1760 | just how these form-based zone districts are different                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1755.0) |
|    1760 |  1768 | in that they really do hearken back to the vision plan multiple times throughout the regulating plan,                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1760.0) |
|    1768 |  1772 | which is the zoning ordinance language,                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1768.0) |
|    1772 |  1781 | but that we're also limited as far as staff and design professionals to what's actually in the code.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1772.0) |
|    1781 |  1789 | So, you know, there's not a lot of leeway generally to refer back to the plan                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1781.0) |
|    1789 |  1798 | because the zone districts themselves are the regulating plan, if that makes sense.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1789.0) |
|    1798 |  1810 | Well, I'm curious if you can elaborate on the limited staffing you were talking about and what your design is.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1798.0) |
|    1810 |  1813 | It's hard to review because of limited design staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1810.0) |

|    1815 |  1825 | So that is really like that staff has to have an explicit standard to refer to with enforcement,                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1815.0) |
|    1825 |  1832 | and design professionals and folks that are wanting to build within districts need to have something that's very explicit                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1825.0) |
|    1832 |  1835 | that they can say this is the standard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1832.0) |
|    1835 |  1843 | So, you know, it really needs to be part of the code explicitly to be able to enforce it                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1835.0) |
|    1843 |  1846 | as part of a zone district, even within the form-based zone districts.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1843.0) |
|    1846 |  1849 | So there, you know, is a vision and intent.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1846.0) |
|    1849 |  1858 | For instance, you know, the vision and intent in some of the districts say that commercial uses are not permitted.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1849.0) |
|    1858 |  1866 | And in some of the vision intent areas, it says that commercial uses and residential uses are permitted.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1858.0) |
|    1866 |  1871 | So that vision and intent section is pretty explicit.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1866.0) |
|    1872 |  1881 | And so, you know, that is what staff uses in terms of deciding what the permitted uses are,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1872.0) |
|    1881 |  1887 | because there's really only a list of prohibited uses as well in the code.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1881.0) |
|    1887 |  1893 | But you need specific standards to be able to implement the ordinance.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1887.0) |
|    1893 |  1900 | Are there any recommendations for there to be a follow-up process to explore that further?                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1893.0) |
|    1900 |  1903 | More specifics in the code?                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1900.0) |
|    1903 |  1904 | I'm sorry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1903.0) |
|    1904 |  1905 | Could you repeat that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1904.0) |
|    1905 |  1906 | I couldn't quite hear it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1905.0) |
|    1906 |  1919 | Was there any discussion or recommendations made for a follow-up process that could look into that more fully to identify more specifics?                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1906.0) |
|    1919 |  1927 | Well, we are going to go into Level 2 and Level 3 review at our January 25th meeting, which ‑‑                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1919.0) |
|    1927 |  1929 | July.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1927.0) |
|    1930 |  1932 | Yeah, July.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1930.0) |
|    1932 |  1937 | Which could be a time for us to really address more of those.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1932.0) |
|    1937 |  1944 | Councilwoman Parker, I think one of the issues that had arisen was the Level 2, Level 3, and how that decision is made.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1937.0) |
|    1944 |  1951 | And in the language, I think we all agree, you know, it can be a little gray.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1944.0) |
|    1951 |  1953 | And so that's what we're going to dig into next.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1951.0) |
|    1953 |  1960 | And that is where there has been some discussion about discretion on that what goes to Level 3, what does not go to Level 3.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1953.0) |
|    1960 |  1964 | And, you know, it's interesting how, you know, group dynamics, we kind of went into it with that,                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1960.0) |
|    1964 |  1968 | but then we jumped into transparency and parking, and we're committed to that.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1964.0) |
|    1968 |  1970 | But that's going to take a little bit more time.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1968.0) |
|    1970 |  1974 | And so I think July and August, we're really going to dig in on that.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1970.0) |
|    1974 |  1978 | And typically how this has worked is the committees come together, had really good dialogue.                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1974.0) |
|    1978 |  1984 | Ms. Albertson, Ms. McGrawns, and others take that information and then go sit with other lawyers,                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1978.0) |
|    1984 |  1987 | look at what kind of language could be tweaked in the code.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1984.0) |
|    1987 |  1992 | Then the next meeting we come back with a draft, and we let the committee and advisory group begin.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1987.0) |
|    1992 |  1994 | We start to chew on it again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1992.0) |
|    1994 |  1998 | But I think that will probably get the concern that you're raising about the discretion.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1994.0) |
|    1998 |  2001 | But I think we all felt like the vision was really, really good.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=1998.0) |
|    2001 |  2005 | And I think Councilman Smith has said this routinely, we need to honor the vision.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2001.0) |
|    2005 |  2007 | There's a lot of process that went into that.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2005.0) |
|    2007 |  2012 | And the process works well, but how do we, for both the community and for Mr. Ahrens,                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2007.0) |
|    2012 |  2017 | how do we make sure that language is really clear, especially level one, or excuse me, two and three?                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2012.0) |
|    2017 |  2018 | Did that answer your question?                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2017.0) |
|    2018 |  2020 | Yeah, it did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2018.0) |
|    2020 |  2027 | My last comment was just that I realize this process is underway,                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2020.0) |
|    2028 |  2038 | but I would strongly encourage the addition of representation on the advisory group from Phillips Avenue,                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2028.0) |
|    2038 |  2042 | because those are residents I've heard a lot from,                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2038.0) |
|    2042 |  2047 | and I'm glad to see a Scottish Pike resident as a part of the group,                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2042.0) |
|    2047 |  2053 | but that's just one resident from the South Waterfront out of the 11 voices.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2047.0) |
|    2053 |  2056 | So that was just one concern I wanted to lift up.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2053.0) |
|    2056 |  2057 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2056.0) |

|    2060 |  2066 | One of the things I think, Councilman Parker, you brought up or alluded to maybe was that I always refer to is                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2060.0) |
|    2066 |  2074 | the flexibility of the form-based code inherently is going to bring some point of friction based on interpretation.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2066.0) |
|    2074 |  2075 | So it's flexible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2074.0) |
|    2075 |  2076 | It should be more efficient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2075.0) |
|    2076 |  2077 | It should be more flexible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2076.0) |
|    2077 |  2079 | But it's going to come down to somebody's judgment,                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2077.0) |
|    2079 |  2082 | and there's going to be some scenario that wasn't foreseen.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2079.0) |
|    2082 |  2094 | And so part of the reason for the Level 2, Level 3 clarity is to give staff a little bit more words to work with                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2082.0) |
|    2094 |  2098 | so that they're not accused of over-influencing or under-influencing.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2094.0) |
|    2098 |  2104 | And so I think that you bring up a good point, and I think it's just going to be an inherent challenge.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2098.0) |
|    2104 |  2109 | The other thing that I think is really important that I always say for the South Waterfront particularly is                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2104.0) |
|    2109 |  2118 | the standards we have set up for the South Waterfront are a decade or more ahead of our culture in the overall citywide.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2109.0) |
|    2118 |  2121 | And so it calls for no minimum of parking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2118.0) |
|    2121 |  2123 | Well, people still really want to park close.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2121.0) |
|    2123 |  2128 | It will be another 10 or 20 years maybe before the average person, some of us may be okay with it,                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2123.0) |
|    2128 |  2130 | but the average person walking further.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2128.0) |
|    2130 |  2134 | So there's this horizon between where we are now.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2130.0) |
|    2134 |  2136 | The code is way out here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2134.0) |
|    2136 |  2143 | There's just going to be kind of change friction of the culture kind of growing into the code, if you will.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2136.0) |
|    2143 |  2148 | So I think that's an important thing that I've always kind of thought a little bit about,                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2143.0) |
|    2148 |  2154 | and it's just going to be important for specificity to avoid some of that.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2148.0) |
|    2154 |  2156 | Mr. Kadat, can I ask you to come up?                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2154.0) |
|    2156 |  2157 | This is a surprise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2156.0) |
|    2157 |  2164 | I'm not going to sing to you or wish you happy birthday, but I have a question that I think you can answer pretty well.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2157.0) |
|    2164 |  2169 | Most of the development, as we're all aware, along the South Waterfront has been largely on the east side,                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2164.0) |
|    2169 |  2171 | and so along Sevier Avenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2169.0) |
|    2171 |  2175 | So that's where the bulk of the development has happened, and so not so much on the west side.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2171.0) |
|    2175 |  2182 | And so that's where Mr. Kadat lives, and he's one of three people on the advisory group                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2175.0) |

|    2213 |  2218 | Well, I know in our community, so the Southside Waterfront, which is our neighborhood,                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2213.0) |
|    2218 |  2220 | can you guys hear me all right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2218.0) |
|    2220 |  2222 | And then the Vestal neighborhood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2220.0) |
|    2222 |  2223 | So we talk a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2222.0) |
|    2223 |  2226 | We interact a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2223.0) |
|    2226 |  2231 | And it's kind of a community consensus that having the ground floor transparency,                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2226.0) |
|    2231 |  2236 | one of the reasons for it is walkability, so you're not just looking at a brick wall.                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2231.0) |
|    2236 |  2242 | But also one of the things that we're really concerned about is having the ground floor commercial retail                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2236.0) |
|    2242 |  2247 | so that people who live over here have someplace to go to to kind of encourage that walkable community.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2242.0) |
|    2247 |  2251 | So you have reason to walk somewhere, not just, you know, to walk your dog.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2247.0) |
|    2251 |  2255 | And it could also bring people from different parts of the community there.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2251.0) |
|    2255 |  2260 | We'd really love to see more commercial hubs, or not commercial hubs, but community hubs,                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2255.0) |
|    2260 |  2262 | and uniting those community hubs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2260.0) |
|    2262 |  2263 | Is that answering your question?                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2262.0) |

|    2266 |  2267 | Yeah, thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2266.0) |
|    2267 |  2274 | I think John's just been really good to communicate what he desires on the west side of Chapman Highway                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2267.0) |
|    2274 |  2279 | that has kind of evolved on Sevier Avenue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2274.0) |
|    2279 |  2286 | And the transparency item in here is adding some more rigidity to the form-based code,                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2279.0) |
|    2286 |  2290 | specifically requiring no variance over 10%.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2286.0) |
|    2290 |  2293 | I think, did I get the language right?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2290.0) |
|    2293 |  2296 | And again, that's based on variances that have come up.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2293.0) |
|    2296 |  2304 | But at the heart of it, back to the vision plan, and partly what you just said is the desire to sleep,                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2296.0) |
|    2304 |  2308 | play, transact, buy, and kind of make it a little village.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2304.0) |
|    2308 |  2316 | So if there's no businesses along that corridor to walk to, we may fail.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2308.0) |
|    2316 |  2318 | So thank you for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2316.0) |
|    2318 |  2323 | I have some other questions, but I'll let some council members ask some questions.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2318.0) |

|    2324 |  2329 | And I just wanted to jump in, and I think Mr. Cadat mentioned this,                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2324.0) |
|    2329 |  2335 | but I think all of us that, you know, have mics know what transparency means.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2329.0) |
|    2335 |  2338 | But I'm not sure that everyone in the audience or maybe those watching at home                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2335.0) |
|    2338 |  2340 | or who might watch this in the future know what that means.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2338.0) |
|    2340 |  2345 | So, Ms. Albertson, could you maybe talk to us about transparency?                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2340.0) |
|    2345 |  2347 | I know we see the pictures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2345.0) |
|    2347 |  2352 | I know what it means, but I don't know, could you explain it so everyone understands what we're talking about?                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2347.0) |
|    2352 |  2354 | I'll try my best.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2352.0) |
|    2354 |  2365 | So generally ground floor transparency is considered the first ten feet up from where the building meets the street or the sidewalk.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2354.0) |
|    2365 |  2371 | So the first ten feet up would be the ground floor where you would measure transparency.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2365.0) |
|    2371 |  2379 | So these would be, transparency would be windows, it could be doors, you know,                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2371.0) |
|    2379 |  2386 | some other sort of feature that you can see through that is clear, that is transparent.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2379.0) |
|    2386 |  2395 | So here in One River Walk, you can see they have a mixture of doors and windows in that area,                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2386.0) |
|    2395 |  2402 | and then very minimal separation with just facade materials like bricks or other things.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2395.0) |
|    2402 |  2406 | So the majority of the ground floor is transparent.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2402.0) |
|    2406 |  2408 | You can see through it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2406.0) |
|    2408 |  2412 | So I think the goal of transparency is all about the individual walking or biking.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2408.0) |
|    2412 |  2416 | So, you know, and the planer idea is no blank walls,                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2412.0) |
|    2416 |  2419 | and I think a lot of urban spaces had blank walls for decades,                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2416.0) |
|    2419 |  2423 | or maybe a garage was built or a building with a big concrete wall,                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2419.0) |
|    2423 |  2426 | and that's not inviting, it's not always safe,                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2423.0) |
|    2426 |  2433 | and so having windows, having light and transparency are really priorities within the South Waterfront,                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2426.0) |
|    2433 |  2437 | and that was one of the reasons we dug in on that item pretty quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2433.0) |
|    2437 |  2444 | I do want to say that the LIV project at 451 that I think helped spur getting this resolution and our work,                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2437.0) |
|    2444 |  2448 | Rebecca Jane Justice and others, you know, we heard the consternation.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2444.0) |
|    2448 |  2454 | Councilman Smith specifically asked us to get directly with them, even though they received those variances,                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2448.0) |
|    2454 |  2462 | and so RJ has done that, and on Building 100, I believe the transparency is about 60% now,                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2454.0) |
|    2462 |  2466 | and they could have gone down to almost 30-some-odd percent.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2462.0) |
|    2466 |  2468 | So we're really close on the transparency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2466.0) |
|    2468 |  2475 | They're going to put a coffee shop in on one corner, and then the other building, I believe it's 200, is at 58%.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2468.0) |
|    2475 |  2478 | So I do want to say that we heard that loud and clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2475.0) |
|    2478 |  2479 | There were community concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2478.0) |
|    2479 |  2483 | Councilman Smith asked us to get with them, and we've been pushing them,                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2479.0) |
|    2483 |  2489 | and so I feel like it's not perfect, but I think we've tried to meet in the middle quite a bit on that experience,                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2483.0) |
|    2489 |  2494 | and we can send council some renderings in the community, some of the latest renderings on that if that helps.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2489.0) |
|    2494 |  2497 | And if I may, if you'll excuse me for 30 more seconds,                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2494.0) |
|    2497 |  2503 | I think the importance of the transparency on the ground floor is that maybe not even now that a business goes in there,                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2497.0) |
|    2503 |  2507 | but if there's enough density that gets built up along the South Waterfront,                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2503.0) |
|    2507 |  2510 | an owner of a building may down the road see that that's more profitable                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2507.0) |
|    2510 |  2514 | and then kind of flip the bottom into a business, which is, again,                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2510.0) |
|    2514 |  2519 | reinforces that connectivity and pedestrian shopping, et cetera.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2514.0) |

|    2526 |  2528 | I was pushing my button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2526.0) |
|    2528 |  2543 | So, Ms. Albertson, so the next steps timeline and the suggestions that you presented, the revision recommendations,                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2528.0) |
|    2543 |  2547 | is that, like, incremental at this point?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2543.0) |
|    2547 |  2553 | Like, you guys have another meeting in July, and you're going to talk about some other parts of the code.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2547.0) |
|    2553 |  2561 | So right now what you've presented to us in terms of proposed revisions timeline, the August, the September,                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2553.0) |
|    2561 |  2564 | that's for what we saw tonight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2561.0) |
|    2564 |  2568 | You may have other stuff that comes at a different time.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2564.0) |

|    2569 |  2570 | Okay.

|    2570 |  2571 | I was just trying to figure out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2570.0) |

|    2573 |  2575 | Yeah, I think we've worked hard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2573.0) |

|    2578 |  2580 | The advisory committee has reviewed them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2578.0) |
|    2580 |  2586 | We're ready to push those forward and then start tackling the next two issues, which is level two, level three,                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2580.0) |
|    2586 |  2589 | and how do we encourage commercial on the first floor.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2586.0) |
|    2589 |  2595 | Those are the two topics we're going to start to get our arms around here in July and August.                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2589.0) |
|    2595 |  2596 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2595.0) |
|    2596 |  2605 | And I guess my other question is for Ms. McGraw is the advisory group recommendation from the slide about 70%                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2596.0) |
|    2605 |  2613 | required transparency on ground floor with no variance can be granted to reduce transparency more than 10%.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2605.0) |
|    2613 |  2623 | I think my question is not so much about what the working group is coming up with in South Knoxville as we don't have                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2613.0) |
|    2623 |  2632 | any other place in our zoning code that we do that where we limit the amount that a variance can be because a variance                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2623.0) |
|    2632 |  2637 | is based on the hardship of I can use more or less.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2632.0) |
|    2637 |  2642 | I can use my land, not at all, if you don't allow me this variance.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2637.0) |
|    2642 |  2645 | I just think that's an interesting way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2642.0) |
|    2645 |  2649 | I feel like there are times where we've had conversations.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2645.0) |
|    2649 |  2654 | I guess this is a hypothetical, philosophical question.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2649.0) |
|    2654 |  2663 | There have been times in the past where some of us have years more experience than others where we've talked about how                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2654.0) |
|    2663 |  2666 | sometimes a variance is too much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2663.0) |
|    2666 |  2667 | You know what I mean?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2666.0) |
|    2667 |  2677 | Like it's, let's say a lot coverage, like maybe asking for 30% versus 70% is different.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2667.0) |
|    2677 |  2685 | And I guess it's just interesting we don't limit that in other zoning codes because we have design guidelines now baked                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2677.0) |
|    2685 |  2690 | into some of our code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2685.0) |
|    2690 |  2691 | I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2690.0) |
|    2691 |  2699 | That may be something that, you know, concerns may arise in the future where we come back and we need to have further edits                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2691.0) |
|    2699 |  2702 | to our zoning code because of that specific reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2699.0) |
|    2702 |  2710 | But I do want to point out in our variance section, there is language in there that all variances must be the minimum adjustment necessary.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2702.0) |
|    2710 |  2715 | I hear loud and clear what you're saying as far as people asking sometimes for too much.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2710.0) |
|    2715 |  2716 | Maybe they get it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2715.0) |
|    2716 |  2717 | Maybe they don't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2716.0) |

|    2728 |  2732 | the minimum adjustment necessary has to be made to accommodate that hardship.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2728.0) |
|    2732 |  2738 | We also have in our variance section a statement that anything that is listed as a prohibition,                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2732.0) |
|    2738 |  2742 | that is not something that can be varied, which is why you find this particular,                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2738.0) |
|    2742 |  2746 | the language kind of phrased in this particular manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2742.0) |
|    2746 |  2747 | But I agree with you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2746.0) |
|    2747 |  2752 | You know, there are some standards design-wise throughout the code where that may be something we need to look at in the future,                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2747.0) |
|    2752 |  2754 | too, as more concerns arise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2752.0) |
|    2754 |  2755 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2754.0) |
|    2755 |  2761 | Because the first thought I had in my head when I looked at this was, have we asked legal, is that legal?                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2755.0) |
|    2761 |  2764 | Like, is that something good for us to bake into the thing?                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2761.0) |
|    2764 |  2768 | And obviously you're at the wheel or at the table with this.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2764.0) |
|    2768 |  2769 | So, yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2768.0) |
|    2769 |  2770 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2769.0) |
|    2770 |  2771 | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2770.0) |
|    2771 |  2774 | Well, anyway, it's interesting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2771.0) |

|    2777 |  2781 | I don't know if this is a question or just a thought or what.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2777.0) |
|    2782 |  2784 | So do with it as you will.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2782.0) |
|    2784 |  2787 | But someone acknowledged that you hear me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2784.0) |
|    2787 |  2796 | So one of the things I'm hearing about, about the transparency, I mean, it is vitally important to walkability.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2787.0) |
|    2796 |  2802 | We started doing that in downtown in order to get the kind of development we wanted.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2796.0) |
|    2802 |  2811 | We did TIFs and Pilots to incentivize because creating ground floor spaces when there's not the density of population yet                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2802.0) |
|    2811 |  2816 | is a financial hardship to get financing and that kind of thing.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2811.0) |
|    2816 |  2821 | So I know Councilman Smith has talked about this, and we've talked about this as a council,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2816.0) |

|    2825 |  2835 | And so I assume that as you all go into your next discussion about how to incentivize the transparency and the commercial,                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2825.0) |
|    2835 |  2844 | that will be also talked about how those tools can be used as leverage to get what we want.                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2835.0) |
|    2844 |  2849 | Because you have to have it before you can put the business in there.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2844.0) |
|    2849 |  2855 | But oftentimes it's built when there's not the demand for the business yet.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2849.0) |
|    2855 |  2861 | Yes, that is a topic, and I think our current tool is the TIF, Tax Incremental Financing.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2855.0) |
|    2861 |  2864 | But, yes, the group has discussed this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2861.0) |
|    2864 |  2871 | I mean, just to give you one example, the form-based code on Cumberland requires a specific use on the first floor.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2864.0) |
|    2871 |  2873 | It's commercial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2871.0) |
|    2873 |  2875 | There's a lot of reasons for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2873.0) |
|    2875 |  2880 | I think the density in that area, the number of units, you know, and that was brought up by the advisory group,                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2875.0) |
|    2880 |  2886 | and I think that is something that we will continue to look at as we see more residents moving to this area.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2880.0) |
|    2886 |  2888 | When does that become appropriate?                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2886.0) |
|    2888 |  2894 | I do think, and I've relayed this to Councilman Smith, something like that I think we would have to broaden the discussion to the development community                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2888.0) |
|    2894 |  2897 | and the market that's trying to get projects financed.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2894.0) |
|    2897 |  2901 | But, yes, how do we get what we want?                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2897.0) |
|    2901 |  2902 | I think Councilman Smith talked about this.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2901.0) |
|    2902 |  2904 | Transparency is one way to get it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2902.0) |
|    2904 |  2908 | Ultimately, we want coffee shops and bakeries, and we want restaurants                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2904.0) |
|    2908 |  2912 | and other neighborhoods serving retail on the first floor,                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2908.0) |
|    2912 |  2918 | and the transparency allows that to happen in the future versus having a structure that doesn't allow for it.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2912.0) |
|    2918 |  2923 | But, yes, the group has talked about that, and, yes, we will continue to work with the group and Councilman Smith on that.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2918.0) |
|    2923 |  2926 | Because I do think that's sometimes why people are asking for the variances,                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2923.0) |
|    2926 |  2936 | because they're worried that too much transparency won't let them put in what they need to put in to make the numbers work.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2926.0) |
|    2936 |  2938 | So it's the chicken and the egg.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2936.0) |
|    2938 |  2939 | It is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2938.0) |
|    2939 |  2942 | I do think right now, well, housing is such an issue, and maybe we don't have the density there yet.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2939.0) |
|    2942 |  2946 | That is a consideration for the advisory group to think about, and Councilman Smith,                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2942.0) |
|    2946 |  2953 | while we have a desperate need for housing, right now the market is driving housing to those first floors.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2946.0) |
|    2953 |  2957 | So we need to just, again, there's a balance there, but at some point, like Cumberland,                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2953.0) |
|    2957 |  2960 | I hope that we can start to drive a use, and the group wants to talk about that.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2957.0) |
|    2960 |  2961 | Oh, it'll get there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2960.0) |
|    2961 |  2964 | It's just what do you do in the meantime?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2961.0) |
|    2964 |  2969 | Sort of like Tommy said, you know, it's written for what we know we want.                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2964.0) |
|    2969 |  2971 | How do we get there?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2969.0) |
|    2971 |  2973 | So it wasn't really a question, just a suggestion.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2971.0) |
|    2973 |  2976 | I'm glad to know you're going to talk about it.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2973.0) |
|    2976 |  2977 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2976.0) |

|    2978 |  2980 | I just have two more quick comments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2978.0) |
|    2981 |  2984 | One is, I've already forgotten one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2981.0) |
|    2984 |  2990 | The second one is related to parking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2984.0) |
|    2990 |  2997 | So I just wanted to ask, Ms. Albertson, if you had anything to add to this kind of thought,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2990.0) |
|    2997 |  3003 | which is we don't want to encourage standalone parking lots all over the South Waterfront,                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=2997.0) |
|    3003 |  3007 | but the purpose of this recommendation is to make sure that if it does happen,                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3003.0) |
|    3007 |  3011 | it's the most neighbor and environmental-friendly parking lot in the city.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3007.0) |
|    3011 |  3012 | Is that fair?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3011.0) |
|    3012 |  3014 | Yes, I would agree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3012.0) |
|    3014 |  3019 | And that it needs to be a landscaped parking lot and really fit in with the district                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3014.0) |
|    3019 |  3026 | and not, you know, just be a sea of asphalt for the long term.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3019.0) |
|    3026 |  3032 | So that there is some thought to putting in surface parking, that it's not just haphazard,                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3026.0) |
|    3032 |  3036 | that there really has to be a well-designed parking space.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3032.0) |
|    3036 |  3042 | And the other thought around that was, you know, that if a standalone parking lot does happen,                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3036.0) |
|    3042 |  3049 | much like the transparency for retail on the ground floor, it may be a decade-long parking lot, right,                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3042.0) |
|    3049 |  3052 | where then the density comes enough and then you can actually redevelop that lot                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3049.0) |
|    3052 |  3055 | and to have commercial on the ground floor.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3052.0) |
|    3055 |  3058 | Oh, you were right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3055.0) |
|    3058 |  3059 | I waited long enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3058.0) |
|    3059 |  3060 | The other one will come back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3059.0) |
|    3061 |  3068 | Much like the, I think it's 13 priorities for redevelopment, it's in a perfect world we would have an asterisk,                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3061.0) |
|    3068 |  3074 | I think maybe for the south waterfront that says retail on the bottom equals some type of TIF support.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3068.0) |
|    3074 |  3084 | So the incentives are an important part of our July working session.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3074.0) |

|    3087 |  3091 | Kind of a general question for whoever may want to answer it.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3087.0) |
|    3091 |  3097 | These are the only two areas in the city, the south waterfront and Cumberland, that have the foreign base code.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3091.0) |

|    3099 |  3106 | How was that initiated and how did those two areas be chosen?                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3099.0) |
|    3106 |  3111 | I might let someone speak that sort of endured the vision plan process.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3106.0) |
|    3111 |  3113 | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3111.0) |

|    3116 |  3121 | That's why I ask it generally to the panel because I know this happened before a lot of us were.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3116.0) |

|    3123 |  3126 | There's a lot of island homers actually here, myself.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3123.0) |
|    3126 |  3130 | So let me start with south waterfront.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3126.0) |
|    3130 |  3138 | So when Mayor Haslam came into office, that was an area where there wasn't investment,                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3130.0) |
|    3138 |  3144 | and it was a classic river city industrial uses, brownfield, grayfield, on the water,                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3138.0) |
|    3144 |  3147 | which is every city in America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3144.0) |
|    3147 |  3150 | And so there was a desire to start to plan that effort out.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3147.0) |
|    3150 |  3151 | We started to have the downturn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3150.0) |
|    3151 |  3159 | It was a great time to go ahead and do planning and visioning for an area knowing that this was a significant downturn.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3151.0) |
|    3159 |  3162 | And so you start to do the planning, do the work.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3159.0) |
|    3162 |  3164 | Well, the market is not there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3162.0) |
|    3164 |  3174 | And plan for the initial infrastructure, like a sutry landing park, so that when the market turns, that you're ready for that.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3164.0) |
|    3174 |  3180 | And so the interest really started at an executive level with Mayor Haslam and with the community.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3174.0) |
|    3180 |  3188 | And for a long time, south Knoxville has felt like there haven't been resources, and that's not been a priority for the community.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3180.0) |
|    3188 |  3191 | And so I think Mayor Haslam heard that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3188.0) |
|    3191 |  3195 | He also then responded with the planning effort and that vision plan.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3191.0) |
|    3195 |  3198 | Again, Councilman Smith mentioned this to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3195.0) |
|    3198 |  3206 | We've got to honor this incredibly in-depth process that has allowed us to start to see the fruits of that process now.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3198.0) |
|    3206 |  3209 | So that was the South Waterfront.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3206.0) |
|    3209 |  3214 | When you look at Cumberland, there was the vision around transforming that commercial space.                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3209.0) |
|    3214 |  3216 | So Cumberland was seeing disinvestment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3214.0) |
|    3216 |  3219 | It was back in the 50s, 60s, and 70s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3216.0) |
|    3219 |  3222 | It was essentially a suburban portion of our community.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3219.0) |
|    3222 |  3230 | It was a suburban corridor that had very automobile-centric services, fast food, local restaurants.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3222.0) |
|    3230 |  3236 | That had started to change, and we were starting to see significant disinvestment.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3230.0) |
|    3236 |  3246 | And so with the interest in addressing land use and zoning, the Forum District was selected as the tool to help do that.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3236.0) |
|    3246 |  3254 | And I think, again, what we have seen is consolidation of parcels, many of them owned by the same kind of family for many, many, many years.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3246.0) |
|    3254 |  3260 | And so those consolidations in more vertical, more dense urban form.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3254.0) |
|    3260 |  3265 | And so that was, I believe, why that district came on board was, again, the disinvestment.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3260.0) |
|    3265 |  3274 | And, again, I think nostalgia is powerful that Cumberland was a really hot, really strong, energetic area, but it hasn't.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3265.0) |
|    3274 |  3280 | I mean, I was at UT in the 90s, and, you know, they were starting to see a lot of decline in the 90s.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3274.0) |
|    3280 |  3284 | And so that's really what started to drive the Cumberland Avenue Project.                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3280.0) |
|    3284 |  3290 | And very similar to South Waterfront, the tool the city has used has been infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3284.0) |
|    3290 |  3294 | So Sutry Landing Park, streetscapes, that's what we did on Cumberland.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3290.0) |
|    3294 |  3301 | So, you know, the city doesn't build housing, but we can provide the infrastructure and perhaps a tool to bring that housing in or that commercial in.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3294.0) |
|    3301 |  3308 | So I think those are really good examples of why those districts were selected and why those tools work.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3301.0) |
|    3308 |  3312 | And I know somebody may ask, well, why don't we do form-based code throughout the entire city?                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3308.0) |
|    3312 |  3315 | And I think there's a lot of, you know, we did the recode process.                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3312.0) |
|    3315 |  3319 | This community talked about what our zoning could look like for a number of years.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3315.0) |
|    3319 |  3325 | The incentives, the TIFs that go along with those types of infrastructure projects, again, that would be a really, really big project.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3319.0) |
|    3325 |  3328 | So we've learned a lot from the two we have.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3325.0) |
|    3328 |  3330 | We've got a hybrid model right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3328.0) |
|    3330 |  3336 | And recode, I think, was really the big project that we tackled the whole city from a land use perspective.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3330.0) |
|    3336 |  3337 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3336.0) |
|    3337 |  3340 | That was very good to get that context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3337.0) |

|    3345 |  3346 | I don't have a question.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3345.0) |
|    3346 |  3356 | I just wanted to make a comment because we were talking about density and, like, talking about the retail and the commercial and the density and the balance of that.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3346.0) |
|    3356 |  3367 | For anybody who went to Big Ears and hung out for a while anywhere downtown, it was interesting to observe, like, at Marble City Market particularly.                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3356.0) |
|    3367 |  3370 | We kind of go there with some frequency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3367.0) |
|    3371 |  3381 | And the density that that brought, like the number of people, it wasn't overwhelmed, the commercial that we had.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3371.0) |
|    3381 |  3397 | But it was, like, the density of all the people that showed up for Big Ears and all the locals that showed up for it was the right amount of people to be served by all the venues, the restaurants and et cetera downtown.                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3381.0) |
|    3397 |  3406 | And as I sat there and watched sometime while we were eating one day was just to look at the amount of density that came with that event.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3397.0) |
|    3406 |  3411 | And I was, like, this is the amount of density that we need to support these businesses.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3406.0) |
|    3411 |  3420 | And so because often sometimes we go to some of these businesses and we're, like, it doesn't appear to be the densities to support them on a day-to-day basis.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3411.0) |
|    3420 |  3422 | But that's what we needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3420.0) |
|    3422 |  3433 | So it's, like, however many beds were in those hotels and however many people came to that event, that's the number of dwelling units and people we need to support all that commercial that we've got down there.                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3422.0) |
|    3433 |  3442 | So it was an interesting observation as I sat there that weekend.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3433.0) |
|    3442 |  3450 | Well, and I guess the thing I wanted to add was obviously our discussion today was specifically around walkability.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3442.0) |
|    3450 |  3456 | You know, transparency but then also dealing with how are you going to address parking.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3450.0) |
|    3456 |  3469 | And I really liked that in the parking you already have this recommendation of having landscaping and making sure that I think there was a shade tree that was in there as well at certain growth stages.                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3456.0) |
|    3469 |  3471 | So I thought all of that was really good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3469.0) |
|    3471 |  3478 | What we're really talking about is focusing in on making sure that we're having a very walkable space.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3471.0) |
|    3478 |  3487 | And certainly I think when I've heard from folks in South Knoxville, you know, one of the things I have heard about is parking.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3478.0) |
|    3487 |  3497 | And I think that gets to what Councilmember Smith was saying where maybe, you know, the code is it's future leaning.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3487.0) |
|    3497 |  3500 | And we're not quite there yet I think is kind of what you were saying.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3497.0) |
|    3500 |  3504 | We're growing into it was I think what you said, which I think is also good.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3500.0) |
|    3504 |  3506 | Looking to the future I think is good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3504.0) |
|    3506 |  3514 | And maybe I guess my question maybe was this is for Ms. Toker is, you know, are you still hearing about parking as being an issue?                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3506.0) |
|    3514 |  3518 | And do you feel like this is going to help with that?                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3514.0) |
|    3519 |  3533 | I guess my thought is that if you don't plan for parking to happen at some point, then it may happen in a way that you don't want it to.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3519.0) |
|    3533 |  3536 | And once it's there, it may be there for a long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3533.0) |
|    3536 |  3543 | So I guess are you still hearing concerns about parking in the neighborhoods?                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3536.0) |
|    3543 |  3548 | And, you know, do you feel like this is going to help address that, at least looking into the future?                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3543.0) |
|    3548 |  3554 | I'm not sure that I'm the best person to answer that because I don't live down there.                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3548.0) |

|    3563 |  3566 | Patty, do you want to speak about parking for a second?                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3563.0) |
|    3566 |  3568 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3566.0) |
|    3568 |  3572 | So I'm just not the best person to answer that.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3568.0) |

|    3582 |  3584 | Yes, Patty Barrier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3582.0) |
|    3584 |  3590 | I live at 807 Phillips Avenue in SW1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3584.0) |
|    3590 |  3613 | Anyways, pertaining to parking, the parking issue at least for the four blocks of Phillips where we have the parking permits is, in general, working very well.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3590.0) |
|    3613 |  3628 | However, when there are events, because they're only intermittent period of time, people do illegally park there.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3613.0) |
|    3628 |  3648 | So if you have, like, a couple of apartments and a house, their people may not have anywhere to park.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3628.0) |
|    3648 |  3651 | Some people have to put cones out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3648.0) |
|    3652 |  3667 | I know we usually end up not going anywhere those days because we're pretty sure we probably won't have a parking space when we get back.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3652.0) |
|    3667 |  3678 | And a lot of people are parking between Phillips and Langford, which parking is not allowed because of the steep slope.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3667.0) |
|    3678 |  3687 | There are instances around the school, places like that, where people are parking on both sides to go to events.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3678.0) |
|    3687 |  3697 | And it would be almost impossible for a fire truck to get through or an emergency vehicle.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3687.0) |
|    3697 |  3708 | There is no patrolling of the area by KPD to make sure that things are being followed during an event.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3697.0) |
|    3708 |  3714 | Most people don't want to walk, I mean, park and walk to the event.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3708.0) |
|    3714 |  3716 | They want to be, I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3714.0) |
|    3716 |  3720 | I have two artificial knees and I still go out and walk.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3716.0) |
|    3720 |  3723 | So I don't know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3720.0) |
|    3723 |  3726 | Is there anything else with regards to that?                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3723.0) |
|    3726 |  3728 | It really helped me a lot just to understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3726.0) |
|    3728 |  3741 | I think what you're looking at is if you have that type of situation where people are having to put out cones and, you know, you're having difficulty with parking, eventually something's going to happen where there's going to be some parking put in. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3728.0) |
|    3741 |  3755 | And I think what we're looking at here is proactively dealing with that and making sure that it's in this recommendation that it's going to have landscaping and not be a sea of asphalt look.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3741.0) |
|    3755 |  3768 | So I just wanted to check with you and see or somebody from the neighborhood and see how parking is going and whether or not you felt like, you know, if you did have to have some parking put in, this would be a good way of doing it.                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3755.0) |
|    3768 |  3769 | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3768.0) |
|    3769 |  3780 | And we don't want to lose our permitted parking for the residents that live on Phillips because it has been instrumental.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3769.0) |
|    3780 |  3781 | Very good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3780.0) |
|    3781 |  3782 | Some enforcement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3781.0) |
|    3782 |  3783 | Good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3782.0) |
|    3783 |  3784 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3783.0) |

|    3785 |  3786 | Council Member Smith.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3785.0) |
|    3786 |  3794 | I think I'll just close this off with that comment about parking that, you know, Ms. Barrier mentioned that there is a residential parking permit.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3786.0) |
|    3794 |  3800 | We started it as a pilot about a year and a half ago, and it seems to be working well.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3794.0) |
|    3801 |  3817 | At the same time, there are new apartments being built, and a lot of times we haven't figured out the best way as a city to make sure that apartment guests overnight don't fill up all the public parking.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3801.0) |
|    3818 |  3829 | So to borrow a phrase, I think from a parking standpoint in South Knoxville, we're still kind of scruffy where it's a little wild, wild south sometimes on busy weekends.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3818.0) |
|    3829 |  3833 | But this is progress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3829.0) |
|    3833 |  3834 | Very good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3833.0) |
|    3834 |  3835 | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3834.0) |
|    3835 |  3836 | That seems like a good way to close.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-230622?start=3835.0) |
