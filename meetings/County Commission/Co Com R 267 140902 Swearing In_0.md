| 0:45:08| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| I'll keep this brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| because I know y'all are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| yeah, nobody's here to hear me speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| because I've been reminded multiple times by the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| since I've sat down up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Some folks weren't introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| but are on the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| Our Congressman, Congressman Duncan, if you'd stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| let's recognize you one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| And I missed him at an event last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| so we'll reintroduce him. It's Mark Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| He's standing right there beside our superintendent, Jim McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| Martin Daniels is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| our new state representative. Martin, thanks so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| for being here, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| I want to thank everybody for being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| and I want to congratulate each of these elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| that are seated behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| and I also want to again recognize my wife, Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| and daughter, Isabel, who's being very patient today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| She's wearing her $12 scarf, so we're really proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Oh, I'm sorry, $16 scarf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| How much? $15. I'm sorry, $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| They're getting expensive on me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Well, the past four years in Knox County have been good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| and I look forward to working with all of our newly elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| and those already in office to continue operating in a conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| fiscally responsible manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| We will remain focused on providing high-quality, efficient services to our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| while also serving our taxpayers' dollars well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| In 2010, I stood here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| and jingled the keys to county-owned vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| and promised a new direction in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| Today, in 2014, I'm proud to say that we're heading in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| By the end of the current fiscal year, we have reduced the county's debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| by more than $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| We have saved or will save more than $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| in interest by refinancing some of our existing county debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| We've increased school funding by $46 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| since we took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| We were able to pay cash to build a brand-new school for the Carter community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| all without raising your taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| By taking a conservative, commonsense approach to county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| we were able to maintain a very strong bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| This further ensures that we can get the best interest rate possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| when we do have to go to the bond market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| We also continue to improve the programming of Knox County's senior citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| and will open a new Karn Senior Center later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| I saw Commissioner Andrews back there. That makes him very proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| And improvements, of course, to our veteran service officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| make it easier for local servicemen and women to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| the benefits they've earned by serving our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| At this time, could I ask all of our veterans to please stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| so we could recognize them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| Just stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2883)|
| 0:48:13| We've taken our commitment for veterans a step further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| And now, thanks to the support of the County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| we're proud to guarantee a job interview to any veteran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| meeting the minimum qualifications for an open position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Since then, we've undertaken some important road projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| and we've seen several outstanding economic developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| the largest of which was the $140 million investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| of Fresenius Medical Care Investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| It's a medical care investment that is expected to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| approximately 660 new jobs in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| These are just a few things that we've been able to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| over the past four years. With the help of the men and women on this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| and those already serving in elected office in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| we're going to see great things happen in the future for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267140902swearingin?start=2934)|
