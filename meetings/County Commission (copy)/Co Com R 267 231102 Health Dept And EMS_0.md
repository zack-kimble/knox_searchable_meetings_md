| 0:00:30| Thank you, everyone. It's 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| The Knox County Commission is scheduled to meet at this time and place, along with representatives from the Knox County Mayor's Office, the Knox County Health Department, and the American Mental Response, AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=38)|
| 0:00:55| This meeting is scheduled to last for an hour and 30 minutes, and the purpose of the reason that we are meeting is to discuss the emergency medical services contract selected for Knox County and the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=55)|
| 0:01:12| This is not a voting meeting, so a quorum is not necessary, and there will be no public forum, as was previously announced on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=72)|
| 0:01:26| Anyone that would like to speak to public forum is certainly welcome to come to our workshop or voting meeting when this occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=86)|
| 0:01:35| So, we will take a roll call, just for the record. Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| Commissioner Lundy, Commissioner Durrett, Commissioner Oster, Commissioner Ward, Commissioner Skinmaker, Commissioner Hill, Commissioner Lee, Commissioner Feeler, Commissioner Daly, Commissioner Jay, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=100)|
| 0:01:57| Six members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Thank you, and I have heard from Miss Lundy, who is going to try to make it, if she possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=118)|
| 0:02:05| All right, we'll go ahead and begin this meeting. I see we already have someone at the podium, and I'd be glad to open it with you, sir, if you'd introduce yourself, please. The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=125)|
| 0:02:17| Good afternoon. Kevin Parton, Knox County Health Department, and thank you, Madam Chair, for arranging the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| Hopefully, everybody came with some great questions, lots of consideration questions answered already, so we'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=143)|
| 0:02:33| If you'll notice, I titled this our EMS Ambulance Contract Reset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| The reason for that is that it is just that any of us here who believe that an ambulance service can act and respond the way that they did in 2013, we are setting ourselves up for failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=158)|
| 0:02:52| So, we are looking for a drastic change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| So, how we got here. This has been actually a process over a year now of working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=175)|
| 0:03:03| We've had 11 contract amendments, and our vendor is actually working still in a 23 contract in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| In January, you all approved our contract with Fitch & Associates to come and evaluate the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=192)|
| 0:03:20| We look at the primary tasks, look at the current system contract, look at our performance, recommend areas of improvements, best practices, recommend and assist ambulance system design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=200)|
| 0:03:33| and they assisted in the creation of the RFP as well as the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| Mr. VanDeVate said I had to be less than 25 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Very quickly, to reinforce the things that Mr. Sheridan here came and got me my time limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| how they went about it is they interviewed our current contractor, law enforcement, fire agencies, hospital systems, 911 personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=235)|
| 0:04:05| They did a five-year, multi-year data request to get baselines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| Then we had discussions about the current system and EMS nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| Anybody that wanted to have an interview was granted one with Fitch & Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| Everybody was incredibly engaged and still are to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| We meet with hospitals monthly now. Great progress is being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| One of the more concerning things that we did find out is EMS nationwide, in terms of staff account, there's about a 20 to 25% turnover rate in that industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=274)|
| 0:04:47| Then for two years of COVID, they actually didn't get to have their classes where they graduate EMTs from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=287)|
| 0:04:54| Technically, they're all staffing behind at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| One of the reasons that we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| The RFP model design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| The goals of it were to ensure quality care, provide efficient, reliable EMS service at a reasonable cost to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| Keep that one in mind. We'll come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| Provide the community with an operationally and financially stable system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| Get an equitable response time across the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| Then also develop a system that's fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=324)|
| 0:05:32| Tiered response balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| This is possibly the biggest change that we have inside of the new modeling contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| In our prior contract, basically almost every call had to be addressed as a high acuity call, meaning paramedics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| Everything from a priority one call to a decedent transport and required an ambulance that fit that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=346)|
| 0:05:54| Overall, this creates stress on the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| The new one creates the flexibility that one needs to appropriately address 9-1-1 in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=359)|
| 0:06:07| Appropriate use of the correct resources at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| Highest priority calls will still be answered by medical first response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| That's our friends and neighbors and all of our fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| Our lower acuity calls get triaged down to meet the lowest possible need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| Then, once again, not only are response times met just in the city, but they are throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| It allows our provider to offer virtual care, telehealth, nurse navigation, phone triage, many other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| Moving on, one of the bigger things that you'll see, I know speaking with AMR, they're excited about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| is the county will employ the medical director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| What this will allow us to do is have a local certified emergency medicine physician here to write our protocols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=413)|
| 0:07:02| approve the protocols, real-time data will show if protocols need improvement, enhancements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=422)|
| 0:07:10| They can do clinical reviews, and they will help us develop the clinical scorecard and key performance indicators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| as clinical care is now a portion of the compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| This would be an example of what a scorecard could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| Obviously, this one is just an example, but this is done for every single one of our calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| and then it's reviewed monthly to see how our contractor is performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=454)|
| 0:07:43| Dispatch function, Director Andrews is here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| He will answer all of your questions when it comes to dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| We do know that we'll go to a single CAD system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| Technology fail points will diminish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| Call taking will become more efficient and reduce over-triaging of responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| Inside of our Fitch report, we found that 90% of our calls were prioritized as a priority one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| However, when they got to the billing section of that, 30% of those were billed as low acuity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| meaning we sent high acuity assets to low acuity patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| Software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| So we will own the compliance software used for contract compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| This is an enormous leap forward for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| Currently, as your constituent, perhaps WADGEs a complaint or AMR receives a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| It takes us several days, and Tonya from Director Andrews' crew deserves a raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| because she's the one that I have to call to pull all the data to verify what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| It eliminates duplicative work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| We'll get real-time response times, scenes times, hospital drop-off times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| It'll enhance monitoring of the KPIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| We'll be able to see demand analysis, and it'll also increase some transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| Customer service enhancements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| So the vendor will have a customer service line that's monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| and requires a 30-minute callback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| So what that means is if you receive a complaint, you can direct them to that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| and that's actually reported monthly to us in our compliance meeting going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| And then patient surveys, which I believe AMR already does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| However, we'll be monitoring those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| It's a minimum of 10% of people who receive care, and it's actually done by a third-party vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| Financial stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| This is accomplished in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| The first is rates will be set to 300% of Medicare and updated annually in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| This, according to not only our consultant but AMR and another proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| this is the usual and customary rate for EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| The reason why you set it that way, especially in our area, and why this is advantageous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| is that no matter what you set that rate to, 70% of respondents are Medicare or Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=619)|
| 0:10:30| So it's a flat rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| You could charge them $5,000, and you're going to get reimbursed $300.90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| Twenty percent after that is self-pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| So those will be individuals that are underinsured or have no insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| So payment for that individual is very, very low, if any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| Your final 10% are your private pay, and if you were to go beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| your only hope is that you somehow bill high enough that 10% make up for 90% of your calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=657)|
| 0:11:04| which would be virtually impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| We also want to have the control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| and the know of we're sending our vendor out with our municipal authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=674)|
| 0:11:25| and they are not gouging at our customers, our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| We know that they cannot make up the difference in private pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| and this will fix a past problem of rates not increasing over a certain amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| putting our vendor at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| The second, which is also not new to Knox County but new over the past decade, is the subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=703)|

| 0:12:15| At the end of the year, if they somehow did not make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| because they were penalized for response time or clinical time, that is strictly due to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=741)|
| 0:12:28| We did what we could do to make them succeed, make them profitable here inside of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| That penalty goes directly against any profit that they would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| On to the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=758)|

| 0:13:28| We had our initial kickoff meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Mr. Meyer's group very pleasantly told us that after we receive our proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| we cannot talk to anybody about anything that has to do with this RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| We did so very well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| We had our kickoff meeting. The proposals went to committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| We completed all of those on our own, sent those in with first-round evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=826)|
| 0:13:56| Procurement set up an in-person meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=836)|

| 0:14:12| A virtual meeting was held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| At that virtual meeting, procurement told us who the top two organizations were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| and the committee decided to have those two present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| We had presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Each organization had about an hour, hour and a half, somewhere in that neighborhood, to give a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=868)|
| 0:14:36| We had a very robust discussion after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| We all went home or back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Final evaluations were completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=882)|

| 0:14:51| What did we review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| These are the categories that we reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| You have administration, which included leadership, strategic planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| very important human resource topic, operations, clinical services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| communications, fleet maintenance, quality management, which are business results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| It did include past performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| They had to submit references, which we call or Google, and then there's the subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=912)|
| 0:15:22| Only procurement will evaluate subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| The members of the committee don't do that portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| What did the scores look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| In the administration category, this is kind of how that played out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| Our awardee came in second there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| In operations, they far exceeded everybody else in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| In quality management, they came in second again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| Then when we look at the subsidy, they were first in subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Interestingly enough, beyond those that gave Mr. Anders his $900,000 request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=955)|
| 0:16:05| they gave the most equity for dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| Then overall, this is how the scores tally out, and the award was made to AMR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| which I believe you all have a consolidated version of this that includes subsidy amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| With that, I'll open the floor up for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Hopefully more for Mr. Spencer or Mr. Myers, but either way, we'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=989)|

| 0:16:48| That was very concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| While Mr. Parton is here, before we go any further, I see a light on with Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1021)|

| 0:17:11| and I want to thank those that did submit proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1031)|

| 0:17:28| This is really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| This is one of the most important things we will do, probably, as a commission and a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| hopefully for many years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| My questions and comments are for everyone who is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1057)|

| 0:17:52| My questions and comments are all mixed in together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| I'll tell you, before we go any further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| is there anyone with the mayor's office or even, well, I'll not ask AMR yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1078)|
| 0:18:08| but anyone with the mayor's office that would like to make any type of a general statement before we go any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1088)|
| 0:18:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1100)|

| 0:18:30| This is a heavy, heavy lift, and the work that Mr. Partin has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| the e-mails and texts I've gotten from him at 9 and 10 o'clock at night are evidence of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1116)|

| 0:18:51| Above all, what we're asking this commission to do is trust the integrity of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| None of us had necessarily a preference in outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| What we had was faith in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| We kept it dialed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| One of the things I'm most proud of is that somebody came up to me at a work session a couple weeks ago and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| there have been no leaks, and I've tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| We're proud of the fact that we worked so hard to keep the process buttoned down by the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| and that really is a testament to the work that the staff has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| I did not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| The mayor did not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Nobody outside the committee context knew what the result was going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| nor did we even know what it was until it was decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| Again, I just wanted to commend the staff for the work they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1181)|

| 0:19:47| your efforts at secrecy, for lack of a better word, were quite successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| So that does speak to the integrity that was used as we moved forward in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| So that is greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| It looks like probably the key people that might be asked questions are pretty much toward the front here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| So I will go ahead and turn the floor back to Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| and you can just ask all the questions of these people that you might have, and then we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1215)|

| 0:20:53| I'm very little sleep, especially the last three or four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| I'm just going to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Some of these are my opinions, my comments, feedback, questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| So everyone just bear with me, and I'll just kick us off here with hopefully some really good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| First, over a decade, we've had the discussion that the county's current model for emergency services isn't sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| and for a multitude of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| So we have a real opportunity here and a real responsibility to get this right and bring everyone to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| I also understand the logic about excluding KFD numbers in the Fitch Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| Respectfully, I don't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| I would have liked to have seen those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I also feel like we have a responsibility as a commission to address long wall times with our hospital executives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| and I reached out to them today and requested dates and times for this commission body to visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| and have some on-site tours and talk to those folks because I feel like we owe that to any provider that we select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1314)|
| 0:22:06| So we're doing that because I think I likened it to we're kind of playing baseball without a catcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| So we need that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| First, I want to say that respectfully, I am not comfortable with the response times recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| Again, I've spoken to dozens and dozens of people, and on a personal level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| the thought of my child waiting in an emergency situation for 20 minutes, it gives me great trepidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1349)|
| 0:22:39| Patients in cardiac arrest without care, they're dead in four to six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| Arterial bleeds, three to four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Twenty minutes is hard for me to stomach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Even though we do have paramedics who are quick response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| and I think that's sometimes confusing when you talk about response times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| because the response times we're indicating, that is just ambulance transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| That's not care being given on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| Usually there's a quick response vehicle with a paramedic that is there before a transporting ambulance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| So I want to make sure everybody kind of understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| But what I would like to see is a response time set at ten minutes countywide for all priority one calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| In addition, I would like to see more zones, and with more zones, that means more ambulance, more staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| Whatever it takes to reduce response times and ensure the availability of emergency responders across the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| I think we should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| I know we've got to pick an ambulance provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| I just want to make sure that in this contract we have identified ways that we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| or that our provider can subcontract out services or programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| that they can add additional zones and ambulances and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| They can carve out specific services or programs if they need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| and that they look at mutual aid agreements both within the county and our surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| So those are some general comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| To the references, how many references were contacted, and were they of similar models and population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1452)|
| 0:24:20| I contacted two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| I don't know how many of the rest of the committee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| So you left that up to each individual committee member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| Yes, each committee member had their discretion as to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| Like I said, you could also find out just an enormous amount through the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| It's all in the news everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| And then almost all references, their models were included inside the proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| And then I would like to see some of the patient feedback surveys from our recommended provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| Also, I would like for a provider to implement peer emergency response agency surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| I think that's important when you are looking at collaborating with other emergency response agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| that they kind of communicate with each other how they think you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| I would like to see that included as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Also a question, why weren't financials weighted in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| I just feel like the financial health of the company is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| All reviewer, three of the four proposals had financial data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| and the reviewer could use those at their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Okay, but those were not weighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| They were weighted according to how the reviewer felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| So, for instance, you know, if I reviewed one and it was subpar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| I looked at that as either operational or perhaps a leadership or administration thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| And then to the recommended provider, I'd like to know what your cash reserves are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| and do you have cash to fund expansion if it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| Introduce yourself, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Hey, I'm Brett Jovanovich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| I'm the regional vice president for global medical response in AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| To my right is Josh Spencer, who's the regional director of operations for the East Tennessee market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1570)|
| 0:26:19| Commissioner Frazier, I don't have those numbers at my fingertips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| and I'm certainly not the resident financial expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| I have talking to our GMR CFO, and he's more than willing to schedule time to meet with any of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| or individually via phone or in person for those more detailed questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Do you have a general answer for do you have the cash on hand to fund any expansion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Liquid cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| No, GMR continues to grow and expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| We continue to be a solvent organization that looks for opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| So, yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| And then for the county, go over a little bit about the $1 million performance bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| So what that allows us to do is if our awarded provider cannot provide service to our needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| we can give a 120-day written notice to terminate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| use our performance bond to temporarily stand up service while we go through this RFP process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1637)|
| 0:27:26| And then AMR, you noted in your proposal that there wouldn't be additional operational costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| startup or additional operation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| How is that so if we're not adding services and additional ambulances and staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| I think one of the benefits of being the incumbent provider is that we've already got the required number of ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| We've got the equipment necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| I think it becomes getting us into the new formation of service delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| We know that this new contract going forward is very different, embracing innovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| tiered response where we're adding additional EMT-level ambulances, advanced-level ambulances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| paramedic-level into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| And so for us, the initial startup cost is not as significant as it would be from someone from the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| Quite frankly, we don't necessarily have to wait until February 1st to begin to implement the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| It's something that we can continue to use the current resources we have to get to the right formation under the new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| And then another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Thank you all for your patience with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| I have lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| I know you're shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Will the sale of Rural Metro impact your services or the day-to-day operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| Yeah, from a GMR perspective, that's not something that we comment on related to any pending transactions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1723)|
| 0:28:53| contemplated transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| I would just share that it's been my experience that there is no interruption to day-to-day operations in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| That's really my question to you is that if a new buyer were to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| can we trust that this same process would be in place if there were amendments or changes requested in our agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1748)|
| 0:29:17| And I believe the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Has Knox County ever considered finding hospitals for excessive wall times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| I would have to direct you to Director Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| I don't know that we have the regulatory authority to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| I was just looking at the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| which requires hospitals to have specific requirements of their emergency departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1783)|
| 0:29:51| So that may be something that we can have that conversation with those execs when we take a visit to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| I talked about zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| We talked about mutual aid agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| Would you initiate mutual aid agreements, and do you plan to subcontract with other agencies if the need arises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| Hey, Josh Kutzer, Regional Director for AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| The short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| One of the things I really like about the new, and as Kevin mentioned in his presentation, the unified medical direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| I think that's going to really help bringing everyone together more as a team in a consolidated and a collaborated approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| So we already have mutual aid agreements externally, I think, with other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| and they bring counties for events where we need to reach out for mutual aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| And likewise, we also respond to other counties occasionally to offer them mutual aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| So that will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| But internally, I think it's more your question with other agencies, the fire departments and police departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| and certainly believe that the unified medical director will certainly get us all kind of in the same formation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1853)|
| 0:31:00| But a formal MOU, yes, we can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| But I think the clinical appropriateness of having that unified medical director will certainly guide that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| And then talk to us a little bit how you will address long hospital wait times, recruitment and retention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| performance requirements, insurance reimbursement challenges, because I know there are lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| and then looking at shifting away from zero level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| And, Kevin, if you can take a minute and just explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| because I think that's also confusing to lots of folks of what an actual being at zero level means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1892)|
| 0:31:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Level zero is a readiness term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| You won't find it in the new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| It's kind of expired in its use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| But what level zero truly means is that at the moment a call comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| there is not an ambulance available to directly go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| That doesn't mean that the ambulance does still not get there in 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or whatever the baseline is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| It just means that that one moment in time, there wasn't an ambulance available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| And then would you guys talk about the long hospital wait times, recruitment and retention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| I'll take the first stab at that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| Brett may have some comments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| For long hospital wait times, we've talked about this for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| This is not uncommon in the industry and certainly not in Knox County, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| I guess my first comment would be the health department, Steve, Andy, who's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| have really worked hard on establishing a health care task force, which brings all the partners together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| We're starting at this point really with, I think, the ambulance provider and the hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| and having conversations about what can we do to help solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| We've talked about it before in front of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| We currently are surging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| We have one crew watch four or five patients if they're not critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| We're doing all those things now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| But I think that health care task force really gets us some more consistency with some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| and I think it allows us the opportunity to have more candid, direct conversations about how can we solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| Additionally, I would say I think the best kind of medicine, no pun intended, is really preventive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| and diversion out of the hospitals, those that do not need to be there to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| I think that's the best cure, if you will, for the hospital wait times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| And one of the things that obviously I think was very well established in the RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| and in our proposal is some of those things we're doing to divert patients out of the ED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| who do not need to be in the ED for that very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| So I think that's the most important step is the diversion tactic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| But, Britt, do you want to take on the recruitment and retention question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| I know you've got some answers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Does that answer your question, Commissioner, on the ER wait times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Recruitment and retention, I believe, was your next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| No, absolutely, probably, without a doubt, the biggest single strain on the EMS infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| across the country right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I think it was well articulated by the consultant, and I think Kevin mentioned it earlier in his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| You know, we've seen unprecedented, we being the EMS industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| have seen unprecedented turnover and recruitment, lack of recruitment since the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| Wage pressures to recruit and retain workforce is at an all-time high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| To think just back five years ago that we would be competing with retail space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| or other industries for workforce would have been unfathomable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| But that's the world we find ourselves in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| Couple that with the insurance reimbursements or their lack of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| where we know that governmental payers are reimbursing at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| or below the cost of providing the service makes it extremely challenging to have competitive pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| And so we address pay within our financial model here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| In addition to the wage adjustment that we put into place in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| we also contemplated an additional wage adjustment as part of our subsidy ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| factored in to be able to give a sizable wage adjustment across our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| That was factored into our financial model, which are part of our subsidy ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| In addition to that, and we've implemented this probably over the last three or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| is our Earn While You Learn program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| where we market civilians within the community that want to serve their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| We pay for them to go to school, we pay for their schooling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| and then we offer them employment on the other side of their certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| I think typically on an annual basis, we graduate about 50 or so of those brand new EMTs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| into the market to serve the Knox community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| The challenge is we've got to keep 50 from leaving the industry as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| And it's not all competitive pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Oftentimes it's burnout and exhaustion in a very rapidly changing and stressful environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| And so we spend a lot of time on the mental health of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| GMR has an entire department, GMR Life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| that focuses on the mental health and wellness of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| And so we really have taken a holistic approach to recruiting and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| I would just say that as we think about sort of the next evolution of the Knox partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| having served the community as long as we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| is are there opportunities for us to partner better together in the community in terms of recruiting and retention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| We know that first responders, people are turning away from the industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| whether it's fire, law enforcement, EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| People are turning away from the industry for lower stress, more flexible hours, higher pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| Is there an opportunity for us to collectively partner together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| to have recruiting efforts across all first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| and encouraging our high schoolers, encouraging our technical colleges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| and other members of the community collectively to come serve Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| as a dispatcher, as a firefighter, as an EMS worker, as a law enforcement agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| really see an opportunity for us to work together to bolster up that recruiting effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| I have, I shouldn't say we, I've received just several emails and comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| and I just would like for you to respond to these statements if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| These are just some of the things that as a commissioner that these questions have been posed to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| and asked if I would ask you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| So on behalf of my constituents, I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| Why didn't you address these concerns with the current contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| and how can you convince me or Knox County that it will be different this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2262)|
| 0:37:52| No, absolutely. And I think it's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| And what I'd like to do is sort of unpack the history in sort of three buckets, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| The first bucket I would say would be the contract dating from 2013 to 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| And I think if you go back and you look at our performance driven by the leading indicator of performance penalties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| I want to say we were less than $30,000 or so annually or over a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| which would lead me to believe that our performance under the traditional contract was at or where it needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2299)|
| 0:38:27| The next bucket would very much be the pandemic bucket, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| This is 2020 to 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| And we'll certainly own that the situation and the challenges have certainly impacted the EMS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| And it's been very much a surviving dynamic of how many ambulances can we get on the road with lower staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| Many of the challenges were outlined in the Fitch report were things that were not necessarily caused by anything AMR directly did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| anything that the county directly did or the city directly in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| It was just a product of the new environment that we're currently operating in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| And so that, I think, covers the challenges that we've had over the last two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| And certainly we feel like we continue to work extensively, whether it's our implementation of the nurse navigation product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| wage adjustments, telemedicine components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| We have attempted to solve some of these challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| I think the third bucket comes along in terms of the next evolution of our agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| I really see this as the turning point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| This is the next evolution of embracing innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| I think the traditional decadal contract did not reflect and reward, if you will, some of the innovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| whether it's the tier of responses of getting the right patient to getting the right care to the right patient at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| Certainly I'm excited that clinical is now a major scoring component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| I think at the end of the day, we all want to feel comfortable that constituents that call 911 end up in a better scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2390)|
| 0:39:58| after accessing the county's 911 system than they did before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| Oftentimes response times don't tell that full story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| It's really the clinical dynamics on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| And so we obviously applaud the county for leveraging clinical metrics into the measures going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| I would also say, in addition to all the innovation and the diversion strategies of keeping unnecessary patients out of the emergency room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2417)|
| 0:40:25| leveraging telemedicine and the ET3 and the NurseMav and some of the innovative products that we have that we'll continue to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2425)|
| 0:40:34| is really cultivating better relationships with our peer agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| I'm certainly mindful, and I think Josh would articulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| I feel like we've operated in a world where there's a number of dotted lines across multiple agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| whether that's law enforcement, fire department, AMR, hospitals, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| It feels like under the next contract, there's an opportunity for us to bring everyone together to the table to solve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2453)|
| 0:41:01| again, what I call the next evolution of EMS in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| which involves everything from Mr. Anders' 911 call, from the time that call comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| to whether or not the acuity shifts to nurse navigation, whether it shifts to fire department first response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| to AMR first response, all the way through the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| It's that entire patient experience that I think we collectively have to come together to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| I think those challenges that were articulated in the consultant's reports don't magically disappear overnight because we have a new contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| I think it very much will take all agencies coming together collectively in full transparency of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2496)|
| 0:41:43| full transparency in alignment and direction to ensure that we're all aligned in service level delivery and expectation going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2503)|
| 0:41:52| Thank you. Let me see what I've got left here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| Director Partin, how much will the operational software cost the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| Estimated around $200,000 to $250,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| And then have you determined who will be on the oversight committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| Not as of yet, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| And then to AMR, how many staff members do you anticipate that are needed to fulfill the requirements of the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| How many ambulances and then how many reserve ambulances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| So as far as staff members, we feel like we're probably in the neighborhood, depending on our deployment model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| which we're still kind of trying to flesh out, probably around about 115 to 120 full-time clinicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| between EMT, basic, advanced, and paramedic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| And then with that, we believe, based on the Fitch report and some of our knowledge of the system and our history here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| we'll probably need to be somewhere around 20 ambulances a day, kind of at a peak, to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| As far as the total number of vehicles we have, we have approximately 45 to 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| I don't really know, but the number fluctuates from day to day, of vehicles here in Knox County and ambulances in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| Largely for the reason why we have to have so many, although we only deploy 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| our staggered deployment is intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| So when you deploy a truck at 6 o'clock and another one at 7 and 8 and 9, as it kind of rolls up to more of a peak level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| you have to have multiple vehicles so they don't have to wait on their partner or their other truck to get back to the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| We feel like we certainly have that ability to meet the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| Our staffing, again, is right now we have about 160 or so clinicians currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| Not all of those are full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| We do believe that some of our more aggressive wage scales, more desirable shift types, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| will start to draw employees back to Knox County as full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Commissioner Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| My question is not for AMR, but I guess Mr. Parton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| One of my big concerns about this is it doesn't matter how fast the ambulances respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| It's when patients get to the hospital and it's taken them 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 hours to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| And, you know, we've heard about the shortages, but are the hospitals at this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2666)|
| 0:44:34| are they not answering to why the wait times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| Because I have family members that work in health care, nurses, doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| They're on the front lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| And there's a lot of empty beds at the hospital, but there's plenty of office space, admin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| We don't hear about admin being short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| What are the hospitals doing to basically show up at the table and do a better job of less time at the ER?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2695)|
| 0:45:05| I will hesitate to speak for all the hospitals, but from the meetings that we have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| you see a lot of empty beds, and that is very true across the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| They're working to create what they call their own, very similar to our friends here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| pipelines with University of Tennessee, LMU, all of those that are graduating clinicians on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| to bring on more staff faster and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| And that's great, but I want to talk about the health care, the nurses that are leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| because they're not being compensated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| If you run off the people that have been there 10, 15, 20 years because you're not paying them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| the same as people who are brand new, how is that being addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| Because that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| I can't speak to the hospitals for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| And I know you said that we can't find the hospitals, but what actions can we do to the hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| to make sure they're doing a better job at taking care of patients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| I would have to direct you to Mr. Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| I don't have any regulatory authority over hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| Thank you, Mr. Partin, for leadership in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| I understand the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| It's a big task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| This is a massive thing to tackle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| A lot of work went into getting us to today, but I still think we have a lot of work to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| I do appreciate, I spent a lot of time with you and Mr. VandeVeet looking at the RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2806)|
| 0:46:54| looking at how we're sort of improving the mousetrap, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| and I think there's tremendous improvements to where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| I think we're going to have to do that constantly every three to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| If you ask me what 2013 looked like, I couldn't even fathom it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| But it also, like, there's a really important process before us to pick the right partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| and to make sure that we're doing the best that we can for our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| because it's been a rough few years on everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| And arguably, I think you all have said it, you know, it's been a rough few years with AMR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2849)|
| 0:47:37| and you have to own some of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| The system has to own it, but we can't just constantly blame everything on COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| and just say that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| We all have to get better at either how we design it, how we implement it, how we execute in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| You know, I still think there's a lot of work left to do, but I want to get into some specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| Where did the data come from in which everybody based their proposals on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2881)|
| 0:48:13| How did we get the data for the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Yeah, the number of responses, the number of calls, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| That came directly from the CAD at 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| From the 911 system or from the AMR as a provider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| AMRs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| So from AMR system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| Did anybody verify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| I mean, we assume they gave everybody the exact data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| Did anybody verify it, go through it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| What I'm getting to is I want to make sure everyone got an apples-to-apples comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| when they were doing their bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Or was it just assumed that everyone was given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| I mean, we're asking a current – I'm going to play devil's advocate on a lot of these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| so I'm not saying any of this happened, but I'm just sort of thinking through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| You're asking a current provider to give everyone else that's going to bid against them data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| and then assume that everyone's on the same playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| So the data that the proposers used, what came out of RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| which Fitch created all of that data from the five-year pull at the beginning of their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| Okay, so Fitch had access to that data directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| That's how the – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Is there an extension contract already in place with AMR should this process take longer than the current timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| I think Fitch told everyone early on in the process that the February deadline –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| I think even some of our procurement folks said that the February deadline is tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| Is there an extension contract currently in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| There is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Why was that not done before he started the RFP process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| It was done as we started the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| The contract actually effectively ended last June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| We extended it through February in order to get through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| Okay, so what happens if this process takes longer than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| We negotiate and ask our current provider for an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| Okay, so we're in an extension currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| We are currently in an extension, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| The contract ended its second term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| It was extended once after the initial term in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| Okay, so the contract went through June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| But we were right in the middle of the RFP process to even build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| Yes, we extended this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| There was a very confusing language that the mayor had to come to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| tell him that we were not renewing the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| or extending the contract another five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| During that time, we actually went through the approval process for Fitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| I remember it being confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| It was like, we're canceling this, but we're also throwing that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| but we're going to reissue that and we're going to extend this while we do that other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Okay, so we did all of this last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Well, why didn't we leave a longer lead time in all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3078)|
| 0:51:25| I guess these things take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| It's time, it's committees, it's review, it's structure, it's process, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| I feel a little crammed in the corner of you've got to make a decision really fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| in a short amount of time or Knox County may be in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| Is there an assurance from our current provider that if it does take more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| that they're committed to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| I have not had that conversation with them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| I guess I'll ask that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| That has not been contemplated or asked to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| so that would be something we would have to formally sit down and have a conversation about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| When I look at the selection committee, one of our largest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| arguably our largest partner in county government is the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| And they are certainly the largest, arguably the largest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| Their constituency is ours, of course, but it's a massive customer of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| Why wasn't the City of Knoxville, the Soxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| or somebody key in that constituency group that does operate a municipal fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| and works so closely, why weren't they part of the selection team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| That's a great question and one that we struggle with greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| It would have been very difficult to bring on one of our fire partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| and not bring on all of our fire partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| But some representative of that emergency services world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| certainly their perspective in grading and picking the next person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| they're going to have to use as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Right, and that's the reason why we asked and Colin Ickes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| who serves both the city and the county, was brought on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| Can you just broadly explain this grading process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| First off, was the scoring relative to others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| or were they scored on their own metrics individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| Were the evaluators going, okay, I'm going to score this one in a silo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| and then I'm going to stop, or were they kind of comparatively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| Comparatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| Can you administration, operations, quality management, and subsidy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| can you just broadly explain those four categories for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| Subsidy, I'll start there just because it's the simplest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| It's the five-year total of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Now we'll have to ask Mr. Myers how they rank that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| because that's a formula-based that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| The only procurement does cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| So inside of administration and leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| we looked at those that would actually be here managing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| We looked at corporate management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| We looked at strategic planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| One of our proposers, unfortunately, that didn't make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| actually didn't have one, so you automatically take points away for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| And then human resources, how they treat their individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| how they hire, programs that they use to recruit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| earn as you learn, military bridge, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| So that's what was in your administration and leadership bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| In your operations, we looked at clinical services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| focusing a lot on not just the term you call, we call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| really what's innovating about your particular organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| What are you doing to, as they said, divert individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| that are not as sick as they are away from the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| to keep them from waiting hours and hours and hours at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| Communications, it worked with Director Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| How will they mesh with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| What do they put on their vehicles for location devices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| What equipment do they use as radios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| All of those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| And then medical equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| So if you were to look at a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| they all listed all of the amazing equipment that goes on each one of their ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| So you have the very similar characteristics there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| Quality management, that's your customer focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| Business results, information, analytics, really interesting part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| That's where they obviously they send their references in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| very much like those that if you were to be applying for a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| they don't send the references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| That would say something bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Hence the reason I say Google.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| Customer market focus is what's their community engagement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| Are they out recruiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| Are they out giving classes, CPR, things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Information and analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| Do they use data to drive their decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| A really big portion of this is going to be your QI, QA programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| Do you have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| How often does it meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| When will it meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Here in Knox County we want a monthly one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| That's where we're going to bring in all of our first medical responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| City, fire, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| Sit down and talk and see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| County medical director leads the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| making sure everybody is on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| And then certifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| if they're certified by another ambulance certification service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| There's a couple of elements that I don't think were included here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| should have been, but I wonder, like, past performance should be one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| but you've only got one of four that you've worked with for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| So it's hard to compare the other ones, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| unless you looked at their performance in other markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| Was that ever a discussion of how do you again compare four bidders on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| performance when you only have one that you've actually interacted with here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| So they all submit references and they all submit those that are large enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| I will say we were lucky enough to have the two largest providers in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| nation actually bid on our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| I think that says a lot for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| But they all submit references and contracts that they have with a number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3468)|
| 0:57:56| people, populations, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| And so that's a very easy way to see who is already in the space that could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| handle 526 square miles, half a million people at any given point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3483)|
| 0:58:10| So that's another way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| Don't go very far, but Mr. Myers, can you break down the four subsidy levels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3494)|
| 0:58:23| I have them in each of the proposals, but help me just write them down on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| I don't have the subsidy numbers in front of me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| All it is is a mathematical formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Not how you graded them, what the total was, like per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| You've got AMR, was it how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| It's a five-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| Not the total over the contract, just a per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| He's looking at per year, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| We've got a five-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| You're handed a five-year subsidy number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| We can get to a one-year if that's what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| Five-year was $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| $11 million for AMR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3544)|

| 0:59:19| And that's for a total of five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| That's a five-year total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3563)|
| 0:59:30| This goes back to two related questions of elements that were not in the grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| Did the selection committee look at or ask any information about staffing levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| current, past, turnover rates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| How do you determine the health of an organization with their people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| and their ability to manage people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| I mean, if I see a company who says I have 160 people today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| but they used to have 450,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| then that's a different discussion if they had 180 last year and 160 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| Was there any of that consideration of sort of what's the health of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| workforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| That's covered in that HR portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| There were no, at least I do not recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| any specific questions of how many people are you currently staffed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| But you didn't really dig into how healthy are they as an organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| We see through the proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| we see what they do to maintain the health of their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| or create a workforce environment that they want to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| And I think Commissioner Fraser touched on this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| Why wasn't the fiscal health of each company weighted in a way that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3643)|
| 1:00:52| almost a separate category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Because to me that's a huge deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| We're about to pick a provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| We need to make sure they're financially solvent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| A, have the resources to invest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| B, and have a prospect for a healthy company in the future, C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| So it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| And I would say there's no single way to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| So while you might consider net income the driving force to how healthy an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| organization is, Commissioner Fraser might think EBITDA is more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| So if you two are on the evaluation committee and we have it as weighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3694)|
| 1:01:41| in financials, you could give them a zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| and she could give them a 300 based off of a single number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| Yeah, but I think you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| I mean, debt would be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| EBITDA would be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=3712)|

| 1:07:45| our private entity is a restriction set by the government between two private entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4065)|

| 1:07:55| Wouldn't our subsidy be lower if they were able to bill more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| That's on the assumption that they're able to collect more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4081)|

| 1:08:25| but that's the part I can't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4105)|

| 1:08:43| But one of the things that I think is important for this commission to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| is when you execute a contract with a vendor, you essentially convey to them municipal authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| They operate under authority of Knox County as the exclusive provider of this service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4133)|

| 1:09:31| One of the reasons we felt strongly about capping it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| in addition to the fact that it does represent the industry standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| and it is usual and customary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| is that we do not feel comfortable sending somebody out with blanket authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| to set charges based on unilateral or business-driven assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4186)|
| 1:09:54| It's just too open for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4194)|

| 1:10:04| You're going to get the ambulance we send you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| I guess I understand that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| I think we're stuck in that in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| Yes, we're sending you what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| I don't know. I'm stuck on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| I think it's really difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Would you agree if they were able to collect more money, we would have less subsidy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| I would, but I'd also agree with Mr. Partin's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| His point is that this does create some interesting issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| Do you simply send the vendor out to bill whatever they can from whoever they can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| So if they go out into the mission district and they pick somebody up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| and that poor soul has $20 in his pocket, they collect that $20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| they come to your house or my house, we have good insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| and they collect $9,000, that's problematic to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| We think there needs to be some structure and consistency in the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| and this is the way to give us that structure and consistency in the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| This was a tough one, though. We did wrestle with this quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| We do that with our fire service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| We essentially say for the 20%, 30% of the people that have subscription fire service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4266)|
| 1:11:14| we're okay with you subsidizing everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| They're going to show up anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| They get a different level of bill, but they're holding the share too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| They do, but interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| They actually don't operate under a contract with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| One of the things we hope that comes out of the eventual new ownership of Rural Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| is we feel very strongly there should be a contract with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| but currently Rural Metro operates within the district that is approved by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| and reaffirmed by this body every three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| but there is actually no contract between Knox County government and Rural Metro Fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| None exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| In this case, there's absolutely a contract, and that authority comes directly from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| Okay. All right. Thank you. I'll move on from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| I just have one last statement. I'm going to give the floor up to other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| I know we have a lot of questions, and I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| This is a question for our provider, AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| Several years ago, I can't even remember when it was, but I think it was pre-pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| and then again during our pandemic, AMR came to this body and made assurances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| We will do better. We will have more rigs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| We will have more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| We will do better as a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| Right now, constituents that I talk to, the vibe in our community is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| I'm not waiting on an ambulance because it takes too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| If I can throw somebody in a car, I'm going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| and I hear that feedback from our first responders as well, especially our police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4363)|
| 1:12:51| You don't have to answer this right now, but at some point during this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| you're going to have to convince this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| how are you going to do better if we give you another shot at it again and again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| I mean, you've been the provider for 10 years, 11 years, 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| and you've made many assurances that haven't come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| How are you going to do better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| How are you going to be the provider that we can count on, that our constituents can count on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| Because if the vibe in the community that I get the feedback from is it's not worth waiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| then we have a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| You were happy to respond, or if you can do that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| No, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| Happy to follow up and provide more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| I will tell you what we're comparing is apples to oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| This contract is materially different than the traditional lens that we've been looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| It focuses on innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| It focuses on better efficiency and utilization of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| And as I mentioned earlier, it's removing the dotted lines of multiple first responders within the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4423)|
| 1:13:50| not necessarily working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| I see that opportunity really manifesting itself in this new world, this new agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| We're very confident we can operate because it is a completely different world under this new agreement, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| It's innovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| It's all the things that the 2013 world was not, that the 2023 world is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| I will tell you, I think the other thing, and we spent some time and articulated it in our proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4451)|
| 1:14:17| very much is community outreach and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| I think there needs to be significant dollars invested in educating the public on the appropriate utilization of 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4459)|
| 1:14:26| If that's ad campaigns, if that's other things, AMR continues to be committed to quarterbacking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4466)|
| 1:14:35| But when you look at the detail of the utilization of 911 for true non-emergencies, the numbers are pretty staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| And so if we could do a better job educating the community on the appropriate utilization of 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| what to expect when you call 911, from the time they call 911 to Director Anders' 911 center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| to our nurse navigation triage line, to telemedicine, really working collectively together and educating the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4494)|
| 1:15:03| that is where we see the opportunities and what I'll call the Knoxville 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| It's really embracing all of that innovation that historically was not embraced from the 2013 contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4508)|
| 1:15:18| And I'm going to just ask one question since you've already addressed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| And while I'm asking it of you, Mr. Partin, Mr. Anders, would you please come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| Kevin, did I hear you make the statement that, did you say 70% of the calls that were originally coded Priority 3 were in fact ones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4531)|
| 1:15:46| Is that what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Sort of opposite of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| So they coded over 90% of their calls as Priority 1s, and actually 30% of those were actually low acuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4551)|
| 1:16:01| Were actually Priority 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Priority 3s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Oh. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| So we definitely need some help in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| Yes, and hopefully Director Anders can speak more to how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| But really that goes back to that, making sure we have the right people giving the right treatment at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| Yes, and I would like to hear from Mr. Anders as to, since you will be a new player in this, so to speak, what might be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4582)|
| 1:16:32| What might we expect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| Well, I think with the new contract comes the new medical direction, which will change the question somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| It will change the opportunities for people to get a Priority 1, 2, or 3 call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| We'll hopefully change that number from 90% down to where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| And I don't know where it should be, but there's multiple studies nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| I think Houston was one where of all of the calls that they received, only 2% required life-saving treatment on the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4614)|
| 1:17:02| And so 2% to 5%, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| What it's going to do for us as a community, I think, is Richard and his team that operate in our building currently, they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4627)|
| 1:17:18| There's no question that they're passionate about community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| They're passionate about the work they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| They've been great teammates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| But currently we operate on two technologies on the phone system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| We operate on different radio systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| There's a lot of fail points in those technologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| And we want to eliminate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| We want every 911 call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| And when I came in four years ago, I mean, this is nothing that snuck up on Richard or snuck up on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| I told them in our next ambulance contract, I wanted to ask that we did the dispatching, just for continuity of service and public transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4665)|
| 1:17:53| And so once the contract was rebid, we requested the mayor's office on several occasions, several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| And going back to what Larson J. said about the fire department not being involved, we spoke to Fitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| We, as 911, spoke to Fitch three or four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4686)|

| 1:18:11| He got in our CAD system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| He was extremely knowledgeable about how to go and find the things he needed to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| I think the fire departments, all the fire departments, had the same conversation with Fitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| And them not being part of the grading process was one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| But we were all involved in the beginning of that Fitch report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| But what it will do is for the community, allow us to answer the call and dispatch the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| And it's on one set of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| It's on one set of employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| There will be, like right now, if there's a complaint about EMS or a response to anybody, they call us and them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| That will eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| This new contract will eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| If adopted, we'll eliminate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| It will be one-stop shopping for anything 911 related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| Will your dispatchers be trained differently from the ones who currently are dispatching ambulances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4735)|
| 1:19:03| I think some of the same services will be in place, nurse nav and everything that they're providing as a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| We'll just transfer those calls to nurse nav just like they do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| We hope to interview and train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| They're all going to be APCO certified just like they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| They're all going to be trained on what the medical director advises on the protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| We hope to interview some of their employees if they downsize or give their employees the opportunity to come work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| Because they are very good at what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| And along with that process, we're inheriting rural metro and Seymour dispatch at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4778)|
| 1:19:47| We've got quite a turnaround to perform between now and February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| As I anticipate, Richard will work with us well in that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| The community will not be left behind because we can't get equipment in or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| The equipment is already in the room that's theirs and we'll work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| But we're going to have to spend, of our dollars, of 911's dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| we're going to spend close to $500,000 to make this happen before February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| So this is no small task for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| Thank you. And would you give your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| Brad Anders, the Executive Director of Knox County 911-605 Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| Thank you. Thank you. Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| I want to start with a couple of things that I like about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| That might change it up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| First of all, the thing that I really like to see that Director Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4844)|
| 1:20:49| and his staff was going to be involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| I have the utmost respect and confidence in him and his office and the way that you run E911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4852)|
| 1:21:01| And I think that we all feel better about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| I like that we're getting a new medical director for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| I think that we probably, the salary is a little worky to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| I don't think that that's where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| But that's a discussion that I would like to have with you guys later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4883)|
| 1:21:30| That we will now own the software system, and I really like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| because I think that just puts Knox County kind of in the driver's seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| that we keep that software as opposed to a company having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| I do like the million-dollar bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| You know, hopefully that you never have to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| But we've seen on other situations that Knox County has to pull bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| for things that aren't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| You certainly don't want to see that happen with an ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| So there's a couple of things that I had, and then I had a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| from constituents that I wanted to be able to kind of throw at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| And then, Josh, I've got a couple of things for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| Why did the mayor's office choose a response time outside the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| that are six minutes later than the national standard for rural metro EMS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| when the standard is 14 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| So what that takes into account is not only that accreditation model that you saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| That also takes into account the current state of EMS inside our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| Now, realize that that 20 minutes, that's a baseline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| That's not their goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| Their goal is to be there in eight minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| That's just the longest that we will give them before we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| you have crossed the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| And as Commissioner Frazier pointed out, in those high-acuity calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| you will have a medical first responder 99% of the time from our fire stations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| Our partners in fire are amazing that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| I believe Mr. Seymour told us that they ran four, almost 5,000 calls last quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| So it's not that somebody won't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| It might be that somebody won't be there to take you in the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| But that's how we got to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| Okay. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| This is nothing, and I understand that this is nothing that county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| or Knox County can force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| But this is something I as a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| and hopefully the rest of the commissioners will agree that I believe we need to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| with the CEOs of the hospitals in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| We need to sit down with the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| We need to sit down with the ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| We need to sit down with E911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| We need to have a very open conversation of the fact that we all are working for the same goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| of taking care of our constituents in Knox County and their health as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| I said this a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| Unfortunately, I had to be at the hospital with my son last month a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| And unless you've been in there, and I think every commissioner needs to go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| and you need to see what it's like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| Out in the ER might not have looked as bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| But when you get back there and there are beds lined, as far as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| on both sides of the hall, it's a little unnerving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| When my son had a nurse that had 15 patients, he was fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5076)|
| 1:24:44| But that is not even acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| There again, that's not our purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| But it is our purview to say this is more than an ambulance problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| This is a medical problem that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| And this is a multilayer problem that we've got in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| And there's a lot of things that I think don't want to be talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| but I think that they need to be talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| So I think it needs to be a hard meeting where everybody kind of checks their feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| and their egos at the door and says we're going to work for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| And we're going to move this forward and make sure that we're taking care of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| So I would like to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| I don't know how that we can perform that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| but hopefully my colleagues will agree with that and we can get something going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| Help me to understand what new system might be used in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| So the mission area is, if I'm understanding it, about 4% of the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5138)|
| 1:25:46| I could be wrong on that percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| But I need to know is there going to be a paramedic that's going to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5148)|
| 1:25:55| Is there going to be, you know, nurse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| Is it teledoc?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| Is there something that is going to be performing for people that don't necessarily need to go to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5161)|
| 1:26:08| but they need to see a medical provider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| And that might be a question for Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Sure, I'll take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| The goal is obviously to get care to the patient, all patients, as quickly as possible, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| All of them don't necessarily require an ambulance, lights, and siren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| All of them may not require a fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| All of them may not require an ambulance to transform the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| But certainly the opportunity is great there in that one particular part of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| where we do have a very large utilization issue of the 911 system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| As Brett mentioned earlier, and I think I said before, the goal is we've all got to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| to figure out what's the best solution for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| I think it has to be members of the health department, members of the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| the city fire department, law enforcement, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| Some concepts that we certainly have explored and ideas that we have thought of are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| can we put a paramedic or call it a crisis response team, call it whatever you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| in that district and where they can offer real-time virtual care to a physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5228)|
| 1:27:15| to eliminate the transport to the hospital potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| Many of these patients, once they go to the hospital, we can't leave them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| because of their particular complaint or their particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| And that's what really causes the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| The best case scenario is utilizing technology that we have, unified medical director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| and partnerships with all stakeholders to best solve that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| So I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| Yeah, I mean, I think we don't need to kind of put our heads in the sand that that's a major problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| And it's becoming a major problem all over this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| And I think people have to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| And I'm glad that you said the police because I meant to say KPD and KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| I want to be in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| There was a couple other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| Help me explain why, and I guess maybe I'm confused on this, but why the ambulance service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5285)|
| 1:28:13| and I'm saying AMR right now because that's our current ambulance service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5293)|
| 1:28:17| they're transporting deceased individuals as opposed to the medical director transporting deceased individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5297)|
| 1:28:30| Why is that happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| The medical director isn't here, so I will do my best to articulate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| The transported deceased and even some of the behavioral ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| which I believe you had questions about, that is a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| Our ambulance services, they are already working those particular hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| For us to try to find somebody to do that, say, bidding that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| the staffing for that is extremely challenging in that you have to be available 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| seven days a week, nights, weekends, holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| And so that becomes very, very difficult to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| I understand, but we're sitting here saying that we can't get the ambulance on time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| to people who need to get to the hospital to be saved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| and we don't have another area that comes and takes deceased people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| That's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| And one of the things in the new contract is we don't require an ambulance to transport that deceased individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5377)|
| 1:29:44| We've done all that we can do for that person on this earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| We just request that somebody from our service provider go with a respectable vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5389)|
| 1:29:56| that can perform the job and do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| And in this iteration of the contract, there's actually a performance measure to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| to where prior there was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| So hopefully that gives some release to our law enforcement agencies and those responding to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| Yeah, I think that definitely is something that needs to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5413)|
| 1:30:21| There was one other thing that I needed to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| With AMR, on your staffing, and I don't think that this is a surprise to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5426)|
| 1:30:33| that since 2020 nobody can get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| I mean, you can't get workers anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| You're not getting workers that want to be in the medical field, law enforcement, EMT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| You're not wanting to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| So your challenge is high, just like it is with the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| What I see with the hospitals, you have a lot of nurses leaving the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| going to a lot of clinics that do Botox and medical stuff and that kind of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5456)|
| 1:31:03| because it's great hours and you get paid well and you don't have holidays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| and you don't have sick people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| I can't blame them for that, but that's not helping our situation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| Just like you guys, it's not helping your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| Have you – I mean, I would like to see a plan in place of recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| and really going into the schools, going over to Pellissippi, going over to Rhone State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| and really hammering getting kids to come out and get excited about EMT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| if there's things that you guys can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| So that's not necessarily a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| It's just something that I would like to see maybe as a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| that you guys would be interested in kind of showing us what you are trying to do on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| Yeah, happy to provide that, and we're certainly interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| We do have a recruiter locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| Our supervisors will attend health fair events and all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| We're doing that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| And I will just say, I think it's partly wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| Don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| I think the wage war continues, and not just with competing similar services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| but more with other things that we've never competed with before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| But most importantly, I think folks want to know that, number one, EMS providers, it's a calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| If they're doing – nurses and everyone – if they're doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| they're called to that and they realize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| And we have to acknowledge that as leaders in the industry that we're here to help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5540)|
| 1:32:25| help your calling become something to afford to live on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| But most importantly, it's about the culture, and it's about the work-life balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| and all the other pieces of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| It's not just about a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| And I think we have outlined some of our challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| and obviously some of our solutions to those problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| to where recruiting and retention can certainly be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| I will say that through the RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| it certainly creates some anxiety among our workforce for obvious reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| But even since just last Thursday when the intent to award was announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| we already started seeing momentum and the buzz kind of pick back up again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| and the excitement of, you know, let's get to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| Let's start solving the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| I'm happy to provide details on any of our recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| Yeah, just anything that you guys come up with as a company that can kind of guide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| And then I'll close with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| I think wall time is extremely important, and I've had that conversation with AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| We never really have gotten the full understanding of who's responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| when they drop the patient off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| What I understand, it's the hospital's responsibility when you hit their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| My problem with that is, yes, I think that's exactly what you need to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| so you can get that truck turned around and get back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| The problem is we don't have the staff in the hospital to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| And if you are an EMT or a nurse or a doctor or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| your main job and responsibility and passion is to take care of that patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| and not drop that patient off and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| And if you've got a nurse that's got 15 patients, she can't beóit's not humanly possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5641)|
| 1:34:08| So I think wall time is a major issue, and maybe that will come out of that meeting with everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| if we can put everybody together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| I think they have done better, and I know that Covenant is doingó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| you're going to have kind of two different ERs now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| where you're not going to have your really high illness to your next ER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| and maybe that will help on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| But I think wall time is a problem, and obviously from all my constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5673)|
| 1:34:40| the response time up to 20 minutes isóthat's where they're kind of losing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| So I think those are some things that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| One of the benefits of going almost last is that most of the good questions are already asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5695)|
| 1:35:01| but I've got a few anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| Director Partin, this body in January, as you stated, appropriated $125,000 to Fitch & Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5704)|
| 1:35:14| to develop the guide work for an EMS contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| How come we didn't let that play through until we got the final report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| Why did we have to go in midstream and take their draft report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| and use that as the guide to do the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| We're using their final report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| You had their final report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| We got the final report last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| I think we're working off a draft report, were you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| The basis of the response zones and all of that, yes, that was what you would consider draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5747)|
| 1:35:56| but it was all built off of the same data as Commissioner Jay was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| As most of the commissioners have said, we're concerned about the response time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| and particularly in the Fitch report on page 13, it identifies the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| which is in my district, is the number two entity that requires ambulance service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5776)|
| 1:36:25| In that same report, we're now going from the current contract of 17 minutes up to 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5785)|
| 1:36:37| On page 15 of the Fitch report, it specifically says that the contractor did not meet the 90th percentile requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5797)|
| 1:36:45| for the years 2021 and 2022, even with the seven-minute allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| So does someone look at this from a different angle and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| well, now you're going from 17 to 20 minutes to allow the contractor to try to hit that 90% threshold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5816)|
| 1:37:05| I suppose you could take that outlook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| I look at it the opposite in that your current time is more than 20 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| so I'm actually pulling that number back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5832)|
| 1:37:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| So you're saying a call to Farragut is more than 20 minutes currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Well, in the data of 2022, all of our outlying areas that were not at City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5846)|
| 1:37:34| with the exception of what the district has called PAL, it's AMR data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5854)|
| 1:37:41| I'm not sure how large that is, but with the exception of that, yes, everybody was over 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| The way that the prior contract worked is that the vendor, AMR, or any vendor that we would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5867)|
| 1:37:56| they could put all of their assets into the center of the city where over 90% of the calls are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| meet their compliance needs for the contract, and then the rest of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| not necessarily flounders because, like I said, medical first response will be there to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| but not in 10 minutes or 10 plus 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| We were experiencing over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| So this new contract forces them to put assets out into our county regions to meet the 20-minute 90% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5898)|
| 1:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| And then in the information that you provided to me earlier today, you talked about your department find AMR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5909)|
| 1:38:40| the different for the last six fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| And in fiscal year 18, it was only $116,000 basically, but last year it was over $1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5924)|
| 1:38:54| So if they're not meeting the response times and now they're paying tenfold more than what they were in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5934)|
| 1:39:04| how could the committee keep scoring them so high for response times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| And then the other thing is you've mentioned in here in your email that penalties that this body weighed totaled $8.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5949)|
| 1:39:19| Was that for the same six fiscal years or is that just the last couple of years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| Just the last couple of years where amendments came forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| And that's where we could have collected the 8.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| but this body gave them a pass in hopes that they would use that to improve their situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| I guess this would be a question for AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5980)|
| 1:39:47| We continually heard that there's a labor shortage in ambulance personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| I noticed that you closed your Davidson County office this year and laid off 72 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| How many of those 72 employees were sent to Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| I was asking Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| I believe we retained five employees that moved over from Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| We did offer, obviously, relocation opportunities and whatnot for those individuals to come over to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| Is the appropriation of the $2.1 million going to come out of the health department's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6026)|
| 1:40:33| That would be a question for Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| It's not currently in my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| And in the RFP, I noticed that the – where is it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6041)|
| 1:40:50| You could ask for an audit of the ambulance provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| Did you include that in the new RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| Did you include that in the new proposed contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| It has an option to require an independent audit solely at its discretion and at the contractor's cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| We're using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| If you go into the contract, there's a buffer there that will say if our awarded vendor has a profit of more than 12 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6073)|
| 1:41:25| then the county does not need to subsidize that operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Obviously, they're doing well, so they don't need our funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| Have we ever done an audit under the previous contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| That wasn't in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| And was there ever the part in there that said we had the option to inspect the ambulances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6099)|
| 1:41:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| That was in the RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| Yes, that was in the prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6108)|
| 1:41:50| The state annually inspects all ambulances, and we receive an asset list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| Steve Hamby or, prior to that, Larry Hutzel, the emergency response coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| he actually goes during that audit and inspects those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| And then we also have the ability to, anytime that we would like, inspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| And then for my education, if a call to 911 for an ambulance within the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6130)|
| 1:42:19| does a city fire vehicle respond first and an ambulance second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| Many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| Sometimes an ambulance actually reaches there before the fire department does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| But they're required to go at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| Only on your high acuity calls, your priority one calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| So if you, you know, stubbed your toe, Mr. Spencer can tell you a story about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| Your low acuity calls, we do not dispatch fire on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| Just high acuity, life-threatening calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| And then, but we have no formal agreement with, that you stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| with the city of Knoxville fire department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| There's no formal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| By state statute, they're a first responder, a medical first responder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| and that's how they roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6190)|

| 1:43:54| And the other thing is, under this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| if when an ambulance is dispatched to a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6240)|

| 1:44:25| I guess I kind of feel the same as Commissioner Jay where, you know, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| this has been kind of a hurried process where everything has to be done because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6270)|

| 1:44:47| we're stuck because we've got to make a legislative decision to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6287)|

| 1:44:58| decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6298)|

| 1:45:18| not questioning you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| I do have a few questions that are more city focused because my district is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| completely within city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| Jovanovich earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| you said all agencies will be coming together and this would promote full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6332)|
| 1:45:39| transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| So are those communication lines to kind of go on what my colleague was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| saying with KFD, are those lines open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| I have received complaints even from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6349)|

| 1:45:57| yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| care is being received within that three to 10 minute timeframe because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| they are there on those high acuity calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| The problem is transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| So I guess my question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| are we making sure they are looped in and is if there are transport issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| but also what are your plans to improve that in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| in those scenarios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| Great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6386)|
| 1:46:27| And something that I said earlier just feel like we haven't done a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| job collectively together as all first responder agencies and coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| I think the unified medical director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| one medical director over all first responders will help tie us together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| for all the right reasons at the clinical level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| which is focused on the most important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| which is the patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| But no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| I think our vision is to continue to expand the work without departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| already done with the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| We proposed an EMS oversight committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| which I think would have members built from representation of the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6420)|

| 1:47:07| all stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| I think that's something that has never been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| And if it has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| then it's fallen by the wayside and needs to be rekindled under this new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6433)|

| 1:47:23| parties to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| to work on alignment of expectation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6444)|
| 1:47:28| alignment of protocols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| alignment of handoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6449)|

| 1:47:40| I think the fact that we'll have aligned leadership from a medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| director perspective will certainly hold that accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6463)|

| 1:49:30| utilization problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| And an efficiency problem maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| And I think again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| and I know we keep pointing back to the unified medical direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| but once we get to a point where we have everyone on the same page aligned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6580)|

| 1:49:52| That's the most important thing we can do to solve or help the wall time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6592)|

| 1:49:58| There, there are days as, as mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| I think in the Fitch report under the proposed plan that you would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| I think it's 19, 20 ambulances at peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| Today at peak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| we have 23 ambulances on the road and we're still having the same issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| because they're just, there's this bottleneck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| And the only way we want to solve the problem is to get extremely aggressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| into the version and the, and the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6618)|

| 1:50:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| I would just add from a, what are we doing today perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| It backs up probably what have we been doing the last few years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| And you may have heard the hospitals or others talk about surge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| We have essentially take a AMR funded employee and man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| the emergency rooms to stay with our patients so that those ambulances can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| get back in to service quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| We've also identified the opportunities with some partners to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| because we recognize part of the hospital's throughput process or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| or bottleneck becomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| they can't get patients off the floor to move the patient from the ER up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| So we've partnered with several hospitals on discharge lounges again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| man by AMR to help the hospitals with their throughput challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6666)|
| 1:51:11| I think and appreciate you referencing Knox 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| I think there's some additional technologies where we can put technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| within the emergency departments that will show all inbound and outbound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| traffic, which may help the charge nurses and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| better prepare that they've got five ambulances coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| It will also produce some color coding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| which would allow them to know that they've got six ambulances that are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| the wall and have been here in excess of an hour, two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| I know currently today we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| we leveraged the work with the public health hospital coordinators to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| identify which hospitals are on diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| And while we can certainly recommend the patient that hospital XYZ is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| diversion status and there may be excessive delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| ultimately it's the patient's choice provided you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| the patient's in a stable scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6720)|
| 1:52:01| It's the patient's choice to what hospitals they want to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| So oftentimes we can make all the recommendations in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| But at the end of the day, if that's where the patient wants to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| we ultimately have to take the patient to that, to that destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| I will tell you, we continue to meet with the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| I'm trying to find solutions. I think the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| which is now probably only a month or two old is starting to get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| traction. I think it's got representation of all the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| I think we've gotten past the finger pointing and the blame game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| and we're starting to get down to the brass tacks of how do we accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| And I think we'll see progress over perfection because it's not going away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| And I think we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| we will begin to move away from this surviving mode to this thriving mode by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| getting all of those players to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| Moving on to a course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| one of those issues again is staffing shortages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| And you discussed increasing salaries with debt looming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6778)|
| 1:53:05| How are you going to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| I mean, I know there's subsidies involved, but, but how else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| Yeah, no, I mean, great, great question. I just, and, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6793)|

| 1:53:31| I don't want to confuse our debt with our sort of operating performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| You know, our debt is associated with capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| not necessarily day-to-day operations. And so our model is very solvent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| Our model has been solvent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| We continue to make investments in the community. We did a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| almost a 20%, 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6829)|

| 1:53:59| We factor that into our model going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| And so almost 50 ish percent of that 2.1 ask is going directly back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6842)|

| 1:54:27| Response times are shorter and we've got the updated response times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6867)|

| 1:54:51| help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| We have monthly compliance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| So that's where all of that would come from. Steve Hanby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| our emergency response coordinator holds that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| Okay. So, but there is a specific person. It's not just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| we're going to make it nice and pretty and this is magically going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| because there are those days when things aren't going to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6907)|
| 1:55:12| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6912)|
| 1:55:13| there are going to be days when or weeks or months or hopefully years where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| compliance is met all the time consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| So I appreciate that. And last comment, this is more, just more of a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6921)|

| 1:56:13| I have a couple of comments and then we'll close with commissioner for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| Frazier's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| I agree about the response time, 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| I'm West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| We have the probably heaviest population out there. And it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| and even though usage might not be quite as up, that is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| a real concern and whoever gets the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| I hope they will consider perhaps adding other stations to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=6999)|
| 1:56:46| to be able to meet that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| The second thing is we hear over and over about staffing shortages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| I do understand that the starting salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| even with the last way to judgment adjustment for a paramedic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| I believe it was like $16 and 20 cents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| roughly 16 plus my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| my comment to that is I do understand it's a certified program and I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| also told that it was a, a union negotiated rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| Having said all of that though, I can see why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| especially in Knox County and I get having to have a calling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| I come out of education that you still have got to make enough money to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| to take care of yourself and to feed a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| Is there anything preventing you from starting higher than the industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| standard for our entry level folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| I would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| our proposal indicated what our current rates are that have been agreed upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| by the, by the union and local union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| And I can tell you that the 1620 is not, not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| It's closer to 20, I think, dollars an hour starting for a paramedic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| That's not what was in your, the information that was sent, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| I'd be happy to provide that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| Not paramedic. I'm talking about an EMT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| Oh, EMT. I'm sorry. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| I think that rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| depending on the classification of the EMT basic or advanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| that's probably the average, probably around 16 or so dollars an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| I think it's important that to know that there's also other incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| you know, nights and weekends, shift differentials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| and shift incentives and bonuses and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| Again, we agree that that number probably should be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7116)|
| 1:58:40| And part of the, and that was like Brett mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| part of the subsidy ask was really devoting a lot of that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| dollars back to the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| Thank you. I hope you will continue to look very closely at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| As you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| essentially you don't even have to be a high school graduate and you can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| $16 an hour working in a fast food restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7139)|
| 1:59:06| So I think if we're going to really attract and keep and nurture some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| these, especially entry-level folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| that we have got to keep working on getting that starting rate up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7154)|
| 1:59:21| So I would really encourage you to look hard at that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| And on that, I will turn the final question over to Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| Just a follow-up comment and then close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| We've heard a lot of great discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| a lot of things to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| especially as we move forward through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| And we've also heard a lot of discussion about positive outcomes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| productive paths forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| kind of hinging on the implementation of the County Medical Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| And as this discussion continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| I think we really need to look at this being a full-time employee because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| they have a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| And I just think that the County in general would benefit more from having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| a full-time medical director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| So I would ask that some consideration and continued discussion be had on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7210)|
| 2:00:15| that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7217)|
| 2:00:18| And seeing no other lights, we have run over slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| We appreciate everyone's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| And if I'm assuming we have any more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| we can certainly come to any of you individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-231102-health-dept-and-ems?start=7234)|
