| 0:00:10| Palmer. Vice Mayor Pavlis. Councilman Saunders. Councilman Steyer. Councilman Wallace. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=10)|
| 0:00:17| you. Do I have a motion to approve the minutes of the last meeting? All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=17)|
| 0:00:23| Thank you. We have quite a few items on the agenda tonight and some addendum items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=23)|
| 0:00:28| are very unusual so let's get started quickly. 4th and Gill neighborhood. 4th and Gill neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=28)|
| 0:00:34| special event permit. Would the person representing that group please come to the microphone and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=34)|
| 0:00:43| give us your name and address. Lori Mischke, 807 Gratz, Knoxville. Okay. Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=43)|
| 0:00:53| No record. Miss Dyer. File is complete. Okay. Do I hear a motion? Move to approve. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=53)|
| 0:01:01| a second? Second. All those in favor? Aye. Thank you. Now I did we did have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=61)|
| 0:01:06| sort of about the special events permit and we'll go ahead and approve this because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=66)|
| 0:01:11| got everything in but you do need to be sure you get the special event permit. If you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| used the new application that would have been part of it. Very good. Tell us about your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| event. It's not until October so we'll try to remember. The event is Arttoberfest and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| the idea is to do a fundraiser for the 4th and Gill neighborhood association with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| idea that we will not only be a historic neighborhood but also an art neighborhood. 10% of the profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=90)|
| 0:01:36| will go toward the installation of an art project in the neighborhood. 10% will also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| go through or go to a non-profit and then the rest will go to the maintenance of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=100)|
| 0:01:46| neighborhood and the idea is we will honor the Oktoberfest tradition with brats and beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| but then we will also have art installations. We will have an art gallery both at the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| across the street and also at the Birdhouse Neighborhood Association and then we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| have a raffle in relation to art projects throughout the neighborhood. Well this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| very ambitious and it sounds like a fun time and obviously October is a good time to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| out and have brats and beer so good luck with that. October 18th. Thank you. I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| neglect to mention that if your permit is approved tonight you can pick it up at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| end of this meeting for Ms. Day and if you're not approved, if it's approved pending, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| have to go to the business tax office when all the I's and T's are dotted and crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| Okay the next is Al's Market. Al's Market. Sadek Panjwani, 1006 University Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=154)|
| 0:02:46| Alright thank you. Sergeant Hunter. Mr. Panjwani has a conviction for annual alcohol training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| violation and he answered no to questions number 7 and 9 on the application. Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| Ms. Dyer. The file is complete. Alright before we hear a motion or entertain a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| on this, there are several options since Mr. Panjwani neglected, forgot, whatever to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| go to the renewal. So we're not going to quibble about why he did or didn't go. You have paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| your fine but you do still need to clear this with city court. So we have some options and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| Mr. Frost would you explain those options to us? Sure. Thank you Chairwoman. This gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=203)|
| 0:03:31| is, my understanding from an earlier conversation with Sergeant Hunter, he had been cited for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| not renewing his task class certification but on that very same day he took the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| class. Everything was done inside the safety building over behind the auditorium coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=223)|
| 0:03:52| What one possibility for the beer board is to consider is postponing this gentleman to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| perhaps the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting to allow him to go to city court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| and request that the judge reopen his case and pay fines and court costs and perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| be on, you know, probation for a certain period of time so that he would not have a conviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| because a lot of folks who are not lawyers, lay people, they don't realize if they go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| in and they pay something, pay the fine, pay the penalty, that can be seen as the equivalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=268)|
| 0:04:37| of a conviction. And if this was, if this gentleman was given the opportunity to reopen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=277)|
| 0:04:45| it, he might be able to address it that way. Any discussion on this? Yeah, I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| to ask something. Fire away. What happened? It sounds like it almost happened in reverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| order. You took the class or the test and then if you had paid the fine afterwards or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| something, maybe you would have been cleared. I'm not sure. How did this come about? Can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| you just give us a little background? I'm actually unaware of what exactly you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| are talking about, seriously. Okay. All right. Okay, maybe I can help. You didn't take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| class that you were supposed to take to renew your license, the test class. You didn't realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| that, went to take the class and pay the fine. So in many ways that was the right thing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| do, but there's just one more step and that is that you need to get your record cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| with city court. So what I would like to propose we do today is postpone this, defer it until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| the March 18th meeting, give you time to go to city court, straighten it out there, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| then we'll come back and reconsider this. Mr. Brown. You know where that is, the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| court? I know, but what I remember so far was the test class was, I already did the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| test class, paid the ticket. Right. Okay, so I have to go to city court and do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| So they can clean up your record because they don't know on their official records that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| you have paid the fine and taken the test class. They need to see you so that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=370)|
| 0:06:16| tell them I have done this. They'll check and it will clear it up. And why was it when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| I was not aware of anything, you know, nobody sent me any letter about it or anything like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| that and I'm here today to, you know. I understand that. Ms. Hunter, Sergeant Hunter, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| explain about the letters or not letters or how that works? When a person is convicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| in city court, unless we're called to testify if there's a contention and they hold the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| trial, we're not notified that there was a conviction. So until I performed the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| check in preparation for tonight's meeting, I didn't know you had this violation. Normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| when a permittee is out of compliance with the task requirement, we give first notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| a letter sent out saying that the requirement needs to be met and somebody needs to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| the class. And then about a month or so later, another letter is sent out. About a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| or so after that, if somebody still hasn't come to take the class, then we go out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| we give a citation to the permittee, which was you in this case. The day you came to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| take the class was the day you paid the ticket. And when you paid the ticket, it goes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| as a conviction. And therein lies the problem. Okay. Mr. Frost, would you help us out, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=441)|
| 0:07:29| Thank you. Sir, City Ordinance 4-37 is what's causing the issue. Your failure to take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| task class has run afoul of this particular ordinance. So you need to ask city court to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=457)|
| 0:07:46| reopen your file so you can address that short of being convicted. Because if you're convicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=466)|
| 0:07:54| you're not eligible to be a permittee. Once they reopen your file, they will see that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=474)|
| 0:08:02| in fact, taken the class and paid the fine. But it's just a matter, it's a processed paperwork piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| that the right and left hand aren't on the same page. So whose fault is it? I don't know whose fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| it is, and I'm not going to point fingers at anybody other than the fact that you've now met the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| requirements. It needs to be straightened out. I don't know how many letters you got, one, two, or none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| I never received any letter. Okay. Well, regardless of whether you received letters or not, you still need to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=509)|
| 0:08:37| this cleared up with the court so we can get the conviction removed so you can continue as manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| I will say that since Al's Market has been under his leadership, they've not had any citations for underage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| sales or other things. So they're good business citizens, and we like that part. Oh, I'm sorry. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| Yes, Madam Chair. I want to make a motion that we postpone this until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=537)|
| 0:09:06| Okay. And that will be March the 18th. Second. All right. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| Okay. So now, tomorrow or the next day, you need to get to city court and explain who you are and what's happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| and they will get this straightened out. Okay? Okay. All right. Thank you, sir. You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| All right. Chipotle Mexican Grill. Name and address, please. Pineo Cross, 204 Advantage Place, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=566)|
| 0:09:39| Okay. Sergeant Hunter. This cross has not been in for processing, and the task class has not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| Okay. Ms. Dyer. We need a copy of the sales tax registration, copy of their LLC, and the fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| Okay. We have been to this rodeo before with people who have not taken the task class, gotten their records checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| and we agreed at the workshop that we would defer action until the next beer board meeting, which would be March the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=599)|
| 0:10:08| Councilman Grieve, this is in your district. Yes. I make a motion that we postpone until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| Second. All those in favor? Aye. Okay. So on March the 18th, this will come before the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| and between now and then, you need to make sure you get to the task class. Okay? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| Clancy's Tavern and Whiskey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=627)|
| 0:10:40| It makes me thirsty. Name and address, please. Danny Clancy, 5313 Oak Blade Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=640)|
| 0:10:47| All right. Sergeant Hunter. Mr. Clancy and Mr. Turbeville have not been in for processing, and the task class has not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| Ms. Dyer. We need building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| So you're not ready for business yet, are you? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Okay. What is the anticipated opening date? We were shooting for the end of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| We were going to take the task class last Thursday, but the snow canceled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| Okay. All right. Well, you'll have plenty of time between now and March the 18th, which is the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| Okay. Assuming that we have a deferral on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| Councilman Brown, this is your decision. Yes. I'm going to move to postpone until the next scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry, Mr. Grieve, I did not see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| Still don't. Okay. Is there a second on that motion? All right. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| All right. Thank you. Good luck in getting this completed, and we'll see you March the 18th. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| The Dogwood Arts Festival. This is a two-event permit, Rhythm and Blooms, the beginning of the festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| and the arts fair at the end of the festival. Lisa Duncan, name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| Lisa Duncan, 8119 Greenwell Road, 37938. Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| No record, and the task class has not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| Ms. Dyer. The file is complete. Okay. I need to have a little conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=723)|
| 0:12:31| All right. The task class question is a question that's come up. They have used the old application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| We have not officially approved and blessed the new application until later in this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| so the task class is not an issue. Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| Yes, I just wanted the public to know that I'm a member of the board of Dogwood Arts Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| not receiving any monies from them, so I will be voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| I just wanted to be known that I am on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| All right. Thank you for making that clarification. Councilman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Would you explain your statement that the task force is not applicable to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| We have not previously required that special events folks take the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| The new application is straightening that out, as well as a couple of other pieces that were not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=794)|
| 0:13:22| So next year, there will be a little bit more to this, and I've already talked to Ms. Duncan about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Special events do not, as of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| Until after we vote tonight on the new application, so hold that thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=810)|

| 0:19:47| This is a different kind of permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| This is not a special event permit for the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1192)|

| 0:19:58| way for them to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1198)|

| 0:20:38| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| This is the first time I'm going to try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1239)|

| 0:21:20| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Ms. Mitani has not been in for processing, and the task force has not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1281)|

| 0:21:30| Our file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Going back to our discussion earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| So we should move to defer to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1295)|

| 0:21:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Until you complete that task class, we can't give you the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| So be there and have it done by March the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Did the Elite Youth Baseball show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| When is their event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| March the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Why the sudden outbreak on no task class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| Was there a snow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| There's never been a requirement that people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Why the outbreak on so many people missing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| We hadn't had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| The snow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Well, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| This Elite Youth Baseball doesn't have a complete application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| When's their event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| March the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| There is no next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| So there is no next meeting prior to their event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| I guess they're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Sounds dry, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| If there's no motion, this will die from lack of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| Hearing no motion, this application is not in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Now let's look at some of the other things that we have on this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| We need to hear from the Quick Stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| They were approved subject to final documentation on November 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| Registered letter was sent on January 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| I'm Brenda from the Quick Stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Tell us about your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Well, the owner thought that we would close on the 30th of November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| but he didn't give us the paperwork we needed until the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| so our loan didn't go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| So we need an extension because then he backed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| then his lawyer called us, and he wants to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| How long do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| What kind of an extension do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| Because this is quite abnormal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Well, right now the lawyers are negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| It's in the lawyers' hands at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| But we're hoping in the next month it will close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1430)|
| 0:24:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| After conferring with Mr. Frost, if we give you 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| that's the most that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| And then if you get this done sooner than 60 days and go to Ms. Dyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| then you'll get your permit and be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| So I need a motion from someone to defer this to the extend, rather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| to the April 15th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| The ayes dotted, the ayes crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| And you need to be in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Next is the Viet Taste Incorporated on North Peter's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| I would like to extend for another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Have you been opened yet or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Not yet because we wait for the Health Department coming down to do inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| The problem is from the outside, the grease trap, it damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| Now we have to replace the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| And that's very understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Councilman Grieve, I think this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Do you want to extend to March 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| I move we postpone or extend for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1512)|

| 0:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140218?start=1518)|
