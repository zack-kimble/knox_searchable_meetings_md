| 0:03:11| this latest mass shootings were longtime public works professionals, engineers and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| staff, and people who worked on different aspects of building infrastructure in Virginia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| Beach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=202)|

| 0:03:28| public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| The tragedy is heartbreaking and totally senseless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| The City of Virginia Beach has a website, and it is loveforvb.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| That's L-O-V-E-F-O-R-V-B dot com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=219)|

| 0:03:56| Council, I wanted to share with people in the audience and watching at home on CTV where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| we're at in our recode Knoxville deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| I must compliment my colleagues for sticking through the nine and a half hour meeting recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=246)|
| 0:04:13| and continue to press forward with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| This is a comprehensive update of Knoxville's zoning ordinance that we have not touched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| in over half a century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| The aim of Recode Knoxville has always been to promote development in a way that protects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| our community assets and uses resources efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| We're trying to come up with a document that's a guide for encouraging walkable communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| economic opportunity and a high quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| At the same time, we've been careful to protect the rights of property owners, and in many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| cases, expand the options that owners have for how they may use and enjoy their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| Unfortunately, there recently has been a great deal of misunderstanding and muddying of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| waters on social media and in some mainstream media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| This is not a massive rezoning, nor have these deliberations been conducted in any way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| has not been fully public and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| There have been close to 90 Recode public meetings and a mailing went to every city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| property owner, alerting him or her to the process that's underway and encouraging engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=321)|
| 0:05:29| Every comment and edit of the draft ordinance is getting posted to RecodeKnoxville.com,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=329)|

| 0:06:23| comparing it with a map that is equivalent to existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| Of course, council members who represent specific districts will be taking an especially close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| look at what's being proposed in their district with backup from at-large council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| The draft ordinance and the map will each come back before council for more deliberation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| and eventually two final votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=404)|

| 0:14:28| I just wanted to bring to everyone's attention that June is National Gun Violence Awareness Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| and so gun violence is the second leading cause of death among children and teens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| And so gun violence awareness believes that more can be done to save lives from gun violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| due to one simple thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| And so Friday, June the 7th, is National Wear Orange Day against gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| And so when asked why orange, the answer to that question is that hunters wear orange in the woods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=895)|
| 0:15:04| to protect themselves and others from harm, and so orange does express a collective hope as a nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| a hope for a future free from gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| And so if you so choose, we encourage everyone to please let others know that Friday is Wear Orange Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| for National Gun Violence Awareness Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=918)|

| 0:19:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Becky, I'm going to ask you to ask a few questions about A and B here, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| This is a continuation of a program that we've been using, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Yeah, this program's been in place since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| It was originally funded with federal stimulus money, HPRP funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| and it's to provide case management services in four of the KCDC high-rises that house elderly disabled individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1177)|
| 0:19:48| and it helps to prevent homelessness by intervening if there are any issues with housing stability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1188)|
| 0:19:58| whether that's behavioral or rent payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| And it's been very, very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| Do you have some stats that would point us towards that success?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| Are there some key stats that say, yeah, this is how we're measuring success?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| And it's been on now for 11 years, so I'm sure you have a good bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| I'm going to ask Misty Goodwin of CAC to come up and give that information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Misty, when you get there, if you would please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| Hello, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| I'm Misty Goodwin with CAC, as Becky said, and my address is 6729 Bonneville Drive out in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1230)|
| 0:20:37| And I brought statistics for this past year, and I can get the statistics for all the years we've been doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| We do have great statistics, but I do not have all those pulled together for you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| But in the last year, which are just since July 1st of 2018 through March 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| we have served 443 individuals who were referred to us by management who were at risk of being evicted for one reason or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1254)|
| 0:21:01| and that could be because of behavior, because they didn't pay rent, just unauthorized house guests, just fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1261)|
| 0:21:11| It just depends on the many things that could come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| But out of those 443 residents in this past year, 23 of those ended up with an eviction being set out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1274)|
| 0:21:22| and out of those 23, there were only three that we did not get into housing, alternative housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| and that was simply because they didn't want to participate with us at the end to come up with a housing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| So it's a very successful project, and the whole goal there is to reduce the folks cycling in and out of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| What we know, and I run several other programs at Homeward Bound that we do rehousing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| putting people in subsidized housing is something that we want to make sure they make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| And then at these particular high-rises, we have a lot of folks who were formerly homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| so it's really a win-win for us to be able to work with those individuals and those residents to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| once they're placed in housing, they stay stably housed, just to reduce the numbers that are out there on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| And so it really has been a very effective program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| I'll be happy to get you statistics for the whole time we've been working under this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| but quite frankly, usually every year we've had less than three people that have ended up without housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| And I was just talking to our executive director yesterday about how it's really impressive statistics in the work that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| but folks are working with us and we're doing the best we can to keep folks housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| You're basically just an advocate there on site for them to work through they're facing eviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| or they're facing some misplaced housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| and you're there as an advocate for them to make sure that they either get rehoused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| or that their situation gets heard and settled in a fair manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Right, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| And we've also used resources that CAC has through funding streams that come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| when people can't pay their rent or they get in a bind or they get behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| We've also been able to use our funding that is in addition to what we have from you all to pay for the cost of our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1379)|
| 0:23:06| But we pay for rent to keep people housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| We start a new project that is raising donations of housekeeping items and cleaning supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| so people can keep their apartments clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| We connect and use other partner agencies with mental health services that when we need to connect them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| or recovery services, we've even paid to transport people to recovery when that's something that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| When there's unwelcome guests or formerly homeless people staying with somebody, putting them at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| we'll work with that individual to find them housing so they're not keeping that person at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| So we also have brought in several recovery groups to the actual high rises that we've been facilitating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| and providing meals and food for the residents to come and participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| That's real good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| I just, Ms. Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| I just had one question on something you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| but I wanted to say that I think this wraparound service is one of the most important components of our housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| to kind of keep people from falling out of their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| You said something about alternative housing, like the 23 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| I don't remember what the number was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| You cited something about alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| What are the alternatives for those who end up not being able to stay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| Or you get them into sober living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| I mean, what are the alternatives you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Typically we try to find them other affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| which quite frankly would be some of the not so great places to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| that will take folks that have been evicted from subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| Sometimes that might be occasionally families that are willing to take them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| Sometimes it's been seniors that simply just can't take care of themselves any longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| and can't keep up with their apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| And so we would move them in, sometimes into nursing facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| A lot of times many of the folks we work with, that is the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| But typically really just being creative and trying to work with landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| and keep a pool of landlords that would be willing to work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| to take people who are really sometimes hard to house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| It might be a halfway house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Sometimes it's people that need to go back maybe to where they originally came to Knoxville from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| or they've got relatives in another city or state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| and we would be willing to send them to move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| First I want to thank Councilman Wallace for asking that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| because I think a lot of times people don't understand the additional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| and what goes into keeping a person out of chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| or getting back into that cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| And so I want to commend the work that you and your team do, your staff do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| to help assist these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| And I want to be very specific that these are elderly and or disabled individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| And so it is very difficult for a person who has been homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| to transition back into structured living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| That within itself is very traumatic for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| You would think being homeless is traumatic, but there are people who get into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| That becomes their normal and their environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| And so it does take a team of people to help them to be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| in being able to maintain affordable and stable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| And so I just wanted to thank you for coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| And thank you again, Councilman Wallace, for asking that for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| I'll be sure to pass that along to our case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| We've had folks that have been in place for a long time with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| and they've worked really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1583)|

| 0:26:52| Yeah, so back to Ms. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| Similar questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Just how we got here and then what kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| Yeah, this program is much newer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| This is an early diversion program specifically for people who are engaged in prostitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| It's a way for them to divert going to jail to get services that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| whether that's substance abuse, mental health counseling, case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| things like that, to help them change their lifestyle, get off the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| get off substances, and then make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1642)|
| 0:27:30| Candace Allen is here from Helen Ross McNabb if you want to hear more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| Ms. Allen, when you come up, would you please give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| My name is Candace Allen, 310 Wooded Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| It's kind of the same question to you, Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Are there some key statistics that you all have from the past year that indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| what kind of effectiveness you're having with this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| In the past year, we've served about 38 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| And when you look at this population, it's very difficult to engage someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| It's almost a subpopulation of a subpopulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| So that's actually quite a surprising number that we have actively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| that we're working with right now and doing outreach with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| We know that we have had an 88% reduction in arrests for these women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1711)|
| 0:28:39| We have had a seven of them have gone into treatment, alcohol treatment and drug treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1719)|
| 0:28:47| One of the most, I think, surprising statistics to me that we just kind of put together today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| is that 12 of these ladies have left their, for lack of a better word, their johns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| which is a very difficult thing to, you know, help someone exit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| There's a whole lot of trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Most probably about 95% of these individuals have a significant trauma history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| So we're able to help them get into counseling, substance abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| and the fact that they're able to get out of that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| that that's just kind of a never-ending circle for them is really huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| So those are some of the statistics that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| We're also tracking jail days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Of course, the number of arrests have gone down 88%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| but we're also tracking, we don't have that year yet benchmark data for the reduction in jail days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| but we're looking probably at about 40% reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| even in the number of days that they're there when they are arrested so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| Good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1793)|

| 0:31:50| There's a motion and a second, but before we have any comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| I would like to ask Mark Walker from KUB to explain this item and the next two items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| and kind of what our responsibility is relative to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| Mark Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| I live at 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| I am the CFO of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Vice Mayor Saunders, members of Council, we certainly do appreciate your consideration of the proposed bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| that are before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| As you can see, we do have three resolutions that KUB has been placed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| They're all related to the issuance of long-term revenue bonds to help fund our various utility system capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| By resolution, there's $17 million that we're requesting for the electric system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| $26 million for the water system, and $20 million for the wastewater system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| The proceeds of each series of bonds will be used solely to fund capital investments in our utility system infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1960)|
| 0:32:48| You all may be aware of our Century 2 utility infrastructure programs that we began back in 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| to help ensure reliable electric, water, wastewater, and gas service for all of KUB's customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| That is the intent for these bonds to help continue to fund those Century 2 programs for each of those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| The bonds will mature over a period of 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| They are long-term bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Debt is a key component of our long-term funding plans for Century 2 for each of our four systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| Debt helps spread the cost out over both current and future customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| since the assets that we're funding with these bonds are long-lived fixed assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| and so both current and future customers will benefit from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| So we use debt to help fund the investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Our total capital budget for the upcoming fiscal year is $211 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| So at $63 million, debt will fund about 30% in total of our utility system capital investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| I do want to point out that the bonds are secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| The repayment of the bonds are secured solely by KUB system revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| which means that the city has no obligation whatsoever for the repayment of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| So that's sort of a high-level summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| Don't go away just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| There are several comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2059)|

| 0:34:26| One thing I've heard a lot about complaints and I have concerns myself is the rising of fixed fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| Could you talk about that in relationship to how that money is used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| Is that used to pay these capital expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| What is the plan for KUB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I mean, are those fees going to continue to rise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| And the reason why I'm concerned about it is, you know, as the fixed part of the bill rises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| that has more of an adverse income on lower income people because they typically have smaller homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2093)|
| 0:34:59| and a bigger portion of their bill would be the fixed part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| And the other problem is that if more of the revenues come from the fixed part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| there's less incentives to, you know, modernize and reduce, you know, invest in energy efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| So as we, you know, I guess that was last meeting we talked about reducing our carbon footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| And so I want to make sure we're, you know, having those incentives are right through our KUB pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| So if you could talk a bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| Sure. You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Each of our residential customers, our residential rates, has both a fixed cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| or a fixed charge component and a usage component on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| And those levels have been set by our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| Over the last several years, as we've had rate increases to help fund our Century II programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| I guess starting back in 2011, our board has elected to put the rate increase on the fixed monthly charge to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2150)|
| 0:35:59| Because those Century II investments, which the rate increases are helping to fund, benefit all customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| we've tried to do it in a balanced way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| When you look, for example, at residential electric service for an average residential electric customer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| that fixed fee, which is $19 currently, represents about 20% of the total bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| So there is a large portion of the bill that can still be managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| The usage can be managed down through various energy efficiency improvements that customers would want to invest in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| Right. I guess my question is, I mean, is that money, it's just revenue for KUB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| It's revenue for KUB, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| And so they could put it in the fixed side or the rate side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| It could be in the usage side or the fixed side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| What we try to do is balance it out because, as I mentioned, we have a $211 million capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| But those are really fixed assets, so most of that is fixed cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| So we have to recover a portion of that fixed cost, and our board has designed the rates or set the rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| They would like for a portion of each customer to pay a fixed amount as well as a variable amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| In terms of has the board or the KUB administration going forward talked about trying to cap the fixed part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| or has there been any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| We are beginning discussions with our board later this summer, early fall, what we view rates, rate structures going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| So we'll be having those discussions with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| They have not made any firm decision yet on how future rate increases would be applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| but we'll be having those discussions here in the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| We're beginning those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| I'll be happy to pass your comments along to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Those are my concerns, the adverse impact on our low-income residents who pay a greater percent of their bill is fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| and then the environmental impacts and the incentives of a higher fixed portion versus a variable part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| I would like to point out, if I might, we do have a number of programs at KUB that are designed to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2277)|
| 0:38:05| and to benefit the lower-income customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| We obviously have our project help program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| We also have our Roundup program, which you're probably familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| which goes for weatherization of low-income housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| which is really fundamental to the problem that we have with energy efficiency here in the communities that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| And so we have raised, along with TVA, which gave us a large amount several years ago through the KEEM project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2305)|
| 0:38:34| we've been able to help weatherize a number of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| and really address the core problem with energy efficiency for many of our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| We also are in the process of having energy efficiency workshops throughout our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| We are promoting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| We've had actually, I think, met with over 200 customers in the last couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| to promote and give out energy and water efficiency kits for those customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| So we're very, we share in your concern about energy efficiency and water efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2340)|
| 0:39:07| and we have a number of programs that we've developed that are in progress to help address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I'd like to build onto what Councilman Stair was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| There is the low-income aspect, but there's also the efficiency aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| and I brought my KUB bill in with me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| And the reason I did is that you guys will be amazed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| My usage charges last month were $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| Had the windows open, hung my laundry outside to dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| I worked really hard to be efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| My fixed charges were about $80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| I mean, this is for all of the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| For all four services combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| So I used $15 worth but paid $95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| My neighbor, who's got their air conditioning on all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| and I'm sure they're, you know, drying their clothes through the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| their bill was only $80 more than mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| You know, for a couple dollars a day, I could not worry about efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| But when people are working really hard, and it's an issue that the whole city is working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| and then, you know, climate changes, there's so many different reasons for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| this doesn't encourage me to be more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| It's like, oh, it's already $80 just to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| Or if I leave my house, go on vacation, I'm still paying that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| And I understand that KUB has fixed costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| but I think it would only take a little bit of creative accounting to add on to the usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| I mean, even if my usage was doubled by 100%, which I am not suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| my bill would be $30 instead of $95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| So it's something that I know that this came before Mr. Bolas came to KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2452)|
| 0:40:59| but it's something that I really hope that the board will consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| and I'm thinking about coming out to the board meeting later on this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| Sure. I'll be happy to pass your concerns on to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| I would just like you to add my name to Councilman Stair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| and Councilwoman Singh's concerns to the KUB board as it relates to our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| And I'm fully aware of the services that KUB has in place to assist low-income residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| Probably 80% of the calls that I receive are regarding KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| and people's inability to pay their KUB bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| And so I do know there's a social worker that's available as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| and I do understand that a lot of the programs that you have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| go to help pay the cost for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| However, it is concerning, and I've already raised this to your board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| the fact that a person who is unable to pay their bill is charged $8 or $9 to get a pink slip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| letting them know that their utilities are going to be turned off on top of a late fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| So if you would please add that to the concerns as well, I would certainly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Could you just explain what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| You have to pay $8 to $9, the pink slip part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| When your utilities are going to be turned off because you haven't paid it by a certain date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| and they bring a slip out and hang it on your door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| it is bright pink so a person will see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| so they know and they're aware that if you don't pay by 5 o'clock this date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| your utilities will be turned off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| They are charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| To get it turned back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| No, yes, and they're charged for that pink slip to be hung on their door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| So they're fined for being noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| There is a cost associated with going out and delivering that notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| and it's just that charge is designed to recover that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| I just wanted to end with, I mean, we're all just like throwing things at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| I do appreciate KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| I like turning on my AC and then having it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| And I know it's a very difficult balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| And then the relationship that it has with the city is somewhat interconnected and then not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| But I would like to, I had talked with Mr. Polish yesterday about if it would behoove the city or KUB to try to be more connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2594)|
| 0:43:24| And it seems like people were feeling it's set, it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| I don't know if that's further conversations we should have or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2608)|

| 0:46:13| I know we would like to ask Jim York to come forward and expand on this just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2773)|
| 0:46:22| Councilman Wallace, since you've got your light on, you can get the first question if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Jim York, Finance Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| Take it away, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Tell us how we got to $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| As you may recall, a year ago you passed a budget that anticipated the issuance of just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| shy of $55 million in new debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| The budget that you passed, I think, two weeks ago also anticipated the borrowing of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| roughly $6.7 million in debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| What you have before you tonight is kind of the first step in that process of borrowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| and this is an initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| One of the things about an initial resolution is that we set caps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2827)|
| 0:47:15| and we want those caps to be higher than actually what we anticipate that we will borrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| Those caps reset the amount that we can borrow, the interest rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| maximum interest rate at which we can borrow, and the type of projects that we can borrow for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| And so we have set the anticipated amounts much higher than what we actually expected to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2852)|
| 0:47:42| If we have no changes in there, we should end up borrowing about $62.575 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2862)|
| 0:47:52| My guess is that interest rates, if they stay the same, would be in the probably low 3% range next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2872)|
| 0:48:01| Now, again, the actual borrowing will not take place probably for at least until later this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2881)|
| 0:48:10| and more likely it will run into next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| That's because we intend to cash flow most of our startup costs and so forth prior to actual borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2894)|
| 0:48:23| We will not borrow until we reach a certain point, and that's to avoid the paying of interest on that debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| because once you borrow, you begin paying interest from that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| The other thing that this does is this, again, starts a 20-day clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2915)|
| 0:48:42| during which there can be a petition filed if there are sufficient signatures to request a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2922)|
| 0:48:52| That's the first thing that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| But, again, there will be several more actions before the actual borrowing takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| We will also have to receive state approval on the specifics of the proposed bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| Again, that will probably not occur until, again, next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| Will it all be consolidated into one note, or will it be different notes for different projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Will the votes that we'll take from here on out be just on this $70 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| What you will have here, again, this just sets the outside limits or the caps that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2967)|
| 0:49:34| If you try to exceed those caps, you basically start the process over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| When we go out and, you know, actually borrow the money, we will probably issue an aggregate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| so we'll have a listing of projects, again, that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| We'll hone these figures down and come to a much, much tighter range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| and we'll have a better idea on where the market is going to go at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| So if it comes in less, can you add projects that are not mentioned here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| I mean, if it comes in and you don't need $70 million, you've got an extra $5 million, can you add that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| You could theoretically add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| Again, those would have to be budgeted projects, so you'd have to go through that kind of budget process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| You can't go over $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| We cannot go over $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| We can borrow less than $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| We can borrow less than $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| We can actually borrow zero, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| So if you pay money out of cash flow for the initial set, do you pay yourself back for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| I think it was last July or so, you actually pass a resolution of intent to repay ourselves from those bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3038)|
| 0:50:46| As I recall, that resolution of intent is basically capped at $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| So once we get up close to $40 million, we are probably going to go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| and that's about the point at where we will actually initiate the borrowing because, again, that also set a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3054)|
| 0:51:03| So if we were to spend $50 million before we borrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| we can only repay ourselves $40 million or whatever the resolution of intent allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| And that's a 30-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| These will probably be 20-year bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Talk a little bit about the city's debt policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| and once we do borrow this money where that sort of puts us in terms of our outstanding debt and our capacity going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3087)|
| 0:51:37| Currently, we have about $152 million in outstanding debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3097)|
| 0:51:50| If nothing else happens, if we don't borrow until next year, by the end of June 30, 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3110)|
| 0:51:58| we will have paid off an additional roughly $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3118)|
| 0:52:04| You add this on, so let's say we borrow 62 prior to June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| Our actual debt would go up another $50 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| We think that that's a manageable level of debt, that it would not significantly affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| In fact, we don't expect that it would affect our bond ratings at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| We would be consistent with our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| Our policies set out certain thresholds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| It's about how much debt we will retire within a 12-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| For example, we have a policy that says we will basically pay down 50% of outstanding principal within a 12-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3158)|
| 0:52:46| So, again, we will follow all those policies in actually structuring the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3166)|
| 0:52:55| And then, again, like I said, the state has to approve it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| It does allow us flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| We can change some of the projects if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| But, again, I have a feeling I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| You've got additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| No, I think in terms of additional capacity after that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| is it how sort of close to the limit are we in terms of going over those guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| Well, I mean, honestly, I think if you came back and said we need to borrow another $200 million, yeah, we'd probably have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3204)|
| 0:53:32| If you come back and say we need to borrow another $10 million, $10 million, $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| we'd have to take a look at the structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| But, again, I don't think that would significantly impact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3219)|
| 0:53:46| So somewhere between $20 and $200?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Yeah, probably somewhere between $20 and $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| The real question is, again, on any issuance of debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| what you have is you're basically going to have a fixed cost that you're going to have to satisfy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3236)|
| 0:54:04| and that could affect what your flexibility is on other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| because basically you're now plugging in a fixed dollar amount into your budget that you didn't have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| Okay, and so that would be more of the concern than the actual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| I mean, to me, that's the significant thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| You do everything in context of what everything else that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3270)|

| 0:57:13| Yeah, I just wanted to make a couple of comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| and call on Ms. Brooks maybe to elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| I think it's really important to note some of the comments that are in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| both for this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| It is not specific to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| I would like to say I'm excited to see how this project develops out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| I actually want to make a couple of comments to make sure the public and for the public record notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| There's a lot of conversation about the process of recode that we're going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| and that we have ample zoning to do the projects that are needed in the near downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| And this particular agenda item and the next one are both examples of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| slash near downtown zoned areas that are being rezoned to C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| because that's a crutch zoning that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| And if you look at the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| if those who are at home viewing or who are out in the audience were to read the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| it talks about the 2014 mixed-use plan that talks about the zoning that's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| and that this isn't adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Ms. Brooks, do you want to elaborate on that a little bit more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| Sure, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| So C2, although not perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| It's what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| It's what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| It's the only option available in our current code for property owners to continue to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| or renovate existing older properties or buildings near downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| Like Central and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| Central and Broadway, good examples of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| So, you know, as interest in the redevelopment expands outside of our city's downtown core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3525)|
| 0:58:53| along these major corridors there is a need for some type of transition zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| We recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| And essentially that is what you'll read in the background of the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| And so we see a need for this transition zone from this higher-intensity center city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| into some of these mixed-use corridors that have a lot of adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| And so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| And for those who are interested, I would recommend reading the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| and reading the MPC packets and sheets on these particular agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| because it talks about the inadequacy of C2, and that's all we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| In the absence of giving some of these buildings a zoning code that addresses their lack of parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| because that's how they were built, folks were riding the trolley cars to get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| the only other option you have to put these buildings back into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| is to demolish properties around them and create parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| That's one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| But one of the reasons that it's a shortcoming of a zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| is because it doesn't take into consideration any of the surrounding properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| whether it be residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| So it doesn't have step-back effects for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| It's unlimited height, so someone could, with the C2 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| we've clustered a lot of C2 zoning in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| If it stayed as it is, you could come and tear things down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| and build the next unlimited skyscraper there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| And that's not, you know, really compatible with the neighborhoods there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| or the infrastructure that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| So I just want to address that misnomer running around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| that we have an adequate zoning code that works for all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| because we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| We've been hobbling along and trying to patch it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| And so anyway, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| It's an educational opportunity to air what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| and how we've been going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| And these comments date back to a minimum of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| And I'm excited about this project to see how it unfolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3651)|
| 1:00:52| Are there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| If not, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3653)|

| 1:01:28| It does have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Council, that is the end of our formal agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| We do have two people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| First is Kent Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| Kent, if you would please approach the podium and give us your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| Now, our five-minute timer doesn't work tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| so when there's one minute left, I will let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Yeah, my name is Kent Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| I live at 311 West Glenwood Avenue in historic North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| I wanted to comment on the conversation that you all had about fixed fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| and I'm so glad that City Councilwoman Singh has brought her bill that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| the disproportionate impact on low-income consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| By rights, City Council should exercise oversight over KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| Over 3,000 petitions, Mr. Walker didn't mention this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| but they've been delivered to the commissioners of KUB as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| Southern Alliance for Clean Energy's Freeze the Fees campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| So far, no action has been taken by the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| and as Mr. Walker pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| it's probably because they're worried about their fixed costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| especially since there's a steady decline in electrical utility consumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Utility customers are getting smarter and more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| And here's where we can see the bad economics in these ever-growing fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| To use the language of Adam Smith, one of the founders of modern economics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| he says the fees punish the intelligently parsimonious consumer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| The fees are a small part of the bill for someone who consumes a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| but a big percentage for a citizen struggling to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| Adam Smith advises policymakers to charge more for the wastefully profligate consumer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3806)|
| 1:03:34| Put the squeeze on that guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| Now, a year ago I lived in Los Angeles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| and in Los Angeles they have a tiered system of rates and no fixed fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| and the tiered system gives a lower rate to people who use a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| and then once your consumption exceeds a certain amount, you go into level two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| which is a moderate rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| and if you really are just turning on the air conditioner while the windows open on a hot day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| well, then you go into level three and you pay through the nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| But what this does is it enables the utility to recover its fixed costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| We all want KUB to meet the fixed costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| We don't want to have a pay cut for the people who come out and fix a downed wire in a rainstorm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| but it's very important that those not be disproportionately settled onto the shoulders of our most vulnerable people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3862)|
| 1:04:31| Now, I, as an advocate for the Sierra Club in Los Angeles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| I know many of the people in L.A. who helped set those rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| John Chang, the chief financial officer, David Jaco, their energy efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| If any of you would like my help in connecting you with those people, I'd be glad to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3882)|
| 1:04:49| I'm Kent Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| I volunteer with the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Thanks for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Next is Laura Humphrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3895)|
| 1:05:03| Ms. Humphrey, please give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Once again, I will warn you at the one-minute mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| My name is Laura Humphrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| I live at 328 Tulewa Drive in South Knoxville, and I am a KUV customer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| Thank you, council and vice mayor, for the opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| Following Seema's comments about her KUV bill, I thought I could offer some supporting information on mandatory fixed fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| I work with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, located here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| promoting clean, safe, and healthy communities through our energy choices in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| And while I have only been with SACE for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| our organization has been working our community and our region for 33 years as a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| Let me start by saying that your energy bill is made up of three parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| So you have your usage rate, you have your household kilowatt-hour usage, plus any mandatory fixed fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| KUV sets the usage fees based on what TVA rates are and the mandatory monthly fees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| From the usage side of the bill, let me say that the usage side is near and dear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| For one, that's the only part of the bill that customers can actually control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| So some customers, like Seema, she's a really good example of a KUV customer who monitors behaviors to conserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| That's the first step in lowering your utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| But other customers may choose to do weatherization or energy efficiency upgrades to help lower their bills as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| That is near and dear to me, like I mentioned, because I did work on the KEEM program here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| and that great investment from multiple organizations into our community saw great benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=3994)|
| 1:06:40| even beyond the energy conservation side, but also into health benefits and other non-energy benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4000)|
| 1:06:48| So I would like to point out that research shows that low-income customers in the TVA system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| typically use 10% less than the average of all households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4012)|
| 1:06:59| When a household spends a large portion of its income on energy costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| it's said to have a high energy burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| Groups that tend to have higher burdens, despite sometimes lower usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| include racial minorities, low-income households, multifamily apartment dwellers, and renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4029)|
| 1:07:17| Some of the other things that you need to know about statistics is that we also have what is called low-usage groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| These are your elderly, your low-income, fixed-income, single-resident households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| They all tend to be low-usage users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| And anybody who is also interested in renewables or energy efficiency is included in this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| Here in Knoxville, some of our households pay over 18% of their income towards energy costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| so their energy burden is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Anything over 6% is considered high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| High mandatory fixed fees are the other part of the high bill equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| Mandatory fixed fees is the portion of the bill that the customer has no control of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| and they have to pay this before they even flip on the first light switch in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| I think that Mr. Walker also pointed out that they are attempting to be fair in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| but it doesn't matter the size of your household, the size of your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| Everybody actually pays the same fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| Seema also pointed out that, you know, her neighbor and her are very different in their behaviors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| but yet they're paying the same fixed fees and very different usage charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| So while fixed fees have increased, the demand for electricity is actually flat or declining, like Kent pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| KUB customers, like Seema, are using less electricity or conserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| but have not seen their bills decrease accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| KUB's mandatory fee was $6 in 2010, and I would like to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| at the same time that the fee started to increase, there was actually a decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| They actually decreased the energy rate, which does not promote conservation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| So it's $19 today, and it's going to rise to $20.50 in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| So KUB's monthly mandatory fees have increased dramatically and unjustifiably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| because there are other methods that could be used to collect revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| While SASE does not oppose KUB collecting revenue needed to provide us in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| Humphrey, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| Okay. We agree with Seema and over 3,000 others here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| that the methods to set rates should be less regressive and support energy conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| to help lower bills and promote cleaner, safer, and healthy communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| This is closely tied to our housing affordability issue in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| and definitely to our state, we are actually ranked seventh highest for utility bills in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Thank you, Ms. Humphrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| That is all we have, counsel, and we will stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| Thank you so much for a short meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190604?start=4186)|
