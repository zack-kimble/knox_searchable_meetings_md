| 2:33:27| to the coordinated entry system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| but it is telling us something about the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| Those are my points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9213)|
| 2:33:34| And I'm available for any questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9214)|
| 2:33:41| And I hope I wasn't frozen the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| Unmuted, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9222)|
| 2:33:43| Councilman Smith, I think I saw your hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| Did you still have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9227)|
| 2:33:48| Just to, Chris, can you repeat something I think I heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9228)|
| 2:33:52| Earlier, we saw the names of almost 100 agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| that were involved in this very critical, important cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9236)|
| 2:34:01| but we only see four access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| Can you just clarify that any of those other agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| that were involved in this can bring someone to those four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9247)|
| 2:34:11| So again, we identified these three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| primary designated access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| with the street outreach doing some level on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9256)|
| 2:34:21| Those three agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| those are gonna be the largest providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| for BMC for individuals, CAC for youth and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| and then VOA for veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| We wanna make sure that anyone can get a CHAMP intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| We don't wanna send someone across town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| If they come into our building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9278)|
| 2:34:40| and they are in housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| we don't wanna send them to CAC across town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9283)|
| 2:34:46| because they're a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| So I've trained a number of agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| just to be able to do the intake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9290)|
| 2:34:51| and just to be able to do the referral to case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9291)|
| 2:34:54| So we've really had a concerted effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| in making sure that more were trained than fewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9297)|
| 2:35:01| But those are the primary designated access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| But just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| the partners we're getting ready to hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| who aren't on that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| can send or bring or liaise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| with these three primary entry points, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9311)|
| 2:35:14| And we want them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9314)|
| 2:35:15| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| Beyond just offering a pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9317)|
| 2:35:18| we also want, I mean, this is a way to capture information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9318)|
| 2:35:25| about who's experiencing homelessness right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9325)|
| 2:35:28| in our community and those specific needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9328)|
| 2:35:31| and can educate our stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| as to what we need to do to build on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| and provide for this population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| Yeah, I can't applaud this enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| I mean, there are different points in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| that there were capacity problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| there were outreach problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| and there was coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| And this definitely made a big dent in the coordination gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| And I'm just to add while I'm at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| the council approved more outreach workers at BMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| that helped with the outreach gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| and the capacity challenge still lies ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| So thank you for all you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| Councilman, this is Mike here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9366)|
| 2:36:07| I just want to interject one additional thing about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| And that is coordinated entry systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| started out as a requirement of HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| for the HUD funded programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9378)|
| 2:36:21| And so we have started with the HUD funded programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| but we are working to build that system out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9386)|
| 2:36:30| and work with other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| I know we've been talking with CARM, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| about starting to do some additional entries for veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| that they have come through their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| So there's work to begin to expand this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9403)|
| 2:36:47| so that we have this as a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| to help people find a clear pathway through the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| wherever they end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| Continue to improve it because even some of these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| I know these three are not open all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9416)|
| 2:36:59| and different days are available for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| So resources are stretched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9422)|
| 2:37:05| and we need to continue working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9425)|
| 2:37:08| So thanks, Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| Yeah, and in the end, we want, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| what Chris called a no wrong door policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| We want an individual to hit any agency in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| and be funneled toward the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9438)|
| 2:37:20| And that's our goal moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9440)|
| 2:37:22| is to create that system, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| I have a follow up question for Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9451)|
| 2:37:34| Chris, how long is the average stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9454)|
| 2:37:37| in permanent supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| You know, I think the terminology makes it sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| like it's, you know, endless, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| but it really just refers to a unspecified period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9466)|
| 2:37:52| that you're gonna be able to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9472)|
| 2:37:55| It's not limited to a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| That's the hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9479)|
| 2:38:00| The hope is that it is permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9480)|
| 2:38:01| You know, as long as the person wants to live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| and needs that support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| the hope is that it is exactly as it's titled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9486)|
| 2:38:10| And if you think about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| who we're serving within the context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9494)|
| 2:38:15| we're picking the most vulnerable homeless individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| We're sliding them into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9501)|
| 2:38:22| They're probably going to need that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9502)|
| 2:38:25| Until they're in, I mean, as long as they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9505)|
| 2:38:29| So that's the hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9509)|
| 2:38:30| We want it to be permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9510)|
| 2:38:31| We want it to be something that works for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| Well, it doesn't end up being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| I mean, it sounded like you were giving us a pipeline of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| you know, there's so many people coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| so many people leaving, so many people coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9523)|
| 2:38:46| so many people leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| And obviously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| what we're hearing a lot is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| but I was just wondering if there's a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9532)|
| 2:38:55| a typical length of stay that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9535)|
| 2:38:59| and maybe where folks go afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| or, you know, how many folks stay there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| You know, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9545)|
| 2:39:06| the goal is that there's always a safe place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| I don't know if there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| and if you don't have that in front of you, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| We can look at that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| I'm sure everyone would be interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| But I'm just wondering if there's a typical length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9557)|
| 2:39:20| of stay that you see and maybe where folks go afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9560)|
| 2:39:23| I don't know if there's a typical length of stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| that you see and maybe where folks go afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| I'm sure everyone would be interested in seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| what those numbers look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9570)|
| 2:39:32| And we do have some Permanent Supportive Housing providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| here that may be able to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| during their portions of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| But that's something that we can access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| It's just not in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9581)|
| 2:39:42| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9582)|
| 2:39:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9583)|
| 2:39:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9584)|
| 2:39:46| Hey, Sean, really quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9586)|
| 2:39:50| My apologies if this was stated and I may have missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| So from the point of entry and referral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| what's the timeframe for the assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| for a person to go through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9602)|
| 2:40:04| and be able to be placed in housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9604)|
| 2:40:07| So is this normally take anywhere from an hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| Is it a couple of hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| Is it exactly-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9610)|
| 2:40:11| You're talking about just the intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| You're just talking about the intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9613)|
| 2:40:14| Intake probably takes anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| from a half hour to 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9617)|
| 2:40:21| I thought you were gonna ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9621)|
| 2:40:22| which would have been an interesting answer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| So the intake is about 30, 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| One of the things that we're doing with CHAMP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| and I guess there's another point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9630)|
| 2:40:32| is when did they get to case management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9632)|
| 2:40:35| And that varies widely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| I mean, we've built policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9638)|
| 2:40:42| where outreach workers are being brought in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| to make sure that they're being helped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| to get into case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| But this is something that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| CHAMP is, again, a living, breathing snapshot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| of homelessness in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| So we can kind of monitor our gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9655)|
| 2:40:58| and why are people not getting to case management quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9658)|
| 2:41:01| Or is there a population or is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9661)|
| 2:41:04| So there's a lot of data that we can derive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| from what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9667)|
| 2:41:08| The intake itself, 30, 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| So from intake to referral to housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| what is the whole scope of that timeframe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| Is it within 24 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9679)|
| 2:41:20| So intake to case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| sometimes it's in the same sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| A case management may happen at that same sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| They may go from the intake worker to the case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9687)|
| 2:41:30| Sometimes it takes time to get to the case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| From case management to the referral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| for those separate buckets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| may take time depending on client engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| To get into housing may depend on clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9703)|
| 2:41:48| the housing history, criminal history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| mental health history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| There is most likely an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| There is most likely something that I could provide for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9715)|
| 2:41:58| but it's complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9718)|
| 2:42:00| It's really complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| Okay, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9723)|
| 2:42:03| if you could maybe just send some follow-up data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9723)|
| 2:42:07| that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9727)|
| 2:42:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9728)|
| 2:42:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9729)|
| 2:42:14| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9734)|
| 2:42:19| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9739)|
| 2:42:20| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9742)|
| 2:42:22| Next up, we got Drew Holloway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| He's a housing navigator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| with United Way of Greater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9746)|
| 2:42:28| This is one of the newer programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9748)|
| 2:42:29| that we've been alluding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| Thanks, Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9753)|
| 2:42:34| I appreciate the introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9754)|
| 2:42:36| Thanks everyone for having us all here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| I'm grateful to have the opportunity to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| As Sean said, my name's Drew Holloway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| I'm a housing navigator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9764)|
| 2:42:45| with United Way of Greater Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| It's a part of our House Knox project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9767)|
| 2:42:51| House Knox was launched, a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| It was launched in June of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| We have two housing navigators on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| Our goal is to locate and identify affordable housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| So we are trying to fit into that identification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9782)|
| 2:43:08| Ideally, those units utilizing reduced screening criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9788)|
| 2:43:11| for individuals, families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| that are experiencing instability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| who have barriers to accessing housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| kind of like Chris just detailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| those barriers are not always the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| often quite different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9802)|
| 2:43:25| We are proud to have partnered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9805)|
| 2:43:26| with our coordinated entry system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9806)|
| 2:43:29| which I know we just heard about, CHAMP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9809)|
| 2:43:32| championed by our facilitator, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| and the goal being to identify housing matches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9815)|
| 2:43:40| In our weekly sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| House Knox presents on average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| 10 to 15 affordable housing units that we've identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9823)|
| 2:43:48| Our intent is to quickly identify those that need housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9828)|
| 2:43:51| and would be considered an optimal fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| for private market housing specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| And that is gonna be determined by the intake assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| and the case management recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| whether they fit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9841)|
| 2:44:04| potentially fit in a private market option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9844)|
| 2:44:08| Our efforts are supplemented by a risk mitigation fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| that allows landlords and property managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| to pay for damages or certain financial losses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| that they might incur by leasing to clients we support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9855)|
| 2:44:20| This fund is just one facet of the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| that a client requires to get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9862)|
| 2:44:25| Our process focuses on supplementing the typical deposits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| or rental assistance that would be needed for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| So it's our hope that as we continue to build relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| and curate a more refined process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| for identifying tenant-ready clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9877)|
| 2:44:41| tenant-ready individuals and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| that we'll be able to build a more robust inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| of housing to support those that most need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9885)|
| 2:44:49| and that fit into that rapid rehousing bucket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| that Chris was describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| So that's kind of in its briefest form, House Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9893)|
| 2:44:58| I think it might be more beneficial to open it up to Q&A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| if there are any kind of just general questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9902)|
| 2:45:05| about our work where that's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| Yes, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| Hi, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9912)|
| 2:45:13| You know, I appreciate greatly what y'all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| You've helped a couple of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9915)|
| 2:45:17| that I needed assistance with find housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| and I'm grateful forever because one was a dear friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9920)|
| 2:45:25| But second is, you mentioned the risk mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9925)|
| 2:45:29| fund, how is that funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| where does that funding come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| Is that directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| Yeah, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9933)|
| 2:45:34| So that was a United Way and I'm gonna do a bad job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| but through the RFI process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9937)|
| 2:45:38| those are unrestricted funds raised by the United Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9938)|
| 2:45:44| So it's unrelated to what you would have seen earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9948)|
| 2:45:49| I will say that the risk mitigation fund is beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9949)|
| 2:45:53| but it's not as enticing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9953)|
| 2:45:56| if we don't have really committed plan for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9956)|
| 2:46:03| and this sounds really simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| but a really committed plan for paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9964)|
| 2:46:06| those initial short-term financial needs of a client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| especially if they have no income or very low income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9970)|
| 2:46:15| so specifically deposits and rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| So that mitigation fund, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| is designed to really supplement those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9980)|
| 2:46:24| We don't always have them in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9984)|
| 2:46:27| Which again, that's gonna be what's most enticing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| I think, to any landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9989)|
| 2:46:36| Great, any other questions by council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=9996)|
| 2:46:40| Yes, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10000)|
| 2:46:43| So I just wanted to clarify, Mr. Holloway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10003)|
| 2:46:46| your position is new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| I was just trying to understand how that got added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| and created and what gap it filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10015)|
| 2:47:00| or how it got created, how it got added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| Through quite a bit of research within the United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| and their RFI process, there was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| I think this gets into a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| of the transformational vision of the United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| and trying to modernize some of our processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| and fund a specific issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| rather than just looking at the programs that exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| and funding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| Of course, that's something we're still really committed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10044)|
| 2:47:28| but the issue of housing was coming up constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10048)|
| 2:47:33| in conversations and the need for housing navigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10053)|
| 2:47:36| and someone that would really opine more to landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10056)|
| 2:47:41| and the real estate community and live in that arena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10061)|
| 2:47:44| more than, obviously, we have case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10064)|
| 2:47:47| tied to clients, but trying to support landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| and property management relationship development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| So that was determined to be the issue to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| They wanted to, I guess, United Way decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10077)|
| 2:48:01| that they were going to hire two housing navigators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| I am now one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| And they had, the initial plan was to launch earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10085)|
| 2:48:08| and hire those positions earlier when the pandemic hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| That got delayed a number of months, that whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10091)|
| 2:48:14| So I came on in June and our associate navigator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10094)|
| 2:48:19| came on right around the beginning of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10099)|
| 2:48:25| So we are still finding our footing, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10105)|
| 2:48:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| And Council Member Ryder, I will note housing navigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| is a very, I mean, evidence-based type of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10114)|
| 2:48:40| that COCs employ that has been incredibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| incredibly successful in increasing private market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10123)|
| 2:48:47| housing inventory for rapid rehousing specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| So it was definitely a gap in our COC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| before Drew and his team came along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10135)|
| 2:48:58| So we're very grateful to have him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10138)|
| 2:49:02| and his team doing this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| And it's gonna be, they're gonna be pivotal moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| to help increase how quickly we can get folks into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10146)|
| 2:49:12| So we didn't have anybody else in our general area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| doing this type of work prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| Not directly in the sense the way that Drew is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10159)|
| 2:49:27| I can jump in real quick and just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| that I had actually been talking with a colleague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10169)|
| 2:49:34| and learned about a similar program in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10174)|
| 2:49:40| And then when the United Way was looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10180)|
| 2:49:43| for what to consider for this fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10183)|
| 2:49:47| that Drew was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| I brought it up with them and we had conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| and they liked the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10191)|
| 2:49:53| So we connected them with the folks in San Bernardino| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10193)|
| 2:49:57| that were doing the model out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10197)|
| 2:50:00| Sean has seen it work in other places as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10200)|
| 2:50:04| And so United Way stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10204)|
| 2:50:09| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10209)|
| 2:50:13| Great, any other questions by council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10213)|
| 2:50:19| Awesome, well, thank you, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10219)|
| 2:50:20| I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10220)|
| 2:50:26| Next up, we got Bert Rosen and Danita McCartney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| with the Knoxville Area Rescue Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10230)|
| 2:50:34| Well, good evening, council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| and thank you all for hosting this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| Danita was going to be joining me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| She had another commitment that she had to scoot off to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| and was unable to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10244)|
| 2:50:45| So I'll do my best to navigate through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| Now, what I'd like to do is take a few minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| just kind of walk through CARM, who we are, what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| and then leave time open for any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10254)|
| 2:50:57| that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10257)|
| 2:50:58| And I'll try and move through that as efficiently as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10258)|
| 2:51:01| First, CARM's been in this community since 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10261)|
| 2:51:05| We provide overnight shelter, meals, residential recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10265)|
| 2:51:08| and transitional housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10268)|
| 2:51:10| through the various programs that we offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| We're here 24-7, 365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10272)|
| 2:51:16| We're providing shelter for somewhere between 300 and 400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10276)|
| 2:51:19| men, women, and children each night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| That number vacillates a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| depending on what the weather's doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| and the time of the month, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10285)|
| 2:51:26| when people are receiving their benefit checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10286)|
| 2:51:29| We're also providing somewhere in the ballpark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10289)|
| 2:51:32| of about 750 meals on average per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10292)|
| 2:51:37| Some of the key programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| and so let me just mention this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10299)|
| 2:51:40| Within that group, as we've been talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10300)|
| 2:51:41| about the different homeless populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10301)|
| 2:51:44| that's made up of situational, episodic, and chronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| And as I've listened to conversations about pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| and the need for additional housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| we feel that here because we often find ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10312)|
| 2:51:55| providing services to folks who would qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| for permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| but in the lack of that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| they end up staying here at CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10322)|
| 2:52:03| a lot longer than they need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| and a lot longer than we would like them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| But that's just the reality of what we're contending with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10327)|
| 2:52:11| Just some of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10331)|
| 2:52:13| Our Crossroads Welcome Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10333)|
| 2:52:14| this is the first stop for someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10334)|
| 2:52:16| who's showing up at CARM during daytime hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10336)|
| 2:52:19| If they show up after hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10339)|
| 2:52:20| we'll still take care of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| and then we'll get them over to Crossroads the next morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| And the key services in Crossroads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10345)|
| 2:52:26| are triage, intake, assessment, refer, and monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10346)|
| 2:52:31| The triage is not the medical triage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| but we're trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| what people's most pressing problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| And then once we understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10358)|
| 2:52:39| if it needs immediate attention, then we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10359)|
| 2:52:43| Otherwise, we begin to walk them through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10363)|
| 2:52:46| So the intake is intake into the HMIS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10366)|
| 2:52:49| So everyone who's coming through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10369)|
| 2:52:51| is being processed, if you will, into the HMIS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| They're getting their ID cards here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| Then we're assessing at a deeper level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10377)|
| 2:52:58| what their needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10378)|
| 2:53:00| And then we're referring them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10380)|
| 2:53:01| to the best community option for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| that may or may not be some other program here at CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10384)|
| 2:53:07| It could be somewhere else in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10387)|
| 2:53:09| where that place is best equipped to meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10389)|
| 2:53:12| And then we're monitoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10392)|
| 2:53:13| So if we are referring someone to another agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10393)|
| 2:53:16| we're doing the necessary follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10396)|
| 2:53:17| to make sure that they're getting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10397)|
| 2:53:19| they're getting the help they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10399)|
| 2:53:20| And then we're checking with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10400)|
| 2:53:21| when they end up returning back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| Next stop for someone who would like to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10404)|
| 2:53:27| is our LaunchPoint program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| LaunchPoint is a 30-day co-ed program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10409)|
| 2:53:31| And the easiest way to describe it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| is it helps people get traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| It pays attention to the day-to-day needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| that those who are homeless and on the street have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| whether it's addressing housing issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| legal issues, employment issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10422)|
| 2:53:44| We invite outside content experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| to come and talk on that particular subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10426)|
| 2:53:49| so that each person can begin to form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10429)|
| 2:53:51| their own housing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10431)|
| 2:53:52| a plan for addressing the legal matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| If we've done our job well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| by the end of that 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10438)|
| 2:53:59| a person has a general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| that's their plan for moving forward that's actionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10441)|
| 2:54:05| And we assign a mentor or a coach to walk with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10445)|
| 2:54:08| to help them kind of walk through their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10448)|
| 2:54:10| to make sure that it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| They also have the option then to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10452)|
| 2:54:14| for our Berea program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10454)|
| 2:54:16| Now, our Berea program, pardon me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| it is a co-ed residential program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10458)|
| 2:54:21| It's patterned after the model at Berea College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| And at Berea, their model there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| which they base on learning, labor, and service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10466)|
| 2:54:30| allows a student to pay their tuition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10470)|
| 2:54:33| by purporting those particular functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10473)|
| 2:54:35| that I just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| So we converted the third floor on our property here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| and created a co-ed residential Berea program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10479)|
| 2:54:43| It's not free, but it's also cashless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10483)|
| 2:54:45| So what happens is each person who participates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10485)|
| 2:54:48| in that program is expected to do 200 hours of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10488)|
| 2:54:52| if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10492)|
| 2:54:52| It's really on the job training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10492)|
| 2:54:54| fulfilling necessary functions here inside of CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10494)|
| 2:54:57| But while they're doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10497)|
| 2:54:58| they have a coach who's working with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10498)|
| 2:55:00| paying attention to work habits, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10500)|
| 2:55:03| They're also in the classroom for 200 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10503)|
| 2:55:06| where they're digging deeper into those basic life skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10506)|
| 2:55:09| that they need to lead a productive and meaningful life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| outside in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| And then when they're ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| they're also performing 36 hours of community service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10514)|
| 2:55:18| giving back to the community that has supported them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10518)|
| 2:55:20| up till that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10520)|
| 2:55:23| Once they're done, they're leaving with somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| in the vicinity of about $1,000 in savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10525)|
| 2:55:29| because they're earning while they're in the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10529)|
| 2:55:30| and they're learning real-world money management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| as opposed to just money-managed principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| And so counselors work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| talk them through their buying decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| walking around money that they're gonna need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| to get around the community, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| But they're paying their way through everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10543)|
| 2:55:45| Laundry's not free, meals are not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| So there's a tuition assessed, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| but that's the way they're paying their tuition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| is by doing the same thing students at Berea College do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10552)|
| 2:55:55| Serenity is our long-term residential program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10555)|
| 2:55:58| for a woman who's in crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| whether that's someone who's fleeing a domestic situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10560)|
| 2:56:04| or someone who's had substance abuse challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| They don't have to go through the rest of the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| that we offer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10569)|
| 2:56:10| When someone shows up, if we're detecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| that they are a great candidate to go into Serenity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10573)|
| 2:56:16| they immediately work their way over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| And more often than not, we're full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10578)|
| 2:56:20| but we find a way to put them on a sofa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| or whatever it is we have to do until space opens up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10582)|
| 2:56:26| because we know historically that when a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10586)|
| 2:56:29| who is an addict says, I'm ready for help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| you don't wanna defer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10591)|
| 2:56:33| You wanna get them in and moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10593)|
| 2:56:35| as quickly as you possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10595)|
| 2:56:38| We have a courtyard outside diagonally across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| from the safe space that the city built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10600)|
| 2:56:43| One of the things that we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| a little over two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10605)|
| 2:56:46| but it was curtailed during COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| is something that we call city nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| So the people who stay with us on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10610)|
| 2:56:53| they don't participate in city nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| They're inside sleeping, but this is intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10615)|
| 2:56:58| for the people who are out there on the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| where we can continue to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| and build the relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| If we look at all the research that Dr. Roger Inouye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10624)|
| 2:57:07| has done over the years, he's pointed to three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| One, a decent place to live, the ability to pay for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10630)|
| 2:57:13| and meaningful engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10633)|
| 2:57:14| So city nights is our nighttime outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| that allows people to come onto the courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| It's refreshments, it's just light contact, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10639)|
| 2:57:23| but all intended to learn a person's story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| and figure out how we can best direct them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| to the best resources, again, in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10647)|
| 2:57:31| Two things that connect here are medical respite care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10651)|
| 2:57:35| which is medical transition, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10655)|
| 2:57:36| That's an arrangement that we have with Covenant Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10656)|
| 2:57:39| and I'll come back to that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| And the other thing that we're getting ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10661)|
| 2:57:42| to open up at the end of the month is our care center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10662)|
| 2:57:45| which was actually built out and ready to go last March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| And then when COVID came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10668)|
| 2:57:49| we were talking with the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| about whether or not that space could best be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| to help other challenges that were taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| But with medical respite, if we go back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| and I think it was mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| to the original 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10682)|
| 2:58:05| one of the nine key strategies in all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| was to not discharge people to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10687)|
| 2:58:10| Well, the hospitals have been discharging people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| to the street for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10692)|
| 2:58:14| So the idea here with this is if we could figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10694)|
| 2:58:19| how to have someone medically discharged into CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| then instead of them going back out onto the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10701)|
| 2:58:24| medical professionals would provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| the ongoing necessary respite care, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10706)|
| 2:58:29| Covenant Health is the only hospital that we know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10709)|
| 2:58:32| UT discontinued their home healthcare quite some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10712)|
| 2:58:36| So in this model, we provide the space, the beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10716)|
| 2:58:39| everything that's needed to keep this particular location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10719)|
| 2:58:42| up and running, neat and clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10722)|
| 2:58:44| and the home healthcare division of Covenant Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10724)|
| 2:58:46| comes in and provides the medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10726)|
| 2:58:49| It's only eight beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10729)|
| 2:58:50| It was intended to be larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10730)|
| 2:58:51| but that was all we could get started with with Covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| And what we have found is a substantial reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| in the number of 911 calls and the 911 transports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10736)|
| 2:59:00| So we've seen that reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10740)|
| 2:59:02| On a typical day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10742)|
| 2:59:04| CARM averages five and a half 911 calls per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10744)|
| 2:59:08| It's a dual responder system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10748)|
| 2:59:09| The research has shown us that a small percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| of those are actually life-threatening emergencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| but we're not medical providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10756)|
| 2:59:17| And so if someone says, I need you to call 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10757)|
| 2:59:20| we go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10760)|
| 2:59:22| Well, if someone ends up at a Covenant hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10762)|
| 2:59:25| they're then discharged back into that respite unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| that I just described to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10768)|
| 2:59:30| The piece that we're getting ready to open up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| at the end of this month is on the front end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10772)|
| 2:59:35| So that if someone approaches someone on our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| thinking they need medical attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10778)|
| 2:59:40| we will be able to direct them over to this care center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10780)|
| 2:59:43| which again, we will be operating the space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10783)|
| 2:59:46| but we have lined up social work interns, medical interns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10786)|
| 2:59:49| Tennessee Wesleyan's gonna be coming in on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| so that we will both do education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| as well as immediate treatment of people's needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| limiting the 911 calls only to those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| who really need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| Now, we won't make that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| but the idea is if we have to talk someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| who's going through a mental health crisis off the ledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| so to speak, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10808)|
| 3:00:10| If someone is a diabetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10810)|
| 3:00:11| whose blood sugar is a little out of kilter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| we'll be able to treat those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| but not responding to any of life-threatening stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10815)|
| 3:00:18| And what we're finding here is that by doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10818)|
| 3:00:22| we're substantially reducing the number of 911 calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10822)|
| 3:00:25| which then has a benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10825)|
| 3:00:26| given we're a dual responder system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10826)|
| 3:00:28| Cuts down on the cost of those 911 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10828)|
| 3:00:32| And when we can get people help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10832)|
| 3:00:34| it helps the medical community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10834)|
| 3:00:35| and it just helps us as taxpayers all the way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10835)|
| 3:00:38| So we're just trying to provide a comprehensive response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10838)|
| 3:00:41| for people who are coming in on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| so that we can then get them pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10844)|
| 3:00:45| in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| And let me just pause there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10847)|
| 3:00:48| That was a quick flyover in the interest of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10848)|
| 3:00:51| but if you've got questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| I'll be delighted to do my best to try and respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10853)|
| 3:01:04| Any questions for Mr. Rosen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10864)|
| 3:01:09| Yes, Councilman Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10869)|
| 3:01:11| I guess if no one has any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| I'll just jump in really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10873)|
| 3:01:17| So, Mr. Rosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10877)|
| 3:01:20| There's something, Councilwoman Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| There's something happening with your sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| that I can't make out what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| Can you not hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10887)|
| 3:01:28| Cause I don't know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10888)|
| 3:01:29| I can hear you, but it was garbled before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| Now I hear you crystal clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| I don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10893)|
| 3:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10894)|
| 3:01:36| For the folks that use your shelter each night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10896)|
| 3:01:39| what time do they have to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| There aren't day shelter options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10904)|
| 3:01:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10906)|
| 3:01:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10908)|
| 3:01:49| For the general emergency shelter beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10909)|
| 3:01:53| I'm sorry, say again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10913)|
| 3:01:56| So say what you said again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10916)|
| 3:01:57| You said they don't have to leave your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10917)|
| 3:02:00| No one has to leave our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10920)|
| 3:02:01| So we have the courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10921)|
| 3:02:04| So for those people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10924)|
| 3:02:06| we have to clean the dorms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10926)|
| 3:02:07| and we've got to clean the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10927)|
| 3:02:08| but while we're cleaning the dorms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| people are welcome to go sit outside in our outdoor shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| And when the weather is inclement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10935)|
| 3:02:16| we have indoor space for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10936)|
| 3:02:18| but no one is told you have to leave the car on property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| and then you can't return until the evening hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10941)|
| 3:02:24| It was like that years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10944)|
| 3:02:25| but it hasn't been like that for years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10945)|
| 3:02:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10949)|
| 3:02:30| So what time does cleaning of the dorm start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10950)|
| 3:02:33| Like what is the timeframe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10953)|
| 3:02:36| Yeah, everybody is up by 6 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| breakfast is served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10958)|
| 3:02:39| and 11 a.m. is our bullseye target time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| to have the entire building spick and span| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10962)|
| 3:02:44| and ready for the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10964)|
| 3:02:45| that'll be coming in in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10965)|
| 3:02:48| So if someone's to stay there all day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10968)|
| 3:02:51| and they stay in the courtyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| what hours would they be out in the courtyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| Well, they'd be out in the courtyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10976)|
| 3:02:58| The courtyard opens at 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10978)|
| 3:02:59| because we're also storing bags out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| There's also public restrooms out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10982)|
| 3:03:04| So they would leave our building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10984)|
| 3:03:06| go out to the courtyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10986)|
| 3:03:07| and they can be on the courtyard all day long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10987)|
| 3:03:09| until we close that at 4.30 in the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10989)|
| 3:03:13| when people start coming back in the building for dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10993)|
| 3:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10997)|
| 3:03:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10998)|
| 3:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=10999)|
| 3:03:25| Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11005)|
| 3:03:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11007)|
| 3:03:28| Mr. Rosen, what has your capacity been like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11008)|
| 3:03:30| for the past year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11010)|
| 3:03:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11013)|
| 3:03:34| So we had to remove a small percentage of beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11014)|
| 3:03:38| and a small number of tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11018)|
| 3:03:40| in order to accommodate the social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11020)|
| 3:03:44| But just for comparative purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| from March of 2019 to March of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11026)|
| 3:03:51| we were averaging 300 overnight guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11031)|
| 3:03:55| During the year of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11035)|
| 3:03:56| that dropped to 257 or it was a 14% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11036)|
| 3:04:01| We saw a 23% reduction in the number of meals served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11041)|
| 3:04:04| I'm sorry, a 23% reduction in the number of unique guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11044)|
| 3:04:09| And Councilman Smith, just for definition purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| a unique guest is one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| It's not a person who comes back multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| So in the year prior to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| we had 4,277 unique individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11061)|
| 3:04:24| that came to us for at least one night of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11064)|
| 3:04:27| That was down 23% during the year of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11067)|
| 3:04:31| And the number of meals that we served dropped by 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11071)|
| 3:04:36| And what type of reconfiguration did you have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11076)|
| 3:04:40| during COVID or in response to COVID, I should say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11080)|
| 3:04:44| Yeah, so it was a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11084)|
| 3:04:47| One is we had to put our guest reception area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11087)|
| 3:04:51| where we do the intake, the HMIS issue IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11091)|
| 3:04:55| that was typically happening inside the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11095)|
| 3:04:58| We had to rent sort of a makeshift office, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11098)|
| 3:05:02| that we put outside so that we could begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| doing temperature checks and everything else outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11105)|
| 3:05:08| The second thing was a lot of the programs we offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| like LaunchPoint and some of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| those are small group settings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| where people are around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11115)|
| 3:05:16| So we suspended any program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| that involved that kind of interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11119)|
| 3:05:20| until we could get up and begin sort of offering it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11120)|
| 3:05:23| like we're doing now via Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11123)|
| 3:05:26| And then with the beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11126)|
| 3:05:28| we had to take out about 10% of the beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| so that we could create greater distance between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11131)|
| 3:05:34| And then we changed the sleeping configurations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| sort of staggering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11136)|
| 3:05:37| So you didn't have heads all sleeping next to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11137)|
| 3:05:40| You had a head sort of against feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11140)|
| 3:05:42| on the opposite sides of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11142)|
| 3:05:44| And then in the dining room when we did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11144)|
| 3:05:47| because we typically have like a four top where people sit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| we took tables out and then moved tables apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| to create that distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| That was really the only significant change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| we had to make programmatically or to accommodate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11156)|
| 3:05:59| but we also had to change the way we were doing officing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| So we basically treated the property here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11162)|
| 3:06:06| as if it was two separate locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| So nobody who works upstairs was going downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11168)|
| 3:06:12| Nobody who works downstairs was coming upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| And then we discontinued our volunteer program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11175)|
| 3:06:18| so that we weren't bringing anybody else in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11178)|
| 3:06:19| so that we could keep those that were staying with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11179)|
| 3:06:22| as safe as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11182)|
| 3:06:23| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11183)|
| 3:06:25| I believe you're the largest facility we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11185)|
| 3:06:29| for those experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11189)|
| 3:06:31| Is that correct in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11191)|
| 3:06:33| I believe that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| And so I know safety is a comment I hear a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11195)|
| 3:06:40| and that's challenging in a number of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11200)|
| 3:06:43| but given you're the largest facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11203)|
| 3:06:44| can you talk about safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11204)|
| 3:06:48| important safety criteria or protocol that you all use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11208)|
| 3:06:53| to make sure that you keep that many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11213)|
| 3:06:56| as safe as possible together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| So from a COVID standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| every person who comes through the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| is having their temperature checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| Put that aside for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| We've got 24-hour uniform security here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11228)|
| 3:07:12| and they are at the doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| and they're out in the parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| They don't have any authority to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11236)|
| 3:07:17| on the cities or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| Inside the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11239)|
| 3:07:20| every person goes through a metal detector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11240)|
| 3:07:23| And so if they're bringing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| that shouldn't be coming in in the way of weapons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11245)|
| 3:07:28| then those are confiscated from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| And since they're not illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| they're returned to them when they go back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11252)|
| 3:07:37| It's very, very rare that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11257)|
| 3:07:40| any kind of violence in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| We have had it happen on occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11263)|
| 3:07:44| when there's folks who need to be maintained on medication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| who have gone off their medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| And then we find we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11269)|
| 3:07:51| a little calming in all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11271)|
| 3:07:54| And in the 18 years that I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11274)|
| 3:07:56| we've only had one person stabbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11276)|
| 3:07:58| and that was with a plastic knife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| that was taken out of the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11280)|
| 3:08:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11286)|
| 3:08:07| Thanks for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11287)|
| 3:08:08| Any other questions for Mr. Rosen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11288)|
| 3:08:15| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11295)|

| 3:08:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11299)|
| 3:08:20| And let me apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11300)|
| 3:08:22| This has run longer than I anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| so I'll be able to hang for a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| but I'll have to cut out in just a little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| and just wanted you to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11310)|
| 3:08:31| Thank you, Bert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11311)|
| 3:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11312)|
| 3:08:33| Next we have Chris Martin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11313)|
| 3:08:34| with the Knoxville Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11314)|
| 3:08:42| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11322)|
| 3:08:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11323)|
| 3:08:44| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11324)|
| 3:08:45| I wasn't gonna say good afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11325)|
| 3:08:46| but that's long been gone now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11326)|
| 3:08:49| So, wow, what an evening we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11329)|
| 3:08:54| Thank you for letting me be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11334)|
| 3:08:57| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11337)|
| 3:08:58| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11339)|
| 3:08:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11339)|
| 3:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11340)|
| 3:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11341)|
| 3:09:02| Thank you for letting me be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| I'll just take a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11345)|
| 3:09:06| and talk a little bit about Flinagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| Flinagan Landing was a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11349)|
| 3:09:10| of the 10-Year Planned In Chronic Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11350)|
| 3:09:15| Southeastern Housing Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11355)|
| 3:09:16| which is a program of KLF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11356)|
| 3:09:18| Knoxville Leadership Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11358)|
| 3:09:19| was selected by Mayor Haslam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11359)|
| 3:09:23| back at the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11363)|
| 3:09:24| of the 10-Year Planned In Chronic Homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11364)|
| 3:09:26| to be the property manager and developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11366)|
| 3:09:30| for the Permanent Supportive Housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11370)|
| 3:09:32| the Housing First piece of the 10-Year Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11372)|
| 3:09:36| We did, Southeastern did, has done two projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| We did a fee development project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11379)|
| 3:09:40| with four volunteer ministry center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11380)|
| 3:09:44| on the Menville Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| Did all of the financial packaging for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11386)|
| 3:09:50| and then the rehab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11390)|
| 3:09:51| and managed a lot of the construction on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11391)|
| 3:09:53| And we also have done Flinagan Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11393)|
| 3:09:57| which we've actually maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11397)|
| 3:09:59| and operating on ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11399)|
| 3:10:01| So Flinagan has been open now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11401)|
| 3:10:05| for about 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| We've learned a lot over that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| We stood in front of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11409)|
| 3:10:14| back in about 10 or 12 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11414)|
| 3:10:17| and made some promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11417)|
| 3:10:18| that Flinagan would be a good place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11418)|
| 3:10:20| for the community in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11420)|
| 3:10:22| which it's turned out to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11422)|
| 3:10:25| There were a lot of naysayers back in those days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11425)|
| 3:10:28| about what this was gonna look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11428)|
| 3:10:30| And it was actually quite painful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11430)|
| 3:10:32| to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11432)|
| 3:10:33| just for the public was not very excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11433)|
| 3:10:38| about us being in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11438)|
| 3:10:40| But as time has gone on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11440)|
| 3:10:42| Flinagan has been an absolute asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| to South Knoxville and to the community out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| We've maintained the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11449)|
| 3:10:50| as we said we were going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11450)|
| 3:10:51| is a very attractive apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11451)|
| 3:10:54| And so we've got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| We learned a lot about trying to get people into Flinagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11457)|
| 3:11:02| what it was involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11462)|
| 3:11:04| We worked hard and I spent quite a bit of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11464)|
| 3:11:07| fighting for permanent project-based vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11467)|
| 3:11:12| for Flinagan and Menvilla and Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11472)|
| 3:11:16| That was a real issue back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11476)|
| 3:11:18| We couldn't get people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11478)|
| 3:11:19| cause we couldn't get them vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11479)|
| 3:11:20| And so we've won that battle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11480)|
| 3:11:23| and got some project-based vouchers for the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11483)|
| 3:11:28| But since that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11488)|
| 3:11:29| we've learned a lot about just building community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11489)|
| 3:11:32| and what really takes to see people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11492)|
| 3:11:34| have a healthy place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11494)|
| 3:11:36| And so we couldn't do what we do without our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11496)|
| 3:11:40| We do, we work really closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11500)|
| 3:11:41| with Volunteer Ministry Center and Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11501)|
| 3:11:45| and also with CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11505)|
| 3:11:48| We are not a homeless shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11508)|
| 3:11:51| We promised the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11511)|
| 3:11:52| that we would not be a homeless shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11512)|
| 3:11:54| We're not gonna scoop people up off the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11514)|
| 3:11:56| and take them right out to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11516)|
| 3:11:58| That's not what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11518)|
| 3:11:59| Flinagan is a great place for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| who are ready to begin to put their life back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11521)|
| 3:12:05| It's not a great place for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| who are not interested in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11527)|
| 3:12:08| And so we work with the Volunteer Ministry Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11528)|
| 3:12:13| and also CARM to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11533)|
| 3:12:15| as we begin to move people into Flinagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11535)|
| 3:12:17| we have a plan and they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11537)|
| 3:12:22| so we've got a very good success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11542)|
| 3:12:24| of how long people are staying in our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11544)|
| 3:12:27| It's a permanent place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11547)|
| 3:12:28| and it's supported by case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| So people can live there for the rest of their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11550)|
| 3:12:34| It is, they sign leases with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11554)|
| 3:12:37| just like any other apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11557)|
| 3:12:40| There are rules in that lease that they have to abide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11560)|
| 3:12:45| And we work with a property management company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11565)|
| 3:12:49| that helps us manage the asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| And then we backfill that with case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| and 24 hour a day and seven day a week staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11573)|
| 3:12:58| So it's much more expensive to manage a property like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11578)|
| 3:13:01| than it is a normal affordable housing apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11581)|
| 3:13:05| But we've really had a pretty good run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11585)|
| 3:13:09| with Flinagan in the last number of years here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11589)|
| 3:13:11| in the last four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11591)|
| 3:13:12| after we kind of worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11592)|
| 3:13:14| trying to figure out what we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11594)|
| 3:13:15| I told council and a number of people back 10, 12 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| that the hard part of getting Flinagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11599)|
| 3:13:23| or Menvilla built and finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11603)|
| 3:13:26| as hard as that was for us back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11606)|
| 3:13:28| the hard work really was beginning to operate the facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11608)|
| 3:13:31| and learning how to do that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| We've learned together as a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| of volunteer ministry center staff and our staff and CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11615)|
| 3:13:39| we've all kind of worked together to learn how to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11619)|
| 3:13:42| And it's been quite exciting to see, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11622)|
| 3:13:47| what we've seen happen out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11627)|
| 3:13:48| We've had quite a bit of success in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11628)|
| 3:13:51| For us, it's just incredibly rewarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11631)|
| 3:13:54| to see people putting their lives back together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11634)|
| 3:13:56| beginning to see somebody who has been on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11636)|
| 3:13:59| for 10 or 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11639)|
| 3:14:00| beginning to reconnect with their family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11640)|
| 3:14:02| now that they're healthy and beginning to stabilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11642)|
| 3:14:05| and get back and begin to be a contributing member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11645)|
| 3:14:09| of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11649)|
| 3:14:10| So I'm not gonna get down on the weeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| on all the operations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11653)|
| 3:14:15| If you're interested in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11655)|
| 3:14:16| I'd be glad to, I'd love to show you around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11656)|
| 3:14:18| It's better to come see it and I'll take you on a tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11658)|
| 3:14:20| I'll even pay for the gas of the van to get you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11660)|
| 3:14:23| But one of the things I would like to mention in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11663)|
| 3:14:28| is that, so I had an opportunity four or five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11668)|
| 3:14:33| we'd work with a lot of school social work interns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11673)|
| 3:14:36| We have a ton of young people work for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11676)|
| 3:14:38| with UT's College of Social Work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11678)|
| 3:14:42| And so the one day we had a group of these students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11682)|
| 3:14:47| that had to do an assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11687)|
| 3:14:48| And so they had to go out and actually sit with somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11688)|
| 3:14:51| and understand their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| And so we sent them out to Flinagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| and they sat and interviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11695)|
| 3:14:57| and met with some of the residents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| And as we were learning about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| they've learned about their past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11701)|
| 3:15:03| and what they've been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11703)|
| 3:15:05| And so they wrote all that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11705)|
| 3:15:06| and then they had to make a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11706)|
| 3:15:08| to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11708)|
| 3:15:09| So I pulled a few of our staff together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11709)|
| 3:15:12| And about before the presentation time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11712)|
| 3:15:14| I had spent the morning over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11714)|
| 3:15:16| at our Knox Works Workforce Development Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11716)|
| 3:15:19| where we work with young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11719)|
| 3:15:21| who are coming out of or court involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11721)|
| 3:15:23| they've had a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11723)|
| 3:15:26| There are 5,000 young people who are not in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11726)|
| 3:15:29| and are not working on any given day in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11729)|
| 3:15:33| These kids are the kids that are killing each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| Honestly, that's what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| These kids are the kids that are struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11737)|
| 3:15:40| and having a hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11740)|
| 3:15:42| And I listened to these kids' story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11742)|
| 3:15:44| these young people, they're 18 to 20 year olds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11744)|
| 3:15:47| a lot of them, and listening to their backstory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11747)|
| 3:15:50| what they've come from, this extreme trauma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11750)|
| 3:15:53| the difficulties in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| the family situations they've come out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| what they've been exposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11758)|
| 3:16:00| And it's just awful, some of the stories there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11760)|
| 3:16:02| So I walked into this group with these interns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| and listened to them talk about the stories at Flinagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11765)|
| 3:16:10| And there was a light bulb that came on for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11770)|
| 3:16:12| because they were the same story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11772)|
| 3:16:14| The people at Flinagan were just 10 or 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11774)|
| 3:16:17| down the road from where the kids were at Knox Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11777)|
| 3:16:20| So if we're not doing something with young people now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11780)|
| 3:16:23| and addressing these folks where they are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11783)|
| 3:16:26| we're gonna continue to have this door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11786)|
| 3:16:29| of chronically homeless people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11789)|
| 3:16:30| that are showing up on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| These kids to make choices, once they get out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11793)|
| 3:16:36| drugs and everything is ravishing our world in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11796)|
| 3:16:42| But I just wanna make a plea for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11802)|
| 3:16:46| we've gotta look at chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| and homelessness is, you can't look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11808)|
| 3:16:52| if all we're doing is putting Band-Aids on problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| if all we're doing is dealing with homeless right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| if we don't back up and begin to look at families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| and children and youth and teenagers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11819)|
| 3:17:02| if all we're doing is creating a pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11822)|
| 3:17:04| because these kids are disconnected out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11824)|
| 3:17:06| and they're not doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11826)|
| 3:17:08| So we've had another piece of that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11828)|
| 3:17:12| that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11832)|
| 3:17:13| We've just gotten a pilot program started with the THDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11833)|
| 3:17:17| that we're gonna be working with kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11837)|
| 3:17:19| that are aging out of foster care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11839)|
| 3:17:21| because a lot of those kids are winding up on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| and don't have a place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11843)|
| 3:17:24| So we've got a voucher program that we've been awarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11844)|
| 3:17:27| that we're gonna have a list of vouchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11847)|
| 3:17:30| have a number of vouchers that we can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| and we're working with DCS before kids are aging out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11852)|
| 3:17:36| case manage those into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11856)|
| 3:17:37| and we'll manage that voucher program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11857)|
| 3:17:39| So we're hoping to prevent homelessness in these ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11859)|
| 3:17:44| and working with young people on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11864)|
| 3:17:46| And I think that's a big piece of this equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| I know that's not necessarily the topic of the night tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11868)|
| 3:17:51| but it's something that we've gotta focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11871)|
| 3:17:54| because we can continue to do what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11874)|
| 3:17:56| and still struggle in the organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11876)|
| 3:17:59| that do homeless care every day are doing miraculous work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11879)|
| 3:18:05| But at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11885)|
| 3:18:06| we've gotta get out in front of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11886)|
| 3:18:09| And I think we can prevent a lot of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| if we will really put the resources and time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11891)|
| 3:18:14| into prevention rather than continuing to scoop people up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11894)|
| 3:18:18| and try to repair their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11898)|
| 3:18:21| But Flintington is a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11901)|
| 3:18:22| It's been a great model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| It's just like Menville, the same exact programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11904)|
| 3:18:28| And we learn together and work together on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| and part of the CHAMP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11911)|
| 3:18:34| And so anyway, I'll leave it at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11914)|
| 3:18:39| and take any questions that you might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| about what we do out at Flintington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| Many of you have been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11923)|
| 3:18:44| and already been around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11924)|
| 3:18:45| so you probably would know it pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11925)|
| 3:18:47| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11927)|
| 3:18:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11929)|
| 3:18:53| Great, any questions for Chris Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11933)|
| 3:18:57| Yes, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11937)|
| 3:18:58| I just have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11938)|
| 3:18:59| Mr. Martin, you'll be pleased to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| that there's two or three folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| who were really against Flintington Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11944)|
| 3:19:08| being built in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11948)|
| 3:19:09| who have independently come up to me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11949)|
| 3:19:12| if you ever need anybody to vouch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| for a similar model elsewhere in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11954)|
| 3:19:18| they'd be first at the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11958)|
| 3:19:19| So you've made believers out of previously naysayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11959)|
| 3:19:25| The proof's in the pudding, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11965)|
| 3:19:28| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11968)|
| 3:19:31| It was a painful, very, very painful season of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11971)|
| 3:19:34| And I know it was for Bill Haslam and a number of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11974)|
| 3:19:38| and Mike Dunthorne was a part of that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| and it was a difficult, difficult time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| but we proved the fact that it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| And I think that we've got something now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11986)|
| 3:19:50| to show people what we're doing and how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11990)|
| 3:19:53| And we've learned a lot that we need to build off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11993)|
| 3:19:56| And so I'm a big fan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11996)|
| 3:19:57| I know we're really looking to and interested in doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=11997)|
| 3:20:00| I'd love to do a couple of more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12000)|
| 3:20:02| of Flintington Landings type projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12002)|
| 3:20:06| where our board has actually talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12006)|
| 3:20:08| getting pretty aggressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12008)|
| 3:20:09| and trying to tee a couple of projects up like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12009)|
| 3:20:11| So hopefully we're gonna be able to do some more here soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12011)|
| 3:20:15| Funding's gonna be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12015)|
| 3:20:17| So I would really challenge you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12017)|
| 3:20:19| Flintington has no debt on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12019)|
| 3:20:20| We raised all of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12020)|
| 3:20:21| Manbilla doesn't have debt on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| And the only way you can do a facility like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12023)|
| 3:20:26| is really to have it debt-free when you go into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12026)|
| 3:20:29| because they just can't afford to carry the debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12029)|
| 3:20:32| like a normal affordable housing project could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12032)|
| 3:20:35| You've gotta have, we spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12035)|
| 3:20:37| we're raising about another $160,000 a year over and above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12037)|
| 3:20:41| what the vouchers pay for the operations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12041)|
| 3:20:44| And so when you're having to raise that kind of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| just to keep the supportive services going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12047)|
| 3:20:49| in the 24-hour-a-day services happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12049)|
| 3:20:53| you can't afford to have debt on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12053)|
| 3:20:54| So we've gotta have a way that we can figure out a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12054)|
| 3:20:57| to fund these projects at the get-go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12057)|
| 3:21:00| from all the way, get them open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12060)|
| 3:21:03| without any kind of debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12063)|
| 3:21:05| that we have in the fund on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12065)|
| 3:21:08| So anyway, but yeah, we're ready to do some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12068)|
| 3:21:10| and would love to get your friends out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12070)|
| 3:21:13| to vouch for us when we start doing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12075)|
| 3:21:20| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12080)|
| 3:21:22| So Mr. Martin, you touched on a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12082)|
| 3:21:25| Number one, you started answering a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12085)|
| 3:21:28| I was gonna ask, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12088)|
| 3:21:29| are you looking to do more units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12089)|
| 3:21:30| So you said you guys are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12090)|
| 3:21:34| and funding, of course, is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12094)|
| 3:21:36| Do you have properties in mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12096)|
| 3:21:39| Like what's your timeframe for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12099)|
| 3:21:43| We'll have them open tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12103)|
| 3:21:45| How about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12105)|
| 3:21:45| Will that work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| Well, that answers the need that we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| the workshop with at four o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| Thanks for solving the problem in three and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| I had plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| Are you talking two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12116)|
| 3:21:59| Are you talking five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12119)|
| 3:22:00| Because that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12120)|
| 3:22:01| We're perpetually behind the eight ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12121)|
| 3:22:03| So I was just trying to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12123)|
| 3:22:05| Well, I'll say, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12125)|
| 3:22:06| Flanagan and Menville, both of those projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| when we were doing them, developing on those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| it took the better part of two years to get them developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12130)|
| 3:22:14| Land acquisition and where to place them is a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12134)|
| 3:22:18| And I'm sure Bruce and Gabe can tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| talked about that, what they ran into just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12141)|
| 3:22:25| Communities love the idea about what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12145)|
| 3:22:28| but they just, it's the NIMBY thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12148)|
| 3:22:30| Nobody wants it near them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12150)|
| 3:22:32| And so we do not have property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| We do not have a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12154)|
| 3:22:37| that we've just started to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12157)|
| 3:22:40| And, but property is going to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12160)|
| 3:22:42| Building costs are going to be issue right now too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12162)|
| 3:22:45| Construction costs, on all of our other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| we do a lot of single family housing construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12167)|
| 3:22:49| and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12169)|
| 3:22:50| KLF does a lot of things across town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12170)|
| 3:22:52| but the cost of construction right now is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12172)|
| 3:22:56| Everything real estate is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12176)|
| 3:22:58| And so it's going to be difficult to try to pull that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12178)|
| 3:23:01| But I think, you know, with the right funding sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12181)|
| 3:23:06| and the right commitment from the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12186)|
| 3:23:09| and from others in the city, I think we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| It's just going to take some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12192)|
| 3:23:14| to find the right location and pull it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12194)|
| 3:23:16| I mean, it's just not, it's not as simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12196)|
| 3:23:19| And you're right, it's going to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12199)|
| 3:23:20| if we pull the trigger right now to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12200)|
| 3:23:24| and you said, we've got a check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12204)|
| 3:23:26| we can give you to fund this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| It would probably be at least two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12208)|
| 3:23:30| before we can get something open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12210)|
| 3:23:32| Okay, but that's helpful information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12212)|
| 3:23:34| like two years, not five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12214)|
| 3:23:35| I was trying to get a gauge on what the timeframe is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12215)|
| 3:23:39| for something additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| That would be considering that there was no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12222)|
| 3:23:47| I mean, we went through at least seven different properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12227)|
| 3:23:50| back in the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12230)|
| 3:23:52| that got killed in community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12232)|
| 3:23:57| We went one after another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12237)|
| 3:23:59| from different locations around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| And the idea was to create smaller apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12241)|
| 3:24:07| of somewhere in the 40 to 55 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12247)|
| 3:24:11| And I think that's probably for a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| like Menville or Flanagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12255)|
| 3:24:19| 60 is probably as much as you would want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12259)|
| 3:24:23| It just gets a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12263)|
| 3:24:24| and that's probably on the high end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| But somewhere around 50 is probably the right number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| So that means you got smaller apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12269)|
| 3:24:32| that you're gonna put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12272)|
| 3:24:33| And what we thought that they would be better suited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12273)|
| 3:24:36| to go in communities like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12276)|
| 3:24:37| And I'll let Gabe and VMC speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12277)|
| 3:24:41| but Flanagan feels different than Menville does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| because of the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12284)|
| 3:24:47| You go to Flanagan and it's quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12287)|
| 3:24:49| It's a peaceful part of the community out there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12289)|
| 3:24:51| And Menville is right downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12291)|
| 3:24:54| and it's got its sets of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12294)|
| 3:24:57| because of where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12297)|
| 3:25:00| And so my advice would be to try to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12300)|
| 3:25:02| more neighborhood-based places to put these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12302)|
| 3:25:04| because our residents are not problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| once they get stabilized in our facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12307)|
| 3:25:10| and we begin to do case management with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12310)|
| 3:25:13| They don't, we hardly ever have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12313)|
| 3:25:14| any kind of real problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12314)|
| 3:25:16| So it's, I would, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12316)|
| 3:25:20| but it's gonna take some time to find the right location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12320)|
| 3:25:23| If two years would be if there was no pushback and no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12323)|
| 3:25:27| you know, you go through a project, find a location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12327)|
| 3:25:30| it takes you three months to find out the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12330)|
| 3:25:31| gonna shoot you at the stake by trying to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12331)|
| 3:25:37| But it, and then you gotta start over again, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12337)|
| 3:25:40| So it's, if there's no opposition to the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12340)|
| 3:25:44| and the funding was there, it would be a two-year deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12344)|
| 3:25:47| Okay, and then the one other comment on what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12347)|
| 3:25:50| you talked about dealing with the root cause of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12350)|
| 3:25:53| and the drug addictions and kind of avoiding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12353)|
| 3:25:58| kind of pipeline feeding people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12358)|
| 3:26:00| You have suggestions on how to tackle that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12360)|
| 3:26:03| And is that within the purview of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12363)|
| 3:26:06| or are we talking about other entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12366)|
| 3:26:09| and other government bodies beyond council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12369)|
| 3:26:14| Yeah, I mean, I'm old enough now to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12374)|
| 3:26:17| unfortunately for me, my knees hurt and everything hurts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12377)|
| 3:26:20| but I remember the day when Lakeshore closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12380)|
| 3:26:26| and when Lakeshore closed, there were a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12386)|
| 3:26:29| that got stuck out on the street, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12389)|
| 3:26:32| And we're dealing with that same issue now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12392)|
| 3:26:35| There's just not enough beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12395)|
| 3:26:36| A lot of the folks that we deal with have mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12396)|
| 3:26:38| and things like that, that they really need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12398)|
| 3:26:40| the supportive services that we gotta have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12400)|
| 3:26:42| There are no beds for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12402)|
| 3:26:43| We got between the two or three groups that are doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12403)|
| 3:26:46| we got maybe 150 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12406)|
| 3:26:50| That's stretching it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12410)|
| 3:26:51| So we need drug and alcohol treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12411)|
| 3:26:56| There's not enough beds for, I mean, there's just nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12416)|
| 3:26:59| If we have somebody that's at Flinigan that relapses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| and has a problem, which that happens quite often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| trying to find some place for them to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12423)|
| 3:27:05| into a resident program is almost impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12425)|
| 3:27:09| And so we don't have options for drug and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12429)|
| 3:27:13| Our office is in the Regas building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| and I sit there right across the street from Burt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| and watch on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| I mean, there are literally folks sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12439)|
| 3:27:20| down on the sidewalk shooting heroin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12440)|
| 3:27:22| in their arm every day, all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12442)|
| 3:27:25| And as much as you wanna try to put them in CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12445)|
| 3:27:30| or someplace or in Flinigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12450)|
| 3:27:32| those people are not ready for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12452)|
| 3:27:35| When you're on drugs and the stuff that does these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12455)|
| 3:27:37| it's just, they're not gonna go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12457)|
| 3:27:39| they're not gonna wind up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12459)|
| 3:27:40| They can't be in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12460)|
| 3:27:41| They can't come to anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| They're just not going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12463)|
| 3:27:43| So they're gonna go camp somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| And so you can talk about, you don't like camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12465)|
| 3:27:48| or all that kind of stuff all day long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12468)|
| 3:27:49| but until you deal with drugs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12469)|
| 3:27:51| and some of those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12471)|
| 3:27:54| we're not gonna get after dealing with the camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12474)|
| 3:27:58| And so the solutions there, it's gotta be a crisis mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12478)|
| 3:28:02| There's gotta be a place for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12482)|
| 3:28:03| for drug and alcohol treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12483)|
| 3:28:05| There's gotta be options for Burt and for BMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12485)|
| 3:28:08| and Gabe for them to be able to send people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| to that's gonna get them real help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12490)|
| 3:28:12| in a long-term treatment programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12492)|
| 3:28:16| We need beds for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12496)|
| 3:28:17| And I think that's the crisis piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| And then we need permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12499)|
| 3:28:21| once they're ready and clean and ready to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12501)|
| 3:28:23| and make a go at their life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| we can move them into those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12505)|
| 3:28:28| Housing First is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12508)|
| 3:28:29| There was an article in HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| there was a big article that was published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12511)|
| 3:28:32| not too long ago that Ignace there on Housing First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12512)|
| 3:28:36| And there was a whole thing about that that I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12516)|
| 3:28:40| I still think that I believe in Housing First model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12520)|
| 3:28:43| I think we've gotta get, but the Housing First model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| for somebody sitting under the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| over on corner of Magnolia and Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12527)|
| 3:28:51| it's not to come to Flinnigan or Menville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| it's gotta be in a treatment center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12533)|
| 3:28:57| We're just not, we were not designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12537)|
| 3:28:58| we were never designed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12538)|
| 3:29:02| And so alcohol and drugs are a big issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12542)|
| 3:29:05| in this particular part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12545)|
| 3:29:08| And in East Tennessee, opioid got us all started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12548)|
| 3:29:12| I mean, we've got, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12552)|
| 3:29:14| y'all know about all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12554)|
| 3:29:16| But I don't have a lot of great answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12556)|
| 3:29:18| but I think that is the, you've got an emergency issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12558)|
| 3:29:22| you gotta deal with and a crisis going on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12562)|
| 3:29:25| But the long-term solution is we've gotta be investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12565)|
| 3:29:28| at the same time in younger folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12568)|
| 3:29:30| before they get to this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12570)|
| 3:29:32| I think you gotta do both and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12572)|
| 3:29:37| Thank you for all of your insight on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12577)|
| 3:29:42| Any other questions for Mr. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12582)|

| 3:29:58| Next we have Matt Tillery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12598)|
| 3:30:00| He's with Knoxville Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12600)|
| 3:30:04| While simultaneously, he is the president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12604)|
| 3:30:07| of the Knoxville-Knox County Homeless Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12607)|
| 3:30:11| Hey, thank you, Sean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12611)|
| 3:30:13| Vice President of Rental Assistance for Section 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12613)|
| 3:30:16| was formerly Housing Operations Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12616)|
| 3:30:18| So I get the best of both worlds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| of all the different types of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12620)|
| 3:30:21| that KCDC owns, operates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12621)|
| 3:30:24| and then has out for rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12624)|
| 3:30:29| So I'm gonna do my best tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12629)|
| 3:30:31| to be brief but impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12631)|
| 3:30:35| I promise I'll try to do my best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12635)|
| 3:30:37| but these are two things that I really, really care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| So here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12639)|
| 3:30:42| Starting out with the mission of KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12642)|
| 3:30:45| has really three basic tenets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12645)|
| 3:30:48| Looking at providing quality, affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12648)|
| 3:30:51| advancing the development incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12651)|
| 3:30:53| which you all are quite intimately knowledgeable about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12653)|
| 3:30:57| as we come to you all quite often there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12657)|
| 3:30:59| But it's really that third tenet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12659)|
| 3:31:01| that I really wanna talk about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12661)|
| 3:31:02| That's fostering self-sufficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12662)|
| 3:31:05| We have a lot of different programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12665)|
| 3:31:06| a lot of different partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12666)|
| 3:31:07| that really focus in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12667)|
| 3:31:10| And I think that really goes in total agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12670)|
| 3:31:13| with some of Chris Martin's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12673)|
| 3:31:17| that that's where we build somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12677)|
| 3:31:20| to be able to sustain themselves away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12680)|
| 3:31:23| or within something else that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12683)|
| 3:31:27| to improve their life and improve their route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12687)|
| 3:31:30| and their trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12690)|
| 3:31:33| Is that really that self-sufficiency piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| that touches the heart of everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12695)|
| 3:31:38| And so we have and are exploring more and more options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| to find housing that hits all those other options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12701)|
| 3:31:45| but really looking at what's best and appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12705)|
| 3:31:48| for the individual or the family that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| So right now, currently we're exploring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12712)|
| 3:31:53| some social support services within our own walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12713)|
| 3:31:58| especially looking at some of the high-rises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12718)|
| 3:32:00| that are dedicated to our elderly and disabled residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12720)|
| 3:32:06| and even some of our family style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12726)|
| 3:32:09| locations that work within those same tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12729)|
| 3:32:16| We also do a ton of partnering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12736)|
| 3:32:18| with a lot of the organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12738)|
| 3:32:20| that you've already heard about and will hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12740)|
| 3:32:25| A lot of these are the panelists that we're talking to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12745)|
| 3:32:29| but really what we know that we're able to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12749)|
| 3:32:32| is that level of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12752)|
| 3:32:34| which allows for flexibility for our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12754)|
| 3:32:39| to excel in the areas that we see them as the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12759)|
| 3:32:43| So we can provide the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12763)|
| 3:32:45| and the other agencies that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12765)|
| 3:32:49| We have CAC inside of our buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12769)|
| 3:32:51| We have with multitude of programs within CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12771)|
| 3:32:55| We have UT nursing within our walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12775)|
| 3:33:00| We have a lot of different programs that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12780)|
| 3:33:02| and that we achieve through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12782)|
| 3:33:05| But really probably one of the most notable that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12785)|
| 3:33:07| is on that section eight side, that project-based voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12787)|
| 3:33:12| I wanna kind of go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12792)|
| 3:33:12| I mentioned earlier, and I wanna go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12792)|
| 3:33:16| We have, currently we have 351 project-based vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12796)|
| 3:33:20| or project-based units out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12800)|
| 3:33:24| One of the things that we are looking at with there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12804)|
| 3:33:27| we're looking at Menvilla, Flemington Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12807)|
| 3:33:31| McNabs, Cox and Baker sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12811)|
| 3:33:34| Meadowbrook, Restoration House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12814)|
| 3:33:36| the cottages at Clifton, Southside Flats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12816)|
| 3:33:38| and then HomeSource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12818)|
| 3:33:40| Each of those represent all 351 project-based units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12820)|
| 3:33:43| that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12823)|
| 3:33:45| The ones that are really exciting about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12825)|
| 3:33:47| but as Chris and I'm sure Gabe will talk about here too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12827)|
| 3:33:52| is this is a very long haul or long slog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12832)|
| 3:33:55| to get up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12835)|
| 3:33:57| And so it's really wonderful that we have 212 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12837)|
| 3:34:02| that have already gone into their effective AHAP date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12842)|
| 3:34:05| that will be able to come on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12845)|
| 3:34:08| once they're able to be built and moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12848)|
| 3:34:12| Those, I just wanna talk just briefly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12852)|
| 3:34:14| and talk about that flexibility that our sites offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12854)|
| 3:34:21| So with Pond Gap, we've got 59 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12861)|
| 3:34:23| that are two and three bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12863)|
| 3:34:25| Young High Pike has nine three bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12865)|
| 3:34:30| At Moss Grove, we have 46 one, two, and three bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12870)|
| 3:34:34| And then we have 51 bedrooms at Mineral Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12874)|
| 3:34:36| and 48 one bedrooms at Caswell Manor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12876)|
| 3:34:41| going to be coming on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12881)|
| 3:34:44| What that means is that that's 212 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12884)|
| 3:34:46| that will be able to find units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12886)|
| 3:34:48| or 212 households, rather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12888)|
| 3:34:50| that will be able to find units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12890)|
| 3:34:52| that is in an evidence-based practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12892)|
| 3:34:56| that we know works in our own backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12896)|
| 3:34:59| going to all the ones that we have already discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12899)|
| 3:35:02| and will discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12902)|
| 3:35:03| This is a program that works and we know that it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12903)|
| 3:35:07| And so I think what we wanna be proponents for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12907)|
| 3:35:12| is being able to push that through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12912)|
| 3:35:15| having the boldness to be able to push those through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12915)|
| 3:35:18| within the project-based system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12918)|
| 3:35:22| One of the other things that I wanna talk on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12922)|
| 3:35:24| and is really about the Homeless Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12924)|
| 3:35:30| the mission there has some flowery language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12930)|
| 3:35:34| that's been there since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12934)|
| 3:35:37| And it's really excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12937)|
| 3:35:40| One of the things that it really discusses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12940)|
| 3:35:42| is seeking permanent housing solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12942)|
| 3:35:46| and homelessness prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12946)|
| 3:35:47| So those two tenants that are really the bread and butter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12947)|
| 3:35:50| of what the Homeless Coalition does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12950)|
| 3:35:54| Of course, that work is done primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12954)|
| 3:35:56| within those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12956)|
| 3:35:57| Those committees represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12957)|
| 3:35:58| the Advocacy and Development Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12958)|
| 3:36:00| Education and Training, which provides training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12960)|
| 3:36:03| and education to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12963)|
| 3:36:06| whether that be landlords, looking at landlord summits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12966)|
| 3:36:10| really looking at recruitment of landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12970)|
| 3:36:12| to be able to come on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12972)|
| 3:36:14| and case managers and all service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12974)|
| 3:36:18| at multiple levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12978)|
| 3:36:19| We have the Homeless Youth Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12979)|
| 3:36:21| And from that, CAC is able to utilize their position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12981)|
| 3:36:28| and open up a youth advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12988)|
| 3:36:30| which is absolutely fantastic for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12990)|
| 3:36:32| to be able to build a trajectory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12992)|
| 3:36:36| that we may or may not work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=12996)|
| 3:36:40| but hearing from them and what would work for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13000)|
| 3:36:43| for their housing solutions before we build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13003)|
| 3:36:46| and before we implement programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13006)|
| 3:36:48| And then the Outreach and Engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13008)|
| 3:36:51| The reason I mentioned these committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13011)|
| 3:36:56| we're about to be visited by our friends in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13016)|
| 3:36:59| for our next meeting coming up next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13019)|
| 3:37:02| for the MDHA, our COC that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13022)|
| 3:37:04| They contacted Mike and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| hey, really what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13026)|
| 3:37:09| I've got a quote is that several of the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13029)|
| 3:37:15| that the homeless coalition seems to be the most productive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13035)|
| 3:37:18| and most aligned to community action and engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13038)|
| 3:37:22| with focus on particular agency and new services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13042)|
| 3:37:27| the committee updates and strong connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13049)|
| 3:37:30| Each of those things matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13050)|
| 3:37:32| because what they're seeing us do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13052)|
| 3:37:34| is that we aren't siloed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13054)|
| 3:37:36| And I wish I could take even a microscopic piece of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13056)|
| 3:37:42| but I'm just the schmuck that gets to brag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13062)|
| 3:37:46| on the coalition every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13066)|
| 3:37:48| It really is all the work that's being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13068)|
| 3:37:50| in the meantime between the meetings that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13070)|
| 3:37:56| One of rag on, this was also seen back last August in 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13076)|
| 3:38:02| where the governor's office faith-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13082)|
| 3:38:05| and community initiative came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13085)|
| 3:38:07| and they basically said the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13087)|
| 3:38:08| They were really interested in how we were able to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13088)|
| 3:38:14| in high-level discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13094)|
| 3:38:16| and not even necessarily agree with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13096)|
| 3:38:18| but come out of that room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13098)|
| 3:38:20| and come out of all of our discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13100)|
| 3:38:23| with that single track, that solution focused mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13103)|
| 3:38:28| to eliminating homelessness as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13108)|
| 3:38:31| as much as we absolutely can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13111)|
| 3:38:34| To Mike's point, we really are changing our rhetoric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13114)|
| 3:38:39| and our lexicon to say that we will end homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13119)|
| 3:38:43| That's a wonderful goal to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| Is it realistic and does it help us in strategic planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13125)|
| 3:38:48| I question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13128)|
| 3:38:49| It's really challenging that thought there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13129)|
| 3:38:53| So to wrap up really what I want us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13133)|
| 3:38:56| if you have anything to take home as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13136)|
| 3:38:59| solutions are really found in the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13139)|
| 3:39:02| that bolster the support for services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13142)|
| 3:39:05| which keep people housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13145)|
| 3:39:06| And then the funding for new housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13146)|
| 3:39:09| which can remain affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13149)|
| 3:39:11| So with that, I'll open up to questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13151)|
| 3:39:13| and thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13153)|
| 3:39:19| Great, any questions for Matt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13159)|
| 3:39:29| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13169)|
| 3:39:29| Well, thank you, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13169)|
| 3:39:30| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13170)|
| 3:39:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13172)|
| 3:39:35| Next we have Lynn Human Hilliard with the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13175)|
| 3:39:44| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13184)|
| 3:39:47| Good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13187)|
| 3:39:48| It's good to see everyone, especially the fellow providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13188)|
| 3:39:52| It's nice to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13192)|
| 3:39:54| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13194)|
| 3:39:58| I would, I'm gonna try to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13198)|
| 3:40:01| more of an overall picture of the services that we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13201)|
| 3:40:05| and maybe take just a minute to tell you a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13205)|
| 3:40:07| about who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13207)|
| 3:40:10| The Helen Ross McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13210)|
| 3:40:11| which we are now known as the McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13211)|
| 3:40:14| has been a behavioral health center since 1948.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13214)|
| 3:40:18| And I know that when I came to work here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13218)|
| 3:40:20| we had already had homeless programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13220)|
| 3:40:22| So it was in the 80s, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13222)|
| 3:40:24| when we first started serving individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13224)|
| 3:40:26| who were experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13226)|
| 3:40:29| It is something near and dear to our leadership's heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13229)|
| 3:40:31| and we believe it is fully in our mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13231)|
| 3:40:34| to address this need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13234)|
| 3:40:38| We provide mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13238)|
| 3:40:40| We provide substance use disorder treatment services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13240)|
| 3:40:44| We provide victim and crisis services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13244)|
| 3:40:47| Our victim services are around domestic violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| and sexual assault, and then social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13249)|
| 3:40:53| We provide services for children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13253)|
| 3:40:56| families, and individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13256)|
| 3:40:59| And I think it's also important to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13259)|
| 3:41:03| that a lot of our services that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13263)|
| 3:41:05| are services for individuals who are uninsured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13265)|
| 3:41:08| who have chin care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13268)|
| 3:41:10| who may have commercial insurance, private pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13270)|
| 3:41:13| and then of course we get several local, state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13273)|
| 3:41:17| and federal and private funding as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13277)|
| 3:41:19| So we put all that together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13279)|
| 3:41:21| to hopefully build a continuum of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13281)|
| 3:41:24| that meets a lot of gaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| I think, in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13286)|
| 3:41:27| And I think it's important to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13287)|
| 3:41:29| everything that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13289)|
| 3:41:30| because throughout our entire continuum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13290)|
| 3:41:33| we serve individuals who present to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13293)|
| 3:41:35| experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13295)|
| 3:41:38| So we also have a unique division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13298)|
| 3:41:41| that has unique programming designed for this population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13301)|
| 3:41:47| And so what I'll do is give you a little highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13307)|
| 3:41:50| about what those are and kind of in an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13310)|
| 3:41:56| I'll start a little bit with our youth program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13316)|
| 3:41:58| We have, of course, many of you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| the Project Safe Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| where we have temporary shelters through host homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13323)|
| 3:42:06| We have transitional living for youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13326)|
| 3:42:10| as well as several programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13330)|
| 3:42:13| to work with youth and family through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13333)|
| 3:42:16| I think outreach and case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13336)|
| 3:42:17| is the best way to describe it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13337)|
| 3:42:19| with really the goal of engaging them in services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13339)|
| 3:42:23| I looked at the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13343)|
| 3:42:25| we served approximately 400 children and youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13345)|
| 3:42:30| in the past year in those services alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13350)|
| 3:42:33| When you look at our adult services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13353)|
| 3:42:35| for specifically for in this division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13355)|
| 3:42:38| for specific unique populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13358)|
| 3:42:40| we have most commonly what you hear about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13360)|
| 3:42:43| is our PATH program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| And that is where we serve the street outreach component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13365)|
| 3:42:49| as well as a case management component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13369)|
| 3:42:53| Again, with the goal of identifying individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13373)|
| 3:42:56| with mental health and substance use disorders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13376)|
| 3:42:58| that we can engage in treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13378)|
| 3:42:59| get into housing, get hopefully a continued income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13379)|
| 3:43:04| Those are the goals of those programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13384)|
| 3:43:06| but they're getting into other traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13386)|
| 3:43:08| outpatient mental health services in addition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13388)|
| 3:43:12| Last year, we served again about 400 adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13392)|
| 3:43:16| through these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13396)|
| 3:43:18| We also have programming that provides assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13398)|
| 3:43:21| So financial assistance, as well as helping people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13401)|
| 3:43:25| perhaps uninsured individuals who may need help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13405)|
| 3:43:28| with teen care applications to get their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13408)|
| 3:43:30| So we do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13410)|
| 3:43:33| And then most of the funding of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13413)|
| 3:43:35| is to either try to help people prevent homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13415)|
| 3:43:38| by providing utility payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13418)|
| 3:43:41| or maybe someone who's discharging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13421)|
| 3:43:44| from an inpatient hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13424)|
| 3:43:45| who might need housing temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13425)|
| 3:43:47| We have a little bit of funds to bridge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13427)|
| 3:43:50| So that's part of what we do on our homeless programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13430)|
| 3:43:56| I also wanna talk a little bit about other programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13436)|
| 3:43:59| that we have at the center that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13439)|
| 3:44:02| serve a higher percentage of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13442)|
| 3:44:05| who are experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13445)|
| 3:44:07| We have the safety net program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13447)|
| 3:44:10| excuse me, funded through the Department of Mental Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13450)|
| 3:44:13| and Substance Abuse Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13453)|
| 3:44:15| There's an established behavioral health safety net.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| So if an individual's in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13457)|
| 3:44:19| who is uninsured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13459)|
| 3:44:21| but is in need of mental health services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13461)|
| 3:44:23| they are eligible of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13463)|
| 3:44:25| to receive funding through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13465)|
| 3:44:26| It's almost like a pot of money that can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13466)|
| 3:44:29| almost like insurance funding for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13469)|
| 3:44:31| to get additional outpatient services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13471)|
| 3:44:35| So that's been going well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13475)|
| 3:44:37| And that continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13477)|
| 3:44:38| I think the Department of Mental Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13478)|
| 3:44:39| has tried to expand that to children this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13479)|
| 3:44:42| So we're very fortunate in our community to get those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13482)|
| 3:44:47| I also think that our services for our crisis services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13487)|
| 3:44:51| really work with individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13491)|
| 3:44:52| who are experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13492)|
| 3:44:54| That includes our crisis stabilization unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13494)|
| 3:44:57| the three-day stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13497)|
| 3:44:58| Individuals can come there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13498)|
| 3:44:59| regardless of their ability to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13499)|
| 3:45:02| It is a step down from inpatient hospitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13502)|
| 3:45:06| Most important thing we wanna do there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13506)|
| 3:45:08| is stabilization of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13508)|
| 3:45:10| and then transition them to an outpatient provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13510)|
| 3:45:14| to get them engaged with somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13514)|
| 3:45:17| instead of going to the emergency departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13517)|
| 3:45:19| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13519)|
| 3:45:20| And hopefully it's a step down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13520)|
| 3:45:23| from having to go to a hospitalization stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13523)|
| 3:45:28| The other thing that we have that is supported by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13528)|
| 3:45:31| is our behavioral health urgent care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13531)|
| 3:45:34| We provide for individuals who come present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13534)|
| 3:45:38| to law enforcement with one of those few misdemeanor charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13538)|
| 3:45:42| but really need more service intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13542)|
| 3:45:45| They can come to our behavioral health urgent care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13545)|
| 3:45:48| And we have, I keep consistently checking that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13548)|
| 3:45:51| we have about 50% of individuals that we serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13551)|
| 3:45:54| who are reporting homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13554)|
| 3:45:56| Now that's a broad definition of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13556)|
| 3:45:58| but that's a significant amount of individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13558)|
| 3:46:00| I think, that are falling between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13560)|
| 3:46:02| falling through the gaps of their places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13562)|
| 3:46:04| and then they're identified through law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13564)|
| 3:46:08| and brought to us for care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13568)|
| 3:46:10| And so we're real proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13570)|
| 3:46:12| And that is of course, like I said, supported by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13572)|
| 3:46:15| We also have the co-response program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13575)|
| 3:46:18| that Sergeant Clinton mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13578)|
| 3:46:21| where we have a behavioral health person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| going along with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13583)|
| 3:46:24| to help individuals in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13584)|
| 3:46:26| that might be experiencing a mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13586)|
| 3:46:28| or substance use disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13588)|
| 3:46:30| So that's going, that's in the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13590)|
| 3:46:32| So we're still collecting data on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13592)|
| 3:46:35| but so far it's looking very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13595)|
| 3:46:38| And then we have our substance use disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13598)|
| 3:46:41| treatment continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13601)|
| 3:46:42| So we provide the full array of outpatient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13602)|
| 3:46:46| intensive outpatient, residential rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13606)|
| 3:46:49| and detoxification for individuals who are uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13609)|
| 3:46:54| We have the contract with the Department of Mental Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13614)|
| 3:46:56| for that, for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13616)|
| 3:46:57| So if anybody is uninsured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13617)|
| 3:47:00| they would be referred to us for that level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13620)|
| 3:47:04| And Chris is right, waiting lists are long for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13624)|
| 3:47:07| who need residential care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13627)|
| 3:47:11| And our typical length of stay for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13631)|
| 3:47:13| is about 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13633)|
| 3:47:15| And the waiting list can be several weeks to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13635)|
| 3:47:18| And so, when someone is needing care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13638)|
| 3:47:22| waiting is really not the most optional thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13642)|
| 3:47:25| So we know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13645)|
| 3:47:26| I think there's a lot of challenges around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13646)|
| 3:47:28| We're looking to expand those beds next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13648)|
| 3:47:30| So that's something we're excited to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13650)|
| 3:47:33| And I just wanna end, I'm trying to go pretty fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13653)|
| 3:47:37| I would just say on the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13657)|
| 3:47:38| one of the most important things that we think that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13658)|
| 3:47:41| to address this issue is housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13661)|
| 3:47:44| We are in agreement that permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13664)|
| 3:47:47| is the solution to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13667)|
| 3:47:50| We provide 93 units of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13670)|
| 3:47:54| within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13674)|
| 3:47:56| Our model is that they're scattered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13676)|
| 3:47:58| We have one site that has 24 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13678)|
| 3:48:00| but most of our sites have about 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13680)|
| 3:48:03| and we have some that are eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13683)|
| 3:48:05| So that's our kind of our model that's worked well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13685)|
| 3:48:09| Most recently, those have been for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13689)|
| 3:48:13| who are veterans who are experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13693)|
| 3:48:15| And we have set aside about 33 units for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13695)|
| 3:48:19| also supported by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13699)|
| 3:48:22| I wanna add that we operate the domestic violence shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13702)|
| 3:48:27| So that's women and children fleeing from domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13707)|
| 3:48:31| We operate the shelter for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| And we have seven transitional living units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13713)|
| 3:48:36| for individuals in that situation that we can place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13716)|
| 3:48:40| And then this fall, hopefully we'll be able to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13720)|
| 3:48:44| the 50 units of additional housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| at our Mineral Springs location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13727)|
| 3:48:49| which is supported by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13729)|
| 3:48:50| So, we can't say enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13730)|
| 3:48:53| If you ask the staff here in any of the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13733)|
| 3:48:56| that we serve, what is the one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13736)|
| 3:48:59| that would make a difference in so many of our clients lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13739)|
| 3:49:03| and they would all say that housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13743)|
| 3:49:06| housing is the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13746)|
| 3:49:07| We can get individual care and service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13747)|
| 3:49:10| but there's so many barriers that exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13750)|
| 3:49:12| for someone to get into care if they don't have housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13752)|
| 3:49:15| And so we're supportive in that mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13755)|
| 3:49:20| as any way that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13760)|
| 3:49:22| So I'll stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13762)|
| 3:49:23| I feel like I'm rambling and just answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13763)|
| 3:49:25| anybody may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13765)|
| 3:49:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13767)|
| 3:49:30| Thank you, Leigh Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13770)|
| 3:49:31| Any questions for Leigh Ann and the MNAB Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13771)|
| 3:49:39| Yes, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13779)|
| 3:49:40| I'm gonna ask a quick question and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13780)|
| 3:49:42| We've been at this for four hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13782)|
| 3:49:44| and I wanna say to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13784)|
| 3:49:46| I appreciate everyone being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13786)|
| 3:49:47| So I want you all to feel like it's worth your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13787)|
| 3:49:50| because I asked multiple times for this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13790)|
| 3:49:53| So maybe one of the ways since it's gone so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13793)|
| 3:49:57| is to maybe set up some individual appointments with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13797)|
| 3:49:59| Leigh Ann, I'll just limit my question to you right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13799)|
| 3:50:03| to how has the BHUC gone and how have operations been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13803)|
| 3:50:08| and capacity in the last year during COVID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13808)|
| 3:50:13| So thank you for the question, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13813)|
| 3:50:16| I'm really proud of our staff and all of our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13816)|
| 3:50:18| We've continued to keep our doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13818)|
| 3:50:21| As far as the Urgent Care Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13821)|
| 3:50:23| we've been able to continue to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13823)|
| 3:50:27| with the same number of beds in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13827)|
| 3:50:30| We've, of course, established protocols early in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13830)|
| 3:50:34| to make sure that temperatures are checked, PPE is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13834)|
| 3:50:39| It was difficult early on like it was for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13839)|
| 3:50:42| but that became much easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13842)|
| 3:50:45| And then, of course, we have also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13845)|
| 3:50:48| the community-based portion of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13848)|
| 3:50:51| So we have staff who are going out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13851)|
| 3:50:54| and we were very concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13854)|
| 3:50:55| at any given time, we have about 60 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13855)|
| 3:50:57| on that caseload and we were very concerned about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13857)|
| 3:51:02| So our staff continue to do home visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13862)|
| 3:51:04| and go out and provide services in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13864)|
| 3:51:10| I'm not sure if that answered your question, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13870)|
| 3:51:12| It did, so you guys didn't have to cut back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13872)|
| 3:51:15| And then, so the other part of that question is how many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13875)|
| 3:51:19| like what's the occupancy rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13879)|
| 3:51:21| Like, do you have empty beds at the BEOC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13881)|
| 3:51:24| We have four to six beds, but usually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13884)|
| 3:51:28| they're about four in the observation unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13888)|
| 3:51:30| And our average daily census usually runs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13890)|
| 3:51:33| if you spread out the average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13893)|
| 3:51:34| it's about two, maybe three a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13894)|
| 3:51:36| I'd have to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13896)|
| 3:51:37| We're on target to serve about 500 in the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13897)|
| 3:51:41| but when you look at it, there's peaks of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13901)|
| 3:51:45| So at any given time, you'll have four to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13905)|
| 3:51:48| six people in the unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13908)|
| 3:51:49| And then other times, it'll be much less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13909)|
| 3:51:52| So there is some sporadic in when those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13912)|
| 3:51:55| are presented to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13915)|
| 3:51:58| Okay, I'll stop with my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13918)|
| 3:52:04| So I know one of the issues with the BEOC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13924)|
| 3:52:06| is how long people stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13926)|
| 3:52:10| And the max would probably be the 72 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13930)|
| 3:52:13| because of the pending, it was less time, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13933)|
| 3:52:16| Well, actually, the CSU is 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13936)|
| 3:52:19| The Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13939)|
| 3:52:21| is less than 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13941)|
| 3:52:23| And then they're stepped down into the community-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13943)|
| 3:52:26| if they choose to take that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13946)|
| 3:52:27| they're stepped down into the community-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13947)|
| 3:52:29| service delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13949)|
| 3:52:31| We found early on, I mean, early on when we had it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13951)|
| 3:52:33| we had the three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13953)|
| 3:52:35| and that's when we didn't have the community-based portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13955)|
| 3:52:39| And we just noticed that the census didn't support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13959)|
| 3:52:42| that length of stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13962)|
| 3:52:43| So we reduced the length of stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13963)|
| 3:52:44| to add the community-based portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13964)|
| 3:52:48| Okay, I guess I didn't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13968)|
| 3:52:49| that there was a community-based side of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13969)|
| 3:52:52| as an option to continue care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13972)|
| 3:52:54| because no one's cured in 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13974)|
| 3:52:57| Absolutely, we got some feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13977)|
| 3:53:01| from the city and county, I think at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13981)|
| 3:53:04| that that was something that we felt early on was a gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13984)|
| 3:53:08| that people were getting the observation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13988)|
| 3:53:11| and then they were left to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13991)|
| 3:53:13| especially with the number of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13993)|
| 3:53:15| who are uninsured and homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13995)|
| 3:53:18| then there wasn't a lot of community-based services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=13998)|
| 3:53:20| to transition them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14000)|
| 3:53:25| So we switched that a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14005)|
| 3:53:27| shortened the stay at the observation unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14007)|
| 3:53:30| lengthened this and created the community-based portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14010)|
| 3:53:34| And so, like I said, about 60 at any given time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14014)|
| 3:53:37| are in that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| I think the average, I'd have to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14019)|
| 3:53:40| the average length of stay in that is three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14020)|
| 3:53:44| It's very intensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| but you could stay longer or shorter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14026)|
| 3:53:49| depending on the unique need of the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14029)|
| 3:53:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14032)|
| 3:53:53| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14033)|
| 3:53:56| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14036)|
| 3:53:58| Thank you, Leigh Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14038)|
| 3:54:02| We got two speakers left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14042)|
| 3:54:04| and then we'll move on to the priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14044)|
| 3:54:07| Next is Gabe Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14047)|
| 3:54:09| And if everyone is in agreement with Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14049)|
| 3:54:12| we can submit questions via email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14052)|
| 3:54:17| to speed things up to these individual providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14057)|
| 3:54:20| if that is fruitful to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14060)|
| 3:54:24| Please take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14064)|
| 3:54:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14067)|
| 3:54:28| Hi, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14068)|
| 3:54:28| Thank you for hanging in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14068)|
| 3:54:30| Thank you for your interest in homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14070)|
| 3:54:33| I'm Gabe Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14073)|
| 3:54:34| I'm the Chief Clinical Services Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14074)|
| 3:54:36| at Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14076)|
| 3:54:38| And I'm just gonna go through the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14078)|
| 3:54:41| I'm gonna try to answer some of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14081)|
| 3:54:44| that I think have come up as we've been doing the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14084)|
| 3:54:49| So I hope to remember the questions that arose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14089)|
| 3:54:58| So I'm going to go through our services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14098)|
| 3:55:04| in some ways the way a neighbor would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14104)|
| 3:55:06| So as we mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14106)|
| 3:55:09| VMC is the designated access point for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14109)|
| 3:55:13| for the CHAMP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14113)|
| 3:55:16| And I think one of the things that CHAMP does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14116)|
| 3:55:19| is it really helps us trace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14119)|
| 3:55:24| how somebody flows through the service system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14124)|
| 3:55:27| with services for those who are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14127)|
| 3:55:32| And it really has helped identify some gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14132)|
| 3:55:34| So what we have noticed at VMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14134)|
| 3:55:39| is that we are doing that initial intake assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14139)|
| 3:55:44| for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14144)|
| 3:55:46| And we don't always have an adequate number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14146)|
| 3:55:51| of housing case management places to refer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14151)|
| 3:55:54| So we are certainly referring to VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14154)|
| 3:55:58| We are also referring to Cherokee or to Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14158)|
| 3:56:02| or to various other providers in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14162)|
| 3:56:07| And there does seem to be a gap there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14167)|
| 3:56:10| Part of the reason that there is a gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14170)|
| 3:56:12| is the theme that's been kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14172)|
| 3:56:15| I don't wanna beat the dead horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14175)|
| 3:56:17| but the theme of our system is getting clogged up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14177)|
| 3:56:23| So people come in, they are working with case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14183)|
| 3:56:27| And if we could move them more quickly into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14187)|
| 3:56:30| that would open up the case management spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14190)|
| 3:56:32| to people through the system into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14192)|
| 3:56:37| where we all know we're trying to get people eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14197)|
| 3:56:42| So we serve as the designated access point for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14202)|
| 3:56:49| We do referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14209)|
| 3:56:54| We also have street outreach that's been mentioned tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14214)|
| 3:56:58| We started with our original two street outreach members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14218)|
| 3:57:02| in August of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14222)|
| 3:57:04| In January of this year, we added four more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14224)|
| 3:57:07| That has been tremendously helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14227)|
| 3:57:10| We focus mainly on the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14230)|
| 3:57:13| but having the expanded teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14233)|
| 3:57:15| has allowed us to go out a little bit farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14235)|
| 3:57:19| And we are doing CHAMP assessments in the field now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14239)|
| 3:57:22| because we've got more staff to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14242)|
| 3:57:29| But we also are really trying to get people connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14249)|
| 3:57:31| So one of the things we say over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14251)|
| 3:57:34| is that folks who are experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14254)|
| 3:57:39| on the streets and not engaged with shelter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14259)|
| 3:57:42| is because things are so chaotic for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14262)|
| 3:57:49| they lose track of appointments and they lose contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14269)|
| 3:57:52| if they do have a mental health case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14272)|
| 3:57:54| And so one of the things that our street outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14274)|
| 3:57:56| has been able to do is to try to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14276)|
| 3:58:00| that folks can stay connected with those service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14280)|
| 3:58:07| And that's in addition to really encouraging people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14287)|
| 3:58:10| to pursue housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14290)|
| 3:58:15| Let's see, we have the FOIA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14295)|
| 3:58:17| which is also a relatively new program for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14297)|
| 3:58:19| That is our housing focused low barrier shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14299)|
| 3:58:24| We opened that in December of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14304)|
| 3:58:27| So right before the pandemic really hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14307)|
| 3:58:30| We started out with 40 beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14310)|
| 3:58:32| and then due to COVID moved down to 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14312)|
| 3:58:39| Let me talk just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14319)|
| 3:58:40| about what a low barrier housing focused shelter means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14320)|
| 3:58:43| The low barrier piece is that we do not require people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14323)|
| 3:58:51| to be sober.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14331)|
| 3:58:53| We don't require them to be med compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14333)|
| 3:58:58| We do, a low barrier does not mean no rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14338)|
| 3:59:02| and it doesn't mean no expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14342)|
| 3:59:05| We do require that people's behavior be safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14345)|
| 3:59:12| and be not so disturbing on your day to night sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14352)|
| 3:59:17| So obviously no illegal behavior in the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14357)|
| 3:59:27| no substance use in the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14367)|
| 3:59:28| no alcohol use in the shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14368)|
| 3:59:32| But we also recognize that when folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14372)|
| 3:59:37| the FOIA is designed for people who have been camping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14377)|
| 3:59:40| And so as we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14380)|
| 3:59:41| that's a population that they've got a lot of barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14381)|
| 3:59:48| to accessing services and to accessing treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14388)|
| 3:59:57| So we really just want to try to get them inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14397)|
| 4:00:00| to a safe place where it is a housing focused shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14400)|
| 4:00:04| So we do want people to be working towards housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14404)|
| 4:00:10| in the best way that they can and as quickly as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14410)|
| 4:00:18| The Resource Center is our largest VMC program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14418)|
| 4:00:21| That's our housing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14421)|
| 4:00:23| So people who are experiencing rural homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14423)|
| 4:00:28| will come to the Resource Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14428)|
| 4:00:30| to get housing case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14430)|
| 4:00:32| We're open Monday through Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14432)|
| 4:00:35| and we have case management first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14435)|
| 4:00:39| but we also offer meals, showers, laundry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14439)|
| 4:00:43| and a place where people can be inside during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14443)|
| 4:00:48| and remain safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14448)|
| 4:00:51| What I will say about housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14451)|
| 4:00:54| is that what we discover in the Resource Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14454)|
| 4:00:58| because we have been following through the CHAMP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14458)|
| 4:01:05| really targeting the more vulnerable people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14465)|
| 4:01:08| most of the folks that are accessing the Resource Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14468)|
| 4:01:12| do need permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14472)|
| 4:01:15| I do want to speak to the fact that in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14475)|
| 4:01:21| permanent supportive housing really is geared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14481)|
| 4:01:23| towards people who need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14483)|
| 4:01:31| The chronically homeless that have disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14491)|
| 4:01:34| who have case management for a long-term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14494)|
| 4:01:38| sometimes I'll think about it as case management for life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14498)|
| 4:01:40| that that's somebody who really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14500)|
| 4:01:44| needs that long-term case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14504)|
| 4:01:47| We haven't talked as much tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14507)|
| 4:01:49| about people who are homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14509)|
| 4:01:52| and they need case management to find housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14512)|
| 4:01:55| but they don't necessarily need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14515)|
| 4:01:56| ongoing case management forever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14516)|
| 4:01:59| And I think we also need to develop housing for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14519)|
| 4:02:05| because there is a lack there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14525)|
| 4:02:09| So we've talked a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14529)|
| 4:02:10| about permanent supportive housing tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14530)|
| 4:02:13| and definitely don't wanna take away from the need for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14533)|
| 4:02:20| But I also don't want to forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14540)|
| 4:02:21| that we need additional housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14541)|
| 4:02:27| such as what Drew is trying to develop for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14547)|
| 4:02:33| in developing relationships with just landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14553)|
| 4:02:38| in the private market who might be willing to take vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14558)|
| 4:02:41| and looking at just more affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14561)|
| 4:02:45| that is not necessarily specifically designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14565)|
| 4:02:50| for homeless folks, but that would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14570)|
| 4:02:53| and work with providers who are providing case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14573)|
| 4:02:56| and would accept somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14576)|
| 4:02:57| who is coming from a homeless situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14577)|
| 4:03:01| So we are looking to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14581)|
| 4:03:04| and expand our rapid rehousing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14584)|
| 4:03:07| And that's what we're looking to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14587)|
| 4:03:08| is for people who have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14588)|
| 4:03:13| obviously everybody who is experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14593)|
| 4:03:18| is in crisis, but there are people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14598)|
| 4:03:24| with multiple, multiple barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14604)|
| 4:03:27| And then there are people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14607)|
| 4:03:31| with some less intensive case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14611)|
| 4:03:36| some help getting ID and birth certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14616)|
| 4:03:39| and some help just navigating the housing system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14619)|
| 4:03:42| because particularly affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14622)|
| 4:03:44| and subsidized housing, it's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14624)|
| 4:03:47| It is not straightforward at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14627)|
| 4:03:54| And folks need some case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14634)|
| 4:03:56| just to help navigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14636)|
| 4:03:57| So one of the things that VMC is looking to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14637)|
| 4:04:01| is really increase our ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14641)|
| 4:04:04| to provide rapid rehousing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14644)|
| 4:04:07| and doing that by partnering with House Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14647)|
| 4:04:11| by partnering with the Section 8 voucher program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14651)|
| 4:04:15| And so for our VMC rapid rehousing program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14655)|
| 4:04:20| to provide some bridge and funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14660)|
| 4:04:21| to get people into housing, get into that apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14661)|
| 4:04:25| and provide case management to get them a voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14665)|
| 4:04:30| so that housing becomes more sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14670)|
| 4:04:33| And then with the goal of eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14673)|
| 4:04:37| that case management no longer being needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14677)|
| 4:04:39| so that we can then house the next, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14679)|
| 4:04:43| So I'm not explaining that very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14683)|
| 4:04:46| but I think there's two levels of housing need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14686)|
| 4:04:50| that we need to be considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14690)|
| 4:04:52| The permanent supportive housing for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14692)|
| 4:04:54| who are gonna need ongoing case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14694)|
| 4:04:57| for the duration of that housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14697)|
| 4:04:59| but then also rapid rehousing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14699)|
| 4:05:01| where we're just providing case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14701)|
| 4:05:06| and that person will be quite stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14706)|
| 4:05:09| without case management going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14709)|
| 4:05:11| once they're established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14711)|
| 4:05:14| In terms of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14714)|
| 4:05:19| that we currently offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14719)|
| 4:05:21| Minvella Manor we opened in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14721)|
| 4:05:26| that's 57 units of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14726)|
| 4:05:29| There were some questions earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14729)|
| 4:05:32| about how long people stay in permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14732)|
| 4:05:37| So out of the 57 tenants that we have currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14737)|
| 4:05:42| 26 of them have been there for five years or longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14742)|
| 4:05:46| And over the, I guess going on 11 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14746)|
| 4:05:50| that we have been open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14750)|
| 4:05:52| we've only served a total of 184 tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14752)|
| 4:06:01| the 57 units and 184 tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14761)|
| 4:06:05| because it's a stable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| We're not, it's not turning over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14767)|
| 4:06:10| and it's great for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14770)|
| 4:06:12| that's great for the person who was chronically homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14772)|
| 4:06:15| and maybe I know some of the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14775)|
| 4:06:18| that live at Minvella now were homeless for 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14778)|
| 4:06:21| before they became housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14781)|
| 4:06:26| But that also means that you then have to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14786)|
| 4:06:29| more permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14789)|
| 4:06:33| because there's not a great deal of turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14793)|
| 4:06:35| because the more successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14795)|
| 4:06:38| your permanent supportive housing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14798)|
| 4:06:41| the fewer vacancies you're gonna have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14801)|
| 4:06:44| It's been mentioned we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14804)|
| 4:06:47| we've got a Caswell Manor in development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14807)|
| 4:06:51| that will be 48 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14811)|
| 4:06:53| It is over off of East 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14813)|
| 4:06:57| there by Caswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14817)|
| 4:07:00| And we are anticipating that that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14820)|
| 4:07:03| will be complete in June of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14823)|
| 4:07:08| And that we hope to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14828)|
| 4:07:10| we're planning to be fully leased up by October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14830)|
| 4:07:15| And we can do that through the CHAMP system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14835)|
| 4:07:17| because there are clearly plenty of folks that qualify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14837)|
| 4:07:21| plenty of folks who need that level of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14841)|
| 4:07:27| And we'll be able to fill those units quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14847)|
| 4:07:31| Other folks on the call have mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14851)|
| 4:07:35| the need to do prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14855)|
| 4:07:38| that we've got particularly in light of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14858)|
| 4:07:41| a lot of folks who are having difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14861)|
| 4:07:43| paying rent and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14863)|
| 4:07:44| And so we offer that service as well through the Refuge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14864)|
| 4:07:49| We do have some COVID specific funds recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14869)|
| 4:07:56| but we have always done rent and utility assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14876)|
| 4:07:59| through the Refuge just for folks who are low income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14879)|
| 4:08:03| and need that little bit of help to prevent an eviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14883)|
| 4:08:08| And then the guest house, again, as has been mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14888)|
| 4:08:13| we opened a guest house in, I believe, April of last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14893)|
| 4:08:21| and it's been at three different locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14901)|
| 4:08:24| because of various factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14904)|
| 4:08:27| And we've served a total of 124 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14907)|
| 4:08:33| I guess I will leave it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14913)|
| 4:08:35| Questions later, I can take some now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14915)|
| 4:08:41| Great, thanks, Gabe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14921)|
| 4:08:43| To reiterate one of the points that Gabe made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14923)|
| 4:08:45| about that population of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14925)|
| 4:08:50| who kind of score in that rapid rehousing range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14930)|
| 4:08:54| The other reason why we need to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14934)|
| 4:08:57| that type of housing and moving people quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14937)|
| 4:08:59| into the guest house is because we're not doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14939)|
| 4:09:03| and moving people quickly into units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14943)|
| 4:09:06| is because we don't want that population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14946)|
| 4:09:08| to then turn into our chronically homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14948)|
| 4:09:11| that has additional needs due to some of the factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14951)|
| 4:09:15| and trauma they may deal with on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14955)|
| 4:09:18| or developing substance abuse issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14958)|
| 4:09:24| the length of time they're on the street as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14964)|
| 4:09:27| So-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14967)|
| 4:09:28| One other point that I wanted to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14968)|
| 4:09:33| relative to Council Member Smith's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14973)|
| 4:09:37| about the folks who might stay with somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14977)|
| 4:09:41| and then not and stay with somebody and then not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14981)|
| 4:09:45| Oftentimes those are folks who have more resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14985)|
| 4:09:48| than some of the folks that are on the street full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14988)|
| 4:09:55| on a chronic basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14995)|
| 4:09:57| And those are folks, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14997)|
| 4:09:58| that could be served through rapid rehousing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=14998)|
| 4:10:01| because ideally we could catch them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15001)|
| 4:10:07| in one of those episodes of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15007)|
| 4:10:11| get them into their own place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15011)|
| 4:10:12| and get them settled in that more permanent situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15012)|
| 4:10:19| Yeah, and if I just add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15019)|
| 4:10:21| you know, I'm at VMC every week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15021)|
| 4:10:25| and other folks that are waiting for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15025)|
| 4:10:29| you know, get lunch and other services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15029)|
| 4:10:33| for everybody here that all of these providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15033)|
| 4:10:35| that point of contact is a big deal too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15035)|
| 4:10:40| Just for talking about housing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15040)|
| 4:10:41| but human service connection while waiting is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15041)|
| 4:10:49| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15049)|
| 4:10:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15056)|
| 4:10:59| Awesome, anything else for Gabe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15059)|
| 4:11:03| Great, thank you, Gabe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15063)|
| 4:11:08| Last, we have Misty Goodwin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15068)|
| 4:11:10| with the Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15070)|
| 4:11:16| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15076)|
| 4:11:18| Well, I hate to be last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15078)|
| 4:11:19| I'm going to try to make it very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15079)|
| 4:11:23| We do a lot at CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15083)|
| 4:11:25| and as you've heard this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15085)|
| 4:11:27| you know, there's a lot going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15087)|
| 4:11:28| that's sort of behind the scenes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15088)|
| 4:11:30| that everyone doesn't necessarily see every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15090)|
| 4:11:32| and a lot of work that goes into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15092)|
| 4:11:35| I know certainly CAC puts a lot into it every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15095)|
| 4:11:40| just as everyone else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15100)|
| 4:11:41| And so just wanted to highlight a few of our programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15101)|
| 4:11:47| through Homeward Bound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15107)|
| 4:11:49| I'm the social services director at CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15109)|
| 4:11:52| And so not only am I over some of the homeless programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15112)|
| 4:11:56| but also our homeless prevention services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15116)|
| 4:11:59| through our neighborhood centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15119)|
| 4:12:00| So you heard Gabe touch on the homeless prevention piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15120)|
| 4:12:04| I'm going to talk just for a second about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15124)|
| 4:12:07| because that's such an important piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15127)|
| 4:12:10| to homelessness and ending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15130)|
| 4:12:12| I will start with our REACH program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15132)|
| 4:12:16| I know Officer Clinton mentioned a little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15136)|
| 4:12:17| that our guys, Carl and Roosevelt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15137)|
| 4:12:20| have been doing street outreach in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15140)|
| 4:12:24| for 22 plus years, a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15144)|
| 4:12:27| And so if you're out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15147)|
| 4:12:29| I have had the opportunity to go out with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15149)|
| 4:12:32| and it's really amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15152)|
| 4:12:38| Many people know Carl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15158)|
| 4:12:39| they will describe to you and tell you about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15159)|
| 4:12:43| And so it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15163)|
| 4:12:47| I think Officer Clinton mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15167)|
| 4:12:49| some of the people that they've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15169)|
| 4:12:51| and they've outreached to and provided assistance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15171)|
| 4:12:53| have been out there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15173)|
| 4:12:56| And so they continue to outreach and house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15176)|
| 4:13:01| Sometimes we house people and we do that once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15181)|
| 4:13:04| and that may not be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15184)|
| 4:13:05| and we might do it two or three more times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15185)|
| 4:13:07| but we really try not to give up on people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15187)|
| 4:13:11| and work with them and do everything we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15191)|
| 4:13:14| to keep them housed, but that's not always possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15194)|
| 4:13:17| As Chris mentioned, just through drug abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15197)|
| 4:13:21| some mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15201)|
| 4:13:24| some people just aren't always successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15204)|
| 4:13:27| but that's certainly all of our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15207)|
| 4:13:31| So with the REACH program right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15211)|
| 4:13:34| for years, we only had Carl and Roosevelt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15214)|
| 4:13:36| They were the two traditional street outreach workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15216)|
| 4:13:39| Just recently, this past year, we added another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15219)|
| 4:13:43| which is Scott Lopez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15223)|
| 4:13:44| And so he is funded through Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15224)|
| 4:13:47| They funded one case management position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15227)|
| 4:13:51| and his territory is more in the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15231)|
| 4:13:54| outside the city limits area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15234)|
| 4:13:57| but he already has a very full caseload| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15237)|
| 4:13:59| and is getting many, many referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15239)|
| 4:14:00| Just the folks that are living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15240)|
| 4:14:02| have been living in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15242)|
| 4:14:03| or starting to move out into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15243)|
| 4:14:06| And so we're working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15246)|
| 4:14:10| Carl and Roosevelt have sort of covered the whole area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15250)|
| 4:14:13| for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15253)|
| 4:14:15| So it's nice to have another set of just boots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15255)|
| 4:14:17| on the ground to help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15257)|
| 4:14:18| So on average, we serve about four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15258)|
| 4:14:21| the guys do outreach to about 400 all over in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15261)|
| 4:14:24| And usually we house 80, at least every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15264)|
| 4:14:29| Sometimes that fluctuates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15269)|
| 4:14:32| but that is typically the goal is 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15272)|
| 4:14:34| I will say during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15274)|
| 4:14:35| all of our programs have housed less people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15275)|
| 4:14:40| just because of the barriers to housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15280)|
| 4:14:42| and just losing contact with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15282)|
| 4:14:43| So our families in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15283)|
| 4:14:45| we work with families who are literally homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15285)|
| 4:14:48| who are living on the streets, in their cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15288)|
| 4:14:53| living in the shelters that we partner with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15293)|
| 4:14:57| We work very closely with Salvation Army, Family Promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15297)|
| 4:15:01| and the Family Crisis Center to just try to house families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15301)|
| 4:15:05| from those various shelters and pay the deposits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15305)|
| 4:15:08| and the utilities and the back of rearages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15308)|
| 4:15:13| if somebody owes that, we can help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15313)|
| 4:15:15| So on average, we serve about 200 families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15315)|
| 4:15:18| through that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15318)|
| 4:15:19| And then with the goal of housing 100 families every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15319)|
| 4:15:24| Since I have been with CAC, which has been almost 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15324)|
| 4:15:30| we have never not met that goal of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15330)|
| 4:15:33| that 100 families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15333)|
| 4:15:36| So on that staff for families in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15336)|
| 4:15:39| we have four case managers that are funded through COC funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15339)|
| 4:15:42| and just recently during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15342)|
| 4:15:44| we saw a real rise in the number of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15344)|
| 4:15:47| that were coming through for services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15347)|
| 4:15:48| that were literally homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15348)|
| 4:15:51| Some of those families that didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15351)|
| 4:15:53| about the moratorium on evictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15353)|
| 4:15:55| that landlords were pressuring to move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15355)|
| 4:15:59| So some did, some were living with others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15359)|
| 4:16:02| and were in overcrowded situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15362)|
| 4:16:04| So found themselves in their cars during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15364)|
| 4:16:07| So we served an additional 69 families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15367)|
| 4:16:10| on top of our normal 200 during 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15370)|
| 4:16:14| And as a sort of response to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15374)|
| 4:16:17| we decided to request additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15377)|
| 4:16:20| through the city, through ESGCB funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15380)|
| 4:16:23| to add an additional case manager to our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15383)|
| 4:16:25| who is starting next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15385)|
| 4:16:27| So Elizabeth Holmes is a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15387)|
| 4:16:31| that is a longer term case management program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15391)|
| 4:16:35| We serve traditionally around 22 families annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15395)|
| 4:16:39| We pay up to two years of rental assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15399)|
| 4:16:42| through those, and again, that's COC funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15402)|
| 4:16:46| and then provide that long-term case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15406)|
| 4:16:48| We work with families who really want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15408)|
| 4:16:50| to maybe go back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15410)|
| 4:16:53| They want to just look for a promotion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15413)|
| 4:16:57| try to increase their wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15417)|
| 4:16:59| And the goal there would be to help people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15419)|
| 4:17:03| get into housing, pay their rent for up to two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15423)|
| 4:17:06| and then after that two years, let them pay on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15426)|
| 4:17:11| get them to a situation where they have enough income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15431)|
| 4:17:13| that they can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15433)|
| 4:17:13| So it's definitely the rehousing model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15433)|
| 4:17:18| that traditionally, with paying long-term rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15438)|
| 4:17:22| that is the one program we have that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15442)|
| 4:17:24| And so we are piloting another initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15444)|
| 4:17:28| doing rehousing with families and partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15448)|
| 4:17:30| As Gabe mentioned, they're doing that at VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15450)|
| 4:17:32| We're doing that with families with Drew and KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15452)|
| 4:17:35| and trying that, and that's sort of gonna fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15455)|
| 4:17:38| under the Elizabeth Holmes umbrella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15458)|
| 4:17:41| when we start that this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15461)|
| 4:17:44| In addition, we do YouthWIN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15464)|
| 4:17:46| Some of you may have heard about our homeless youth program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15466)|
| 4:17:50| Just quickly, we started that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15470)|
| 4:17:52| We got a call from a principal at Halls High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15472)|
| 4:17:55| about two kids that were camping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15475)|
| 4:17:56| out beside the school in a tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15476)|
| 4:17:59| They called us to say, what can you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15479)|
| 4:18:02| We really didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15482)|
| 4:18:03| We'd not gotten that call before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15483)|
| 4:18:04| So we sent Annette Beebe out to visit with those two kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15484)|
| 4:18:08| And what we found is there was very limited resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15488)|
| 4:18:11| since the runaway shelter closed in Knoxville for youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15491)|
| 4:18:15| aside from McNabb and the work that they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15495)|
| 4:18:18| but no youth-specific shelter besides McNabb's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15498)|
| 4:18:22| And so it was the start of YouthWIN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15502)|
| 4:18:25| And since then, now we have three case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15505)|
| 4:18:27| That's funded through our Community Service Block Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15507)|
| 4:18:30| that CAC operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15510)|
| 4:18:31| A lot of our programs from ESG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15511)|
| 4:18:34| the city supports one position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15514)|
| 4:18:36| and then United Way supports one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15516)|
| 4:18:39| And we just recently asked the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15519)|
| 4:18:41| to fund one other position for homeless youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15521)|
| 4:18:44| so we can do that intensive case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15524)|
| 4:18:46| to house more youth than what we currently are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15526)|
| 4:18:50| We traditionally serve about 125 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15530)|
| 4:18:53| This year we housed 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15533)|
| 4:18:55| And Sean, if you can get me to that next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15535)|
| 4:19:01| So I know during the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15541)|
| 4:19:06| one of our concerns was the limited number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15546)|
| 4:19:08| of shelter beds available to families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15548)|
| 4:19:11| That's a big deficit in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15551)|
| 4:19:15| As you saw earlier, there's 20 shelter beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15555)|
| 4:19:18| available for families in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15558)|
| 4:19:21| And I saw there was five transitional housing beds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15561)|
| 4:19:25| So I guess 25 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15565)|
| 4:19:28| Obviously not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15568)|
| 4:19:29| So that is why on average we see around 25 families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15569)|
| 4:19:35| that were living in their cars each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15575)|
| 4:19:37| And the pandemic was certainly increasing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15577)|
| 4:19:41| So we looked to the city and requested funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15581)|
| 4:19:45| for emergency hotel under the ESG grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15585)|
| 4:19:48| and received those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15588)|
| 4:19:50| And we have been working as we get calls from families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15590)|
| 4:19:52| who are literally homeless and in their cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15592)|
| 4:19:54| and they need somewhere to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15594)|
| 4:19:56| we are placing them in the hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15596)|
| 4:19:57| and then working with them on permanent housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15597)|
| 4:20:00| to help them secure housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15600)|
| 4:20:02| In addition, we are working with youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15602)|
| 4:20:06| to put them in hotels because again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15606)|
| 4:20:08| we were focused on those populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15608)|
| 4:20:11| that have limited shelter specific services to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15611)|
| 4:20:15| And that is seniors, families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15615)|
| 4:20:19| families, and then youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15619)|
| 4:20:21| And so today you can see our numbers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15621)|
| 4:20:23| We've served 41 households through that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15623)|
| 4:20:26| Nine of those were youth, five were senior households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15626)|
| 4:20:30| And so far 25 of those have exited to permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15630)|
| 4:20:34| And so it's been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15634)|
| 4:20:36| We've gotten a lot of calls that have not been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15636)|
| 4:20:40| people that are falling into those categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15640)|
| 4:20:43| So not families, not youth, not seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15643)|
| 4:20:46| And that really has been our focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15646)|
| 4:20:47| since there are shelter options for many of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15647)|
| 4:20:52| the singles that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15652)|
| 4:20:55| So we were just trying to limit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15655)|
| 4:20:56| to the people that we serve and can get outcomes with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15656)|
| 4:20:59| And that is actually one of the HUD requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15659)|
| 4:21:02| is that there can't be other shelter space available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15662)|
| 4:21:05| Quickly, Project Live is our program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15665)|
| 4:21:08| that works with seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15668)|
| 4:21:09| Many years back, APS, Adult Protection Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15669)|
| 4:21:14| made a decision that they were not going to be working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15674)|
| 4:21:18| with people who were not housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15678)|
| 4:21:20| And so that was not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15680)|
| 4:21:21| that they provided assistance with, was the housing piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15681)|
| 4:21:25| So the Office on Aging and the Project Live program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15685)|
| 4:21:28| started getting a lot of calls from seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15688)|
| 4:21:30| who were homeless that were too frail or vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15690)|
| 4:21:32| really to stay at CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15692)|
| 4:21:35| just because they're not set up really to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15695)|
| 4:21:38| Samaritan Place is our shelter here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15698)|
| 4:21:42| and we partner with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15702)|
| 4:21:43| So we provide the rehousing piece to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15703)|
| 4:21:45| We move the seniors into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15705)|
| 4:21:47| and pay for them to go into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15707)|
| 4:21:49| And then that frees up beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15709)|
| 4:21:50| for us to place additional seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15710)|
| 4:21:53| And so that program has really grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15713)|
| 4:21:57| We fund one of the positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15717)|
| 4:22:02| with Community Service Block Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15722)|
| 4:22:03| And just recently, the city gave us additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15723)|
| 4:22:07| through the rehousing program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15727)|
| 4:22:08| to fund one additional case manager to help those seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15728)|
| 4:22:12| During the pandemic, just because they're so vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15732)|
| 4:22:15| and we wanted to be sure we had enough boots on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15735)|
| 4:22:18| to get those seniors housed quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15738)|
| 4:22:20| So as you see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15740)|
| 4:22:21| we serve about 100 seniors that are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15741)|
| 4:22:23| We really try to focus on those that are really vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15743)|
| 4:22:26| and can't stay at CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15746)|
| 4:22:29| and work to place them in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15749)|
| 4:22:32| And over the past two years, we've housed 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15752)|
| 4:22:36| And that has been true this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15756)|
| 4:22:38| Even during COVID, we've been able to house 80 seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15758)|
| 4:22:43| And just quickly, as I started to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15763)|
| 4:22:45| was just Homeless Prevention Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15765)|
| 4:22:47| I know Gabe touched on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15767)|
| 4:22:48| and we too have been doing a lot of assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15768)|
| 4:22:51| around people who've been affected by COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15771)|
| 4:22:55| who have lost their jobs, lost their incomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15775)|
| 4:22:58| and needed utility assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15778)|
| 4:23:00| mortgage assistance, rental assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15780)|
| 4:23:04| So we have assisted 515 households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15784)|
| 4:23:07| with rental assistance during the pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15787)|
| 4:23:09| and had two very large utility assistance programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15789)|
| 4:23:13| where we have paid, as of today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15793)|
| 4:23:16| 5,275 households have received utility assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15796)|
| 4:23:21| And so, and we've spent over $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15801)|
| 4:23:24| just paying utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15804)|
| 4:23:27| And so that's all part of keeping people housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15807)|
| 4:23:30| Last thing I just wanted to mention was back in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15810)|
| 4:23:34| we, under the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15814)|
| 4:23:36| we started the, what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15816)|
| 4:23:38| the CAC Case Management Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15818)|
| 4:23:41| And that is a partnership with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15821)|
| 4:23:43| I know Matt touched on that briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15823)|
| 4:23:45| and it is a really successful model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15825)|
| 4:23:49| where I know back during the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15829)|
| 4:23:52| what KCDC and Mike and everyone was seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15832)|
| 4:23:57| was just people were going into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15837)|
| 4:23:59| and then coming out of housing at KCDC just as quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15839)|
| 4:24:03| And so the idea there is to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15843)|
| 4:24:05| those residents that are at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15845)|
| 4:24:07| The managers will make referrals to our case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15847)|
| 4:24:10| to say somebody's in trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15850)|
| 4:24:12| they're not paying their rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15852)|
| 4:24:13| they're not doing their housekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15853)|
| 4:24:15| they've got uninvited guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15855)|
| 4:24:16| And so we go in, provide case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15856)|
| 4:24:19| link them to resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15859)|
| 4:24:21| and try to keep them stably housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15861)|
| 4:24:24| And so since 2007, we have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15864)|
| 4:24:30| So those people that are engaged with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15870)|
| 4:24:32| and who really work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15872)|
| 4:24:35| and even if they get evicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15875)|
| 4:24:37| some people will, you know, they're on probation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15877)|
| 4:24:39| they do something and we can't control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15879)|
| 4:24:41| So not to say that people haven't been evicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15881)|
| 4:24:44| while they've been case managed by us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15884)|
| 4:24:46| but what we do is rehouse them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15886)|
| 4:24:48| And so if they work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15888)|
| 4:24:49| we will find them score to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15889)|
| 4:24:50| so they're not evicted to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15890)|
| 4:24:52| And so it's been a very successful model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15892)|
| 4:24:55| On average, we serve about 200 residents every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15895)|
| 4:24:58| I know right now on our caseloads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15898)|
| 4:24:59| we have about 237 residents on our caseloads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15899)|
| 4:25:03| that we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15903)|
| 4:25:05| And not all of those are, you know, active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15905)|
| 4:25:07| but we're just kind of keeping our eye on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15907)|
| 4:25:10| to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15910)|
| 4:25:11| they're doing what's needed to keep their housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15911)|
| 4:25:14| So they are at Northgate, Cagle, Love Towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15914)|
| 4:25:19| and Isabella Towers are the four properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15919)|
| 4:25:21| And we are located on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15921)|
| 4:25:24| So our offices are all located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15924)|
| 4:25:26| So we're, you know, available to all of those residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15926)|
| 4:25:30| when they need services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15930)|
| 4:25:33| I think that's all I've got to report on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15933)|
| 4:25:35| So if you all have questions, feel free to email me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15935)|
| 4:25:43| Great, thank you, Misty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15943)|
| 4:25:47| For the sake of time, we're gonna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15947)|
| 4:25:49| Mike and I are gonna pick up the pace a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15949)|
| 4:25:51| and work through our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15951)|
| 4:25:54| Obviously, council, if you do have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15954)|
| 4:25:56| please interject and let us know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15956)|
| 4:25:59| but we're gonna try and move through this last piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15959)|
| 4:26:01| pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15961)|
| 4:26:05| I just wanted to make sure, did Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15965)|
| 4:26:08| did you, I know you popped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15968)|
| 4:26:10| I just wanted to make sure you didn't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15970)|
| 4:26:14| Well, I'm not sure how long is this particular section here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15974)|
| 4:26:19| I don't necessarily want you to have to rush through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15979)|
| 4:26:21| So council may wanna take a brief 10 minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15981)|
| 4:26:27| We have about six slides left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15987)|
| 4:26:34| Council, is there anyone that would like to take a break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15994)|
| 4:26:37| or do we wanna power through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15997)|
| 4:26:38| Yes, Vice Mayor, I would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=15998)|
| 4:26:40| because I know there's public forum after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16000)|
| 4:26:43| Okay, that sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16003)|
| 4:26:44| Well, let's take a 10 minute break then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16004)|
| 4:26:47| and come back at 15 till.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16007)|
| 4:26:50| Well, we can be five, we can run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16010)|
| 4:26:53| I think five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16013)|
| 4:26:55| We do 10, we can do 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16015)|
| 4:26:57| No, I'm gonna stick with please 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16017)|
| 4:26:59| Okay, 10, okay, let's come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16019)|
| 4:27:04| Okay, we'll go now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16024)|
| 4:27:06| So I'll see everybody back a little like 12 minutes till.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16026)|
| 4:27:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16032)|
| 4:27:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16034)|
| 4:27:15| All right, Mr. Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16035)|
| 4:27:16| I think and Deputy Chief Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16036)|
| 4:27:19| we'll go ahead and finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16039)|
| 4:27:21| Shawn, if you wanna take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16041)|
| 4:27:25| Yes, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16045)|
| 4:27:29| All right, thank you everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16049)|
| 4:27:33| Now we're gonna shift to the Office on Homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16053)|
| 4:27:36| and our priorities to address gaps in services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16056)|
| 4:27:39| and resources moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16059)|
| 4:27:41| and innovative ways to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16061)|
| 4:27:46| Priority number one is the Street Outreach Coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16066)|
| 4:27:51| So what we're trying to do in the Office on Homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16071)|
| 4:27:56| now is create a centralized complaint system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16076)|
| 4:28:00| where essentially all the complaint data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16080)|
| 4:28:03| from all the different departments across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16083)|
| 4:28:06| comes into one area for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16086)|
| 4:28:11| One, we're really trying to figure out the breadth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16091)|
| 4:28:14| and volume across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16094)|
| 4:28:17| of how many complaints we're receiving as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16097)|
| 4:28:21| and then the best way to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16101)|
| 4:28:23| And then two, the intent is to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16103)|
| 4:28:26| social service interaction and decrease KPD interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16106)|
| 4:28:31| And so what this looks like is complaints come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16111)|
| 4:28:35| and I'm collaborating with our street outreach teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16115)|
| 4:28:39| and I'm referring those complaints to those teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16119)|
| 4:28:42| to go and visit those camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16122)|
| 4:28:44| so that we can have an initial street outreach interaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16124)|
| 4:28:47| and social service presence at those camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16127)|
| 4:28:49| as quickly as possible and then to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16129)|
| 4:28:52| that interaction for as long as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16132)|
| 4:28:58| because one of the best ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16138)|
| 4:28:59| to make street outreach effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16139)|
| 4:29:03| is to have one, consistent engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16143)|
| 4:29:06| and two, with that consistent engagement build rapport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16146)|
| 4:29:10| with their unsheltered homeless population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16150)|
| 4:29:12| so that we can start to move them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16152)|
| 4:29:14| toward on the path to permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16154)|
| 4:29:19| The second piece of that is then to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16159)|
| 4:29:21| the co-responder model that Officer Clinton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16161)|
| 4:29:25| has currently and add more individuals to that team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16165)|
| 4:29:30| or add more individuals to that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16170)|
| 4:29:33| And this would really be to target the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16173)|
| 4:29:36| that we can't totally pull KPD away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16176)|
| 4:29:41| from the homelessness world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16181)|
| 4:29:43| KPD still needs to respond to issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16183)|
| 4:29:47| that have to do with safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16187)|
| 4:29:49| issues that have to do with private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16189)|
| 4:29:52| and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16192)|
| 4:29:53| And so by expanding the co-responder model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16193)|
| 4:29:55| we would be able to increase the number of interactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16195)|
| 4:29:59| that individuals are having with social service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16199)|
| 4:30:04| by having them paired with KPD officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16204)|
| 4:30:08| And so again, it comes back to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16208)|
| 4:30:10| that I've been kind of getting at multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16210)|
| 4:30:13| which is we wanna increase points of engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16213)|
| 4:30:16| and points of entry into our coordinated entry system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16216)|
| 4:30:20| and really just be hitting people as many times as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16220)|
| 4:30:26| and engaging them and trying to have conversations with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16226)|
| 4:30:29| and building rapport so that we can move them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16229)|
| 4:30:32| toward a pathway to permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16232)|
| 4:30:36| And then the next piece of this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16236)|
| 4:30:37| to digitize CHAMP assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16237)|
| 4:30:40| for mobile device compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16240)|
| 4:30:42| and give our outreach teams a more efficient way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16242)|
| 4:30:47| to assess unsheltered homeless in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16247)|
| 4:30:50| And we would need to provide them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16250)|
| 4:30:52| with the necessary equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16252)|
| 4:30:53| as well as the technology to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16253)|
| 4:30:58| and to adapt this assessment to a mobile platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16258)|
| 4:31:02| And again, all of this is tied to making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16262)|
| 4:31:05| that we can increase the number of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16265)|
| 4:31:09| we can get unsheltered homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16269)|
| 4:31:10| into our coordinated entry system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210318?start=16270)|
