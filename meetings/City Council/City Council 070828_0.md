| 0:26:37| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1597)|

| 0:26:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| All those against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| If you would just leave, Martha, we'll pass them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| If you could hold talking until you get back to the microphone and we'll pass them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1610)|
| 0:27:05| In addition to the seven stipulations, which involve withdrawal of part of the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| request, we would agree under paragraph two, and I will interline that and furnish that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1632)|
| 0:27:19| to the city recorder and to Mr. Donaldson, an MPC, that no storage units will be erected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| over two stories on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| And that would just go at the end of number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| I hope, with that addition, we are in agreement with Ms. Mauer and some of her neighbors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1654)|
| 0:27:42| And I will read those into the record, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Number one, Bethel development will leave undisturbed as many trees and as much vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| as possible on the north side of the property where the warehouses will be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1669)|
| 0:27:54| Two storage units will not be erected over one story unless a brick facade is placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| at the end facing Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Brian, it is not anticipated at this time that any units will be over one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| I would add after that no units will exceed two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| Number three, Bethel development will not build storage units on the church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| Number four, security lighting for the warehouses will be directed away from any residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Bethel development anticipates that sensor lights will be used, however, those will only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| be activated by intruders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Number five, no boats, trailers, mobile homes, motorcycles, or RVs will be visible from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| Bridgewater Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| Number six, assuming Comstock Road can be officially closed and it appears to be a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| road, the gate at the entrance will be relocated closer to Bridgewater Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| Number seven, other than the parcels discussed, the church property will not be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| I would ask that these be included in the record and that the motion, if council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| inclined to approve this, would incorporate these in the motion and request that the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| staff use these or enforce these during the C6 review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| The zoning that we are asking for, C6, requires site plan review by the professional staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1753)|
| 0:29:21| and MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| And I think the ordinance has just been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| If anyone is dissatisfied with that approval, it goes to the Board of Zoning Appeal or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| the full planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| I knew there was an amendment underway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| With that, we would ask approval of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| Does Mr. Bethel want to speak as well or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| No, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Ms. Maurer, could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| Sue Maurer, 8824 Farmington Drive, Crestwood Hills, president of Crestwood Hills Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1790)|
| 0:29:58| This has been a real struggle, believe me, in trying to get this passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| I was down here before and, of course, this is the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| We have been concerned from day one about the height of these buildings, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| as of tonight, upon arriving here, Arthur has assured us the height would not be any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| higher than two-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| We will concede with that as long as they give us the facade and the landscaping and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| so forth to protect the neighborhood from these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| And I hope that this will work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| We appreciate your help, and I appreciate all the conversation that I've had with different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| ones here on the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| But this has been a very hard struggle because it is at the entrance to our subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| and we certainly want to keep this as a nice entrance because I know nobody here would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| like to have it at their subdivision entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| However, as long as they keep it in the back part and give us the vegetation, the trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| keep it the way it is, hopefully this will be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Are we ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Also, Ed Hester had signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Are you okay, Ed, or do you want to ... Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| I'll hold now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| If you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| My name is Ed Hester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| I'm a resident of 28 years for Crestwood Hills Subdivision, and just like our president said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| we just want to make sure of the integrity of the entrance of our subdivision, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| is heavily traveled down from I-40 and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| We learned tonight, as Ms. Meyer said, that we do have assurance from the owner that there will be a two-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1899)|
| 0:31:51| I was prepared to say some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| However, I don't think they're pertinent now except to say that we, I guess by now it's very obvious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1913)|
| 0:32:01| want to protect the integrity of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| I think it's clear that we want to work with the folks that are wanting to do this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| but at the same time we want to make sure that we speak in behalf of all of our residents of Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1931)|
| 0:32:19| And I guess the big thing I would say is if this does work out for the two stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| that we need to make sure that all of this is clearly dispelled out in writing so that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| the residents, know for sure that this will go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Beyond that, I don't have anything else to say except that we do appreciate this negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Well, I just wanted to comment, if all the public comments have been concluded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| that I really want to thank, well, I particularly want to thank the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| This is one of those situations where we have some property that has long been annexed into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| has never been developed, and we have a city street that is just really kind of a little street in name only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| And we have some developers who were interested in a development there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| and were kind enough to meet with me and for us to look at the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| talk about some of the challenges and talk about this neighborhood, which actually resides in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=1999)|
| 0:33:27| and some of their concerns and some of the sensitivity that they feel about the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| And from the get-go, I think, which was several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| when I met with their engineer and a couple of people from the development firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| made it clear that there were certain issues that just needed to be resolved prior to bringing it to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| So to their credit, to the credit of this development company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| they have been willing to consider the conditions that are appropriate, I think, for this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| which is although it's along the interstate and a very challenging area to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| it also provides an entrance to a long-standing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| And they have been willing to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| And Mr. Seymour has spent an enormous amount of time on the behalf of both groups, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| to try to find the best resolution we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| And this is the kind of thing I like for us to see is for everyone to be able to have open discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| and work through their issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| And I believe this evening we're seeing that that has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| So I want to commend you all for the efforts on behalf of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| because it just makes our work a lot clearer and a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| So thank you so very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| Now, I have a motion that I'm prepared to read if we are ready to take the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| We need an original motion first before we move to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| There's no motion on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| Now we can take a motion to amend if you would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| The original motion, I think, I'm not sure if this is a motion to amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| or if this is the original motion with an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| Mr. Seymour, will you assist me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| The motion that the council passed on first reading with one addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| I think we're going to want to move to amend with the additions that was given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| the stipulations that you handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Is that right, Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| And completion of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| And since it's a very complicated motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| I think it's wise that we read it to get it in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| And I can pass it out to each council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Why don't you go ahead and read it, Ms. Pila, while Mr. Seymour is passing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| This would be the motion on 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| I make a motion that section 1 of the proposed ordinance be amended as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| The one-year comprehensive development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| and zoning plan for the city of Knoxville dated 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| and adopted by ordinance number 0-8407| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| is hereby amended so as to delete the classification low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| and medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| and to substitute in lieu of the classification general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| for the following properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| parcel 119LA017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| parcel 119LA015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| located in a generally westerly direction from Bridgewater Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| and a parcel of land five feet wide parallel to the southern boundary of Comstock Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| and a parcel of land approximately 4,000 square feet at the southwest corner of Comstock Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| and Bridgewater Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Steve Bethel applicant file number 7-D-07-PA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| That was the motion to amend right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Are there discussions on the amendment at this point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| Are we ready to vote on that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| I'm sorry, Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| I think everyone knows this, but I think I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| Just to clarify, though, we're now amending the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| and the stipulations as put before us will come in the next part on rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| so I think this is all we need for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| This is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| All those in favor of the amendment, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Any discussion on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| And now I will make a motion on 9-P if that is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| Do we need to read it first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| Ms. Mitchell, why don't we let her read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| 9-P is an ordinance to rezone property from R1 low-density residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| R2 general residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| and RP1 planned residential district at a density of 6 to 12 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| to 6C6 general commercial park district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| property located on the northwest and southeast sides of Comstock Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| southwest side of Bridgewater Road, Steve Bethel, applicant, second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Ms. Pilow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Now I would make a motion to amend and it states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| that Section 1 of the proposed ordinance be amended as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| The zoning ordinance of the City of Knoxville being Ordinance No. 3369B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| and the same hereby is amended so as to change the classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| of the following described property from R1 low-density residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| R2 general residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| and RP1 planned residential district at a density of 6 to 12 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| to C6 general commercial park district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| which property is more properly described as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Parcel 119LA017, parcel 119LA015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| located in a generally westerly direction from Bridgewater Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| and a parcel of land five feet wide parallel to the southern boundary of Comstock Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| and a parcel of land approximately 4,000 square feet at the southwest corner of Comstock Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| and Bridgewater Road, second district, northwest county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| I further move that the stipulations agreed to by Bethel Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| be incorporated with the C6 review by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| The stipulations are, one, Bethel Development will leave undisturbed as many trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| and as much vegetation as possible on the north side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| where the warehouses will be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| Two, storage units will not be erected over one story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| unless a brick facade is placed at the end facing Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| It is not anticipated at this time that any units will be over one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| However, none of the units are to go over two stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| and that's kind of my verbiage because that was an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| We can correct that if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Three, Bethel Development will not build storage units on the church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| Four, security lighting for the warehouses will be directed away from any residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| Bethel Development anticipates that sensor lights will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| However, those will only be activated by intruders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| Five, no boats, trailers, mobile homes, motorcycles, or RVs will be visible from Bridgewater Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| Six, assuming Comstock Road can be officially closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| the gate at the entrance will be relocated closer to Bridgewater Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| Seven, other than the parcels discussed, the church property will not be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Motion to amend and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| I guess I'd like clarification on a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| First of all, these are in the motion are mentioned as stipulations to be incorporated with the C6 review by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2441)|
| 0:40:56| Would that be the same as describing them as conditions of the rezoning, Mr. Sorensen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| No, it wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| That was my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| These are functionally just recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Stipulations of the parties that are being forwarded to MPC for their consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| when they approve or disapprove under the planned commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| But the ultimate decision lies with the Metropolitan Planning Commission with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| And actually with the staff, but it can be appealed to the full MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| That action, clarify this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| I know we just approved that on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| If the MPC were to hear an appeal, is that appealable to this council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| I think that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| I would clarify that with Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| but I believe that any action in that regard would be appealable to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| There's a general statement in the zoning ordinance that any commission action is appealable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Other than subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| Well, I mean, I just want to be clear that we're not conditioning this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| We could, but we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| And is there a reason why we're not just putting these on the zonings as conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| I believe Mr. Swanson can explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| Frankly, the issue of conditional zoning is still, in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| an issue that has not been firmly resolved by the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| There is some dicta that suggests that conditional zoning is something that can be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| But unless and until we have a case where that actually is faced by the court and dealt with by the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| because all previous cases that have dealt with the issue of conditional zoning in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2559)|
| 0:42:47| have determined that conditional zoning is not something that is permitted in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| And then we come along and have this one case before the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court says you can do conditional zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| but it doesn't matter to that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| It's just kind of an advisory opinion given by the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| So I think there is a very minimal comfort level with the ability of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2582)|
| 0:43:13| or any legislative body to engage in conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| And so under those circumstances, I think you don't want to rely on that too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2598)|
| 0:43:26| Does this mean, Mr. Swanson, that you're not prepared to argue a case before the Tennessee Supreme Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| I argue every case you all ask me to argue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| You pass it with five votes, I'll go argue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| I kind of think this was our effort to give the most assurance we could to the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| And at the same time, you know, stipulate to the point that we can within the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| And knowing that MPC would realize that by the stipulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| we had been very hoping they will feel we've been very convincing about our wishes as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| It's an attempt to impress upon them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| But just for clarification purposes, those are not conditions on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| A couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| One concern I have is ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| And I see number one as sort of ambiguous concerning protection of trees and vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2658)|
| 0:44:27| I realize that's a difficult thing unless you survey off an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| and say this area will be left untouched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| But ambiguity sometimes makes it difficult for all parties involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| because any time there's ambiguity, one party can have one understanding of what that means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| another party can have another understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| and you can end up with everybody being unhappy with the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| And so I'm a little concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| I'm not sure that there's anything further we can do about that, but I am a little concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| Also on number three, it says Bethel Development will not build storage units on the church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| Well, the church property is not under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| So I don't see how that has any bearing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| It does not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| But initially when these stipulations were being created and developed and worked through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| that was a big concern of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| And if you recall, at the meeting two weeks ago, that property was removed from the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| I remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| It could well have been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| So that was one of the very important points to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| which everyone wanted to make clear would not be violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| Oh, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| It's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| But that's why I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| That property still is to be considered for rezoning at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| And that goes to number seven, which says other than the parcels discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| the church property will not be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| Again, we can't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| You know, that is a separate legislative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Just want to point those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| I'm not a little discomfort with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Number one, number three and number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| Did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| You OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Ready to vote then on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2781)|

| 0:47:36| There is someone signed up to speak originally for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2856)|

| 0:47:43| deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2864)|

| 0:47:53| Now's not the time to start denying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| Maybe y'all want to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| You're recommending a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2878)|

| 0:48:16| Motion's been withdrawn and the second has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Right now there's no motion on the floor at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| Becker, I feel that I understand what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2909)|

| 0:48:33| King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| You should have seen what happened to me last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| Well, if you're OK with it, then notice everyone's giving you a wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| berth tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| I suppose I could ask whether I could speak in the absence of a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| King, would you please speak to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Can we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Can we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| King, can you speak for two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2940)|

| 0:49:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| This request is for reversal of a decision of administrative officer as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2949)|
| 0:49:21| the interpretation that this proposed facility is not permitted in an O-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| First of all, I want to say to you that staying at its current location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| rural metro, for rural metro is not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| There are solid reasons why they have to be within a certain location in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| order to meet the requirements of certain contracts they have as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| other national fire protection regulations, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=2988)|

| 0:50:34| statement, the establishments rendering services associated with the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| listed above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| And it doesn't say they actually have to provide it to those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| physically located in the area where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| It says that they provide service associated with those uses listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| Clearly, emergency service, ambulance service, first responder calls, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| fire service are services to be utilized by these types of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| I submit to you that it is, therefore, clear and appropriate that this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| adopt an interpretation that says that this use is, in fact, permitted in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| O-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| And I follow that up with my last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| You can read the city zoning ordinance from start to finish, and you will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| find a zoning classification that provides as a permitted use this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3088)|
| 0:51:35| fire station or emergency service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| It is clear, therefore, that an interpretation that says this is a permitted use in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| an O-zone is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| Knoxville, the city of Knoxville has fire stations and residentially zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| property, office zoned property, and other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| It is not, therefore, inconsistent with my interpretation and what I believe to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| the correct interpretation of the zoning ordinance that this is a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3118)|

| 0:52:12| Knox County tries to do likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3132)|

| 0:52:18| fact that it's part of the community, that they should be interested in providing service to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3138)|
| 0:52:25| and service for, includes Knox County, not just the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| I'd ask that somebody make a motion to approve this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3149)|

| 0:52:36| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Mayor Haslam, I just feel it incumbent upon me to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| The discussion regarding this possible use for this property has been ongoing for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Mr. Henley first contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| I believe he and I have a nice history of working out some business arrangements that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| he has needed, and it's been a perfectly agreeable use of that property within a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| When he called me about his interest in this particular development going on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| piece of property, I just reminded him of the location, reminded him of the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| area that was within the city and the confusion that this could very possibly cause for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| the residents of the city who would be leaving and knowing that they had an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3207)|
| 0:53:36| facility located in their community, but not maybe understanding that it could not serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| them, because this is a contract-only service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| And I discussed with him the fact that I felt that would bring a great deal of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| I also reminded him that his location is extremely close to a very busy intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| And also within a couple of blocks of a very busy school, which is very challenged with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| a very narrow, old county, two-lane road, which is now a city street, and of the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| that would bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| I already have one fire station located on Old Weisgarber, which has many challenges to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| access and exit that property when there's an emergency, and we've had to make all kinds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| of arrangements to try to put up postings, ask people not to pull into that access and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| exit area because it would block emergency vehicles from moving there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| We had those discussions, and I had rather felt that this would not come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| It has come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| I also am very aware that a location very near this location, which is in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| was turned down for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| I do not know by the county for rezoning for this fire station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3293)|
| 0:55:00| His comments to me were, it is so important, as you have heard Mr. King comment on, and he's so right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3300)|
| 0:55:08| These services are desperately needed by the people in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| They're desperately needed by people down Lions Bend and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| And that was Mr. Henley's comment to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| But, gosh, we've got such an obligation to take care of these folks in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| And I reminded him that they are going to have to drive through a very congested city area to reach these county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3322)|
| 0:55:31| locations, and I did not believe that they could reliably make their response times by doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| So I really recommended that they go on and find another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| I was then told that there had been a meeting with a number of city departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| and I was given a little bit different take on what occurred at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| So I made it a point to give a call to everybody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| And I think everyone in that meeting had some of the same concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| and feelings that this was not a good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| And, yes, we do have fire stations located in residential areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| and they are very welcome there and very treasured by the neighborhoods in which they are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| But, of course, those stations are all going to be responsive to all of the citizens in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3378)|
| 0:56:25| because they are city residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| And I regret to have to not support this, but it is simply the wrong place, the wrong time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| and just the wrong area for this particular facility to be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| So I'm prepared to make a motion that this appeal be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| Motion to deny. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| Okay. Is there further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| There was a second. Yes, over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| Okay. Ready to vote then? All those in favor, aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3417)|
| 0:57:06| 10B is an appeal by Damon Falconeer of the Board of Zoning Appeals' denial of a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| to reduce the minimum required parking from 61 spaces to 22 spaces per site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| to provide for expansion of the Seventh-day Adventist Church located at 5208 Ball Camp Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| in an O1 office medical and related services district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| in conjunction with 11W, which is a resolution approving the appeal by Damon Falconeer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3446)|
| 0:57:34| Move for approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Questions? Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| I was reviewing the transcript from the Board of Zoning Appeals meeting regarding this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| and even called a member of the BZA to talk with him about what exactly happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| And if I sorted it out correctly, the item that's being appealed has to do with parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| And evidently you have sufficient parking, but it's not paved. It's in a gravel area. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| I know you provided us with a map this evening. Do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| Yes. Does anybody need a copy? I laid several out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| Does anybody need a copy of that? I'll be glad to give you one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| See, no hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| What we've shown there is the existing parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| This used to be a church prior to it was another church before the Seventh-day Adventist Church bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| They have never occupied the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| And it kind of says the expansion, but technically they've never occupied the property at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| It's been sitting vacant since January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| But the existing spaces are 22 spaces now next to the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| And the proposal is that we build, as the church grows, right now there's about 60 in attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| as the church grows, that we would build a gravel parking up on the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| There's a sloping area in the back that's suitable for parking if it's gravel on that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3535)|
| 0:59:02| So we're recommending gravel parking there because we don't want to increase our impervious area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| because there's no place on the site for a detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| But this area does not have gravel yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3556)|
| 0:59:17| There's no need for it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3557)|
| 0:59:18| Have you had an engineer look at this in terms of how this, I understand there's slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| And the concern from BZA, if I understood the member I spoke with today, had to do with detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| and that perhaps this was a stopgap measure, as you said, to not provide detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| And I just want to make sure stormwater is a very important issue to the city of Knoxville that this is done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| I haven't been out to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| I haven't looked at the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| And I don't want to approve a, whatever it's called, a variance if it's going to cause downstream or adjacent property issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3583)|
| 0:59:54| I have met with Mr. Johnson of the city of Knoxville, and he is in agreement with what we have proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| Yeah, in the meantime, until the gravel lot gets filled, this is a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| and every now and then there are events that a lot of people show up at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| And I'm wondering where folks are going to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| Having looked at it, there is, I mean, it's on ball camp at Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| It's not like you can park on the street there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| And I'm wondering what would happen if more than 22 cars showed up at the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| If you'll look on your map there, the area in the back of the church is a grassy area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| It has some trees around the perimeter of it, so they would be able to park in the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3631)|
| 1:00:45| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| I'd like to hear from the district representative because I know he's been out and looked at it, and he supports this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| So I'd like to hear some more about it, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Well, you know, I've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| I drive by it twice a day because it's on my way back and forth to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| And, you know, it was an old school originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| It had said abandoned or would have some periodic use occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| And then one church bought it, and they did some stuff to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| But they never really, you know, like I said, I drive by it twice a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| I never saw the parking lot full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| And another church, when it goes in here, I can see the need for hopefully when it grows that the need will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| But in the back, it does have a slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| But once you go up the initial what you might call a bank, which is not very high, it's fairly level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3692)|
| 1:01:40| And there's not a whole lot of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| There's not any room toward the front of the building to put in type of detention that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3702)|
| 1:01:50| Were you out there with Mr. Johnson when he looked at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| I met with Mr. Falconer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| Mr. Swanson, in approving this variance for them to have fewer parking spaces than is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3716)|
| 1:02:04| and then they use an area that is to be graveled in the future in the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| if in the future someone decides to pave that over and then that creates detention issues, do we have any recourse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3729)|
| 1:02:21| In other words, we've approved fewer spaces than if they want to add space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| They're saying, well, we don't need to add spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| We don't need to pave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| But if someone does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| If they pave it in the future, is there a recourse because that creates greater runoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| I'm not aware of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Mr. Johnson, are you aware of any provisions that would provide relief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| I'm so used to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Mr. King, are you familiar with any provisions that would provide any relief to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| I don't think there would be any relief if they decided to pave the parking lot later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| They may be subject to our stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| And if a certain level of area is paved, then it could kick in a requirement for detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| I just think it's important that the applicant realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| And I support my colleague's support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| It's in his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| But, again, stormwater was addressed earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| and I just think it's very important that we make clear with every applicant that we're serious about this in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3803)|

| 1:04:51| I think we have several folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| Do you want to introduce them, Mr. Woodhull, or do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Michael Cain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Will you come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| Michael, you're the president of Fountain City Town Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| Yes, and I was the chairman of the skate park tax force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| Could you describe the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Because, really, we're acknowledging your very thorough and good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| First of all, Michael Cain, 3603 Kesterwood Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| Before we get started, I do want to recognize some other people that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| The task force members, if you would stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| We have several people from the task force who are here, and I want to appreciate their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| This has definitely been a community event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| We've got parents and outside community representatives from halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| We also have Stephen Collins and Dave Collins from McCarty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| who are Fountain City residents, and they helped out with the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| We also have our parents and the skaters themselves who helped with the design of our concept design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| Can you stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| And, of course, ultimately these are the benefits of the skate park as well as the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| Fountain City has a lot of skateboarders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| If you've ever driven along Broadway, you will see that there's a lot of skateboarders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| and that's how we got started with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| We actually had a Fountain City Town Hall meeting back in November of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| We invited the police, and all the discussion was about skateboarding in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| And so we had another meeting in January, and we formed the skate park task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| We came back with a recommendation for a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| The city had some concerns with that site in terms of city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| as well as some concerns that were raised right after that by some folks on Maple Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| And so we met with the Maple Drive folks in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| and they raised a lot of concerns with pedestrian traffic, also with crime and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4008)|
| 1:06:57| We went back and tried to evaluate how to mitigate those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| I met with Councilman Woodhull and Becker and went back and tried to look at our preferred location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| which was on the corner of Knox and Maple, which is further from the residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| And went back, and I want to thank city engineering for reevaluating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| and coming up with a way to use this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| and to assure that there won't be any additional stormwater into the First Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| which obviously is important for the Fountain City community as well as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| And we had a meeting with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| The task force had a final report back on August 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| and the only concern that was raised at the meeting was how the parking was going to be on the Maple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4059)|
| 1:07:49| But the person there realized we didn't have a lot of choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| and we'll try to do the best we can working through the final design with city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| to make sure all the concerns are addressed as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| Thank you, Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| I'm sorry, anything else from Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Do we have a rough design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Do we have anything on paper to show Council what we're talking about now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| It was in that packet that I had sent earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| There was the presentation, but I don't have copies for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| I can't pass out the one that we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| We've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| And then there's also a lot of ñ it's a great skate park, and it's going to be expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| And I'm wondering if you want to start out suggesting where people can send money to help build this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| and anything to help get it built is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| Well, also I forgot to mention that I want to thank Joe Walsh from City Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4118)|
| 1:08:44| for his support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| And, of course, this proposal is on city-owned land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| which is the biggest donation is to have it on city land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| Our conceptual estimate for this project is $130,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| and we realize that the city doesn't necessarily have that money currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| and we are very anxious to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| I believe the folks here keep on asking me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| And when were they going to get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| So we realize that we're going to have to raise money from the community through foundations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| through fundraising events, through all kinds of things, donations through anywhere we can get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4158)|
| 1:09:27| And the Legacy Parks Foundation is going to be the recipient of all our donations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| so that they will be charitable donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| And also Carol Evans, who's the director of Legacy Park Foundation, lives in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| and she's a neighbor of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| So it all works out just very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| Thanks, Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Oh, excuse me, Councilman Bynum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Who designed this skate park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| I know Wally Holiday designed the one over there in Tyson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| Well, the actual design has come from the skaters themselves with the help of Stephen Collins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| and Dave Collins with McCarty, a host of McCarty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| And we're also going to get some, I think, some free advice from the designer for the Tyson Park skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4210)|
| 1:10:20| Wally Holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Wally Holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Yeah, he's going to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| So I think there will be a few lunches or dinners or something as a result of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| but we're very grateful for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| And it's really going to be a nice park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| I think we started out with looking at essentially a tennis court with something similar to maybe what they have down at Concord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4236)|
| 1:10:44| the county's built, which is a nice facility, but I think that in starting to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| we really wanted something that was going to be a big asset to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| And because of the location right along First Creek, this is going to be really a park-like atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| There's a proposal for an upper First Creek Greenway going through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| We see that there's a lot of synergy with that facility, getting a lot of people down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| One of the things that we requested is a bleacher for folks to come down and just watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| You know, these kids are very talented and really feel that this could be a big asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| One of the things that I found out in getting involved in this process is how much time these parents spend taking their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4280)|
| 1:11:28| to skate parks that have been built in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| And this is really big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| And I really appreciate the city of Knoxville for its leadership in building this regional skate park in Tyson Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| and I think the Fountain City Skate Park will be really an excellent satellite park to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| Well, I just want to thank you for your very excellent process and including the young people in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4306)|
| 1:11:54| That's significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| And Mayor, we do have a local celebrity, Brian Bousheen of Pluto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| Would you stand, Brian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| And if anybody needs a skateboard in this auditorium or on TV, go to that man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4323)|
| 1:12:12| Brian, if you could come up to the podium real quick, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4332)|
| 1:12:20| My name is Brian Bousheen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| I live at 230 East Burwell in North Knoxville, not technically in the Fountain City area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| but I do plan to skate at the Fountain City Skate Park as well as the Tyson Skate Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| And I presently skateboard at the Concord Skate Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| But those are all just pieces of the puzzle for the large plan is to have a skate park in the East Knoxville area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4355)|
| 1:12:45| a skate park in the South Knoxville area, and then one also in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| Now, this is something the city and county parks departments have worked together on in a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| and tough process involving a lot of skateboarders, Chris Woodhull, a lot of people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| including police officers, private business owners, radio talk show hosts, and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4384)|
| 1:13:12| We envision the Tyson Skate Park as the centerpiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| It's more than a half-million-dollar beautiful skate park, if you've seen the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| It's going to be an elaborate, beautiful skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| These smaller skate parks are not really expected to bring people from Nashville or Lexington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| to drive all the way here to skate at Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| That skate park is really designed for those local people in that area to get kids off of the sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| and businesses of Broadway at a safe, quality facility designed by local skateboarders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4421)|
| 1:13:49| supported by the local business and parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| What they've got developed there is a great, great plan for their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| It's great to see the Concord Skate Park open right now on North Shore Drive, if you haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| Tyson Skate Park is planned to be open hopefully before Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| I checked on the bulldozers out there this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| Everything seems to be going in order, as Joe Wallace checks on it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| But the plan is for the county to also put in a skate park at Powell, possibly at the Splash Park, developing still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4456)|
| 1:14:24| and eventually one in South Knoxville and East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| These are plans that we've studied from other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| We've been through a two-and-a-half-year planning stage now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| And this is a cohesive city-county plan to really address skateboarding all over Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4476)|
| 1:14:44| And this Fountain City portion is a big part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| And we're real proud to see all the kids working together for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| Thanks, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| And thanks to all of you for coming out and hopefully got a little bit of a civics lesson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| and democracy lesson while you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| But we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4499)|

| 1:19:17| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| Yeah, I wanted to, I'm always concerned about how expensive this has become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| and I wanted to ask Mr. King just about any thoughts about how, if we could start this process over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4763)|
| 1:19:31| how we could avoid the change orders on this, because it feels like this is the second one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| and I know there's some problems with the railroad, but it feels like a fair question to ask for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| What should we have done different, if anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| Actually, on this particular greenway, we've designed this retaining wall three different times through our consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4782)|
| 1:19:53| What could have been done to prevent this would have been to get some of this done on the front end rather than out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| Unfortunately, it wasn't realized that the railroad's degree of involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4799)|
| 1:20:05| because we aren't actually on railroad property, but we are very near it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| and in the railroad's opinion, the excavation of the slope could affect their track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4810)|
| 1:20:17| So that kicked our consultant into a level of review by the railroad that they did not anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4817)|
| 1:20:24| So we designed the wall originally when we bid the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| We redesigned it once, and it didn't pass muster with the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| This time we think we're finally there and we're ready to build this wall and put this project behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4832)|
| 1:20:41| Fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Mr. King, is Norfolk Southern actually signed off on this design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4851)|

| 1:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4855)|

| 1:20:59| Item 11-R is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Advanced Polymer Recycling, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| for the collection and purchase of newspapers from the City of Knoxville Recycling Drop-Off Centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| I'd like to ask Mr. Wetzel if he could please explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| Thank you, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| I'd be happy to say just a few words here on both this one and the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| 11-R and 11-S are recycling contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| I think they're good news stories for the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| so I'm going to kind of put a little bit of a positive spin on them here tonight to let you know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| In the past, we have split our receipts on our recyclables with the vendors that hauled them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| From now, we now own our own boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| We're going to own our own materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| So when we sell this material, all that funding will come to the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| So if we sell the materials, and also I should say this, the paper and the plastics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4908)|
| 1:21:54| and the aluminum recycling market is doing very well right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| And if we can sell the same amount of product as we collected this year at the same prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| that they're selling for currently in this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| we will see a net increase in income from $132,000 possibly going up as high as $380,000 next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4926)|
| 1:22:14| So it could be up to $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Jason Wilmer is our recycling coordinator that's been working to put this deal together for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| He's done a real fine job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| And while we're at it, we have the firm that we'll be working with that's proposed here is Advanced Polymers Recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| They're a some folks that have been working out off Central Avenue and the old Dempster site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| and developed quite a fine recycling facility out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| They're standing here in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| If you guys would just kind of wave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| That's the Bales family, Jason and Edward and Edward, and they put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4958)|
| 1:22:44| There's a first-class recycling facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| And the good news here is, again, there were five companies that bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| There's a lot of competition growing in this field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| And so this is kind of another step forward in the recycling program for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| So I just wanted to share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Since you referred to the next resolution as well, with council's permission, I'll ask a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| And this first one is about newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| The second one is about everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| I happened to stop by the Knoxville Recycling Coalition this week to drop off some old cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| And they take care of getting those to people that might be able to use them for emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| And I asked them if they knew why the county is now accepting plastics one through six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| but the city is only accepting plastics one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| And they said, oh, the city's working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| I hope to have it soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| But our new contract still says only one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| Can you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| By the time we get it to final form, we will be taking one through sevens at APR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| They've confirmed us to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| So we're moving to one to sevens as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| That's what I wanted to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| On recycling, the Wetzels recently recycled a historic home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| which received an MPC Excellence Award for their renovation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| I wanted to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Gorgeous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| I'm glad they didn't throw the old one away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| I just think it's commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| It's a great move and a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| And bringing in some money as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| So it's an all-around great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| We just need to encourage people to recycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| Hopefully we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| The more volume we get now, the more money comes to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| So it is more encouraging neighbors to use our recycling facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| 11-S is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| with Advanced Polymer Recycling Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| for the purchase of recyclable materials from the City of Knoxville Recycling Drop-Off Centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Excuse me, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| Mayor, I'm just sitting here thinking, well, what can we do to help promote this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| I mean, you know, we're saying encourage our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| I mean, are there some things we could do to, you know, some sort of grassroots things to try to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5078)|
| 1:24:46| You know, we have an ongoing recycling education program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| and certainly with the new way we're set up, we need to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| We are continually looking at ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| We send out our annual waste watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| We go to every event and have a booth there at every event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| So we just need to keep the word on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| We recycle roughly 5,000 tons of material a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| We take roughly 55,000 tons of material up to the landfill from the collections at the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| So if we can get people to start separating that out a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| and bringing it to the bins a little bit more, we can reduce disposal costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| and raise our recycling income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| So it's a slow process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Obviously, well, we'll just leave it right there for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5127)|

| 1:31:16| They really could use some new sidewalks to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| And I won't mess with you with no more sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| You can take the rest of that money and put it out there by your house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| We don't have sidewalks or street lights, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| Mr. Mayor, let's see what else I have wrote down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| I wanted to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| And, oh, yeah, KUB, right now, over on Harrison and Louise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| they're putting in sewers, doing some touch-up work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| I hope somebody from KUB is listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| I hope they don't take y'all six months to do the work, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| because we really want those sidewalks in before the mayor spends all that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| You know, because y'all say we allocate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Then when y'all get through getting all the new sidewalks, Mr. P, I won't get none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| I tell you, I'm in line right behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| That's nice to know you behind me this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| And, you know, then I'm going to speak on my pet peeve right quick, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| I heard Pastor Lee come up and speak yesterday, reference county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| I don't like going to county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| but I heard him speak about commission jumping on Cynthia Finch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| and speaking out on Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| I sort of disagree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| It was okay that he did it, and I hope he's listening tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| but I've never seen any black pastor come up here and speak out on black on black crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| Now that this is going on, you know, it made me wonder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| are they only speaking out because they're parishioners in their churches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| You know, if you're going to be fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| we got a whole lot more issues in East Knoxville besides the community service director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5566)|
| 1:32:53| We got a whole lot of crime going on, Councilman Becker, in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| and I haven't heard not one of those pastors that was sitting up there yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| speak out on nothing that really matters to the citizens of some of their congregations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| And I just want them to know that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| And I hope I'm not being too harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| I'm trying to be a little soft with it, but at the same time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| like everybody trying to come to me to defense, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| once you come to, you know, they're trying to make it a black on white issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| and I know it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| I feel it's more or less a black on black issue because those same pastors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| they didn't come up here and speak on Mr. Laquetta Bones' behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| They're not speaking out on Margie Lloyd's behalf, just Sensitive Tensions' behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| If you're going to speak out on somebody, you speak out for all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| and don't speak out for any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| You know, that's just, I don't consider myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| I'm about finished, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| I don't consider myself a community activist because I'd rather be a political activist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| because I know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| They can speak out on whatever they want, but I want them to be fired when they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| And lastly, Mr. Mayor, and I'm out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Y'all can go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| You know, I read in the paper the other day, you know, a lot of people call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| a lot of people see me where I'm going when I'm out, and everybody say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| hey, man, you keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| I don't care what part of town I'm in, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| My voice is larger than a lot of people think, and I know it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| I don't boast about it, but I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| But let me tell you, Mr. Mayor, before you go home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| I called up to the Knoxville News Sentinel because last week in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| I wanted to know who those nine individuals were that went up to the News Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| to talk to Mr. Jack McElroy about publishing stuff that is true in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| Myself and all the citizens of Knox County and the city of Knoxville want to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5684)|
| 1:34:50| And it's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| It's not just a small group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| The whole 400,000 want to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| And the lady gave me the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| You know, and I'm getting a little tired with Leroy Thompson's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| He went up to the News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| David Walker, up to the News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| These are the same dudes that profited from Renee Kessler when she was up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| They're the same guys that profited from Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| So what they're doing, going up to the News Sentinel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| talking to Mr. McElroy, asking him to stop publishing what he's publishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| What they got to hide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| If the News Sentinel can't let us 400,000 people know what's really going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| And I'll finish with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| You know, people out there in TV land, you got to figure the rest of it out for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| Thank you, and we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| Thanks, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070828?start=5740)|
