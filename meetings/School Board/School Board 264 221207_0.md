| 0:00:30| Welcome to the Board of Education's December 7, 2022 regular session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=36)|
| 0:00:56| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=61)|
| 0:01:21| So a reminder to everyone that starting next month our meeting schedule will change slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=81)|
| 0:01:27| Our board work sessions will be held on the first Monday of each month with the exceptions of January and July where they will be pushed back to the second week due to New Year's and July 4th holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=87)|
| 0:01:39| Our regular voting sessions will follow in the same week on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=99)|
| 0:01:45| Meetings will continue to start at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| The board's annual meeting calendar is available on the board's webpage in a printable format if anyone needs it for reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=108)|
| 0:01:56| I also want to remind everyone in attendance that the Board of Education's public meetings are the only opportunity we have to discuss items that come before us as an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=116)|
| 0:02:06| We are very...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Sit back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| But please refrain from applause, cheers, groans, booing, and or conversations with others in the audience as this can be very distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=137)|
| 0:02:26| And it does make it difficult for board members to hear each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| And finally, since we do not currently have another board meeting scheduled until January 9th, I wanted to wish all of our students, families, and staff a wonderful winter break as Knox County Schools will be closed December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=150)|
| 0:02:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| And finally, since we do not currently have another board meeting scheduled until January 9th, I wanted to wish all of our students, families, and staff a wonderful winter break as Knox County Schools will be closed December 22nd through January 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=163)|
| 0:02:59| Board members also want to note the updates to tonight's meeting agenda quickly and then I will entertain other requested changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=179)|
| 0:03:08| Item 5D1 was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| Item 5D13 was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| A second revised version of board policy B140 was emailed to you and is attached to the agenda as version 2 for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=196)|
| 0:03:25| The only change was the addition of language to ensure board members are notified of agenda set meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=205)|
| 0:03:33| A new fiscal note for item 8C was emailed to you and is attached to the agenda for your consideration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| Item 8E was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| And Ms. Horn, you mentioned that you would be requesting that items 8A and 9B be deferred until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Do you still want to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| So are there any requested changes, other requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| So do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Move to approve with those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=249)|

| 0:04:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| Item 5, consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| So a motion by Ms. Horn, a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=272)|

| 0:04:54| So a motion by Ms. Horn, a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=302)|

| 0:05:18| So a motion by Ms. Owen, a second by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Is the motion to approve in the original form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=325)|
| 0:05:34| That's the one we have two attached to the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Mr. Goodworth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| So yes, I mean both forms amend the original policy, but version one has the original amendment, which was discussed Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=341)|
| 0:05:53| and then version two has the original amendment plus the language that was added according to Mr. Watson's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| Just a word about that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| You know, obviously trying to loop in board members with as much notice as possible, but pursuant to the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=362)|
| 0:06:10| the chairs sometimes have, you know, issues as far as, you know, doctor's appointments or what have you, other conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| So, I mean, there could be a time where there might not be 48 hours notice, but, again, we're practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| I mean, that's where the language came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| Or we might have to reschedule for a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| But, I mean, you know, in that case, then you would notify the board members that you're rescheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| That would probably be the more likely scenario based on past experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| So, yes, the board does need to decide if you want version one or version two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| So, we had a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| You missed that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Yes, but I'm making the motion for the purpose of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| I would like to keep this policy as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| I believe we owe the public the ability to see our agenda-setting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=422)|
| 0:07:10| to see any meeting that they can legally be allowed to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| We are there to serve the public, and I don't think we should ever have a meeting where we don't have a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=437)|
| 0:07:28| And I don't think we should ever have a meeting that they could legally attend in which we feel that it is so secret that they shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=448)|
| 0:07:40| I feel like that's inappropriate, and I would like to continue to have this as an open meeting for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=460)|
| 0:07:51| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| Mr. Dufler, I think in version two you addressed the point that you just made in terms of the last line says notice where practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=475)|
| 0:08:04| So, I think that addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| Ms. Owen, I agree with your concern, but I'm also thinking about all the meetings that I've had with the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| and others within central administration where the public probably could attend if they were invited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| but were not needed to attend because they were for the purpose of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| And I've had emails about this today, and I'm sure all of you all have, that address this and address it from a transparency issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=507)|
| 0:08:36| And I think because our agendas are public and they're made public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| and I've had people say there's things that we hear at those meetings that we don't hear in other meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| that to me I see the purpose of that meeting solely for the purpose of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| And I do think there's some particular challenges with doing that as were addressed on Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| So, I'm certainly not a proponent of closed government or shutting doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| but I just see this in a very different light than what our other public meetings are intended to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| If I reset my mic, I'm trying to see who's next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| Ms. Fike, I think it is you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| I have a couple questions kind of for either way that we were to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| If we were to move forward with how this has been amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| is there a way to put some sort of 24-hour notice to the board of changes or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=576)|
| 0:09:45| Because I know a lot of times I have a job and kids outside of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| and if I did want to attend, if it were an hour beforehand, that would make it really difficult for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=589)|
| 0:09:57| And also, if this were to go forward with how it's amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| does that mean that no public could attend if they knew about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| The next question is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| Well, I'll just stick with those for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| Mr. Duport, do you want to answer that last question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| So, I mean, the second amendment has a 48-hour notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| I mean, so you would want 24 if there's a change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| So it has a 48-hour notice to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| and that would be even if it's a last-minute to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| and that would be even if it's a last-minute change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| Or how exactly would that be handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| So if something came up and it had to be moved, I understand last-minute things happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| but what would be the process of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Would we be emailed or text messaged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| I mean, my thought would be or the purpose of the amendment would be that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| the agenda meeting is set, say, a week in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| It could be noticed a week in advance to board members, but at least 24 or, I'm sorry, 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| If there's a last-minute change because the chair can't be there for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| then that would at least be emailed, if not text messaged out to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| hey, we're having to change from 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| as soon as that information is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| And just for reference, let me say that does not happen often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| There has only been one time that because of one of my children's health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=700)|
| 0:11:48| it would have been easier for me to have met earlier or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| I mean, we still met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| I'm just saying, like I said Monday night, I don't have strong feelings about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| But, you know, when you say because the chair can't be here, I just want to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| this is not like a regular occurrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| I mean, this happened one time, so I would not expect that that would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=727)|
| 0:12:17| And then the other question, I believe, was about can the public show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| You know, the public notice would be for the purpose of having a public meeting to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| As Mr. Watson was talking about, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| the school system is entitled to have planning meetings and things like that that are not open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| So who would be invited to this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| It's school staff and the board chair and, of course, the director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| Is this something where that notice would go out to all staff when it's scheduled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| Currently, I mean, and I think Dr. Rosner may be able to elaborate on this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| but currently I believe it's upper staff, executive staff that come to these agenda-setting meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| and then, of course, it has to be the executive committee, which is the board chair and the director of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| And then Ms. Coatney is there because she puts together the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| And then, of course, I'm usually there to help out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=794)|
| 0:13:26| Ms. Selland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| I'd like to point out that this kind of meeting is very different from a meeting where one of us would meet with a staff member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| where one of us would meet with the director of schools, because this would be open to other members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| So even though there would not be discussion, the difference here is that other members of the board could come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| And I would like to remind everyone that the whole reason that this was open to the public to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| is because when a board member went to attend that meeting, they were told no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| to the point that they actually moved the meeting to another location so that board member could not attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| This policy still does not do anything to guarantee that a board member could attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| It says that we would be notified, but there's nothing to stop a future chair from just picking up and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=852)|
| 0:14:22| nope, something's come up, we're not going to meet because there's another board member here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| Ms. Selwin, can I just interrupt just a second to clarify that that has not happened currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| That was before my time on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| No, this was prior to the change, so it was prior to 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| And we've had open meetings since then so that anyone could attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=882)|
| 0:14:50| And I think the open meeting is sort of a guarantee to me that a board member can attend and that that meeting will go on as planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=890)|
| 0:15:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| I'm going to move to Reverend Butler since he's not spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| I have a question of if it was set as an open meeting, that means the public can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=911)|
| 0:15:20| What are the restrictions that if there is an issue that needs to have the meeting changed, that that couldn't be a change that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=920)|
| 0:15:29| Is there a requirement that you can't change the meeting once you set it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| Well, you just have to have the public notice within a certain timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| So if you public noticed it for that time, then you would have to, I guess, start over and schedule, like, how many days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| Forty-eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| So you would have to you couldn't push it back for two hours or one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| You would have to reschedule it 48 hours from that time so you could public notice it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| I mean, you could cancel it, but you would have to public notice the new one and give a 48-hour notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| And what I'm hearing is the reason why we talked about changing it was because of the times that something came up and the change needed to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=964)|
| 0:16:19| Yeah, and I think Ms. Horne had some concerns, too, about I think that was just my perspective on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=979)|
| 0:16:27| I don't think that was the reason Ms. Horne had put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Yeah, thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| So I guess as I'm listening to the conversation, the board places their trust in the chair to represent us as a board on the executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=993)|
| 0:16:45| So that meeting is a meeting for, as Mr. Watson pointed out, the chair and the superintendent to set the agenda for the board's meetings, for the board agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1005)|
| 0:16:58| So it has been the – first of all, I don't remember – I was chair for two years prior to Ms. Christie being chair this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1018)|
| 0:17:07| I don't remember a time, and I may be wrong, but I don't remember a time that a board member wanted to come to the meeting or came to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1027)|
| 0:17:15| So that rarely happens. I'm not sure if you've had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| So that rarely happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Of course, the board members were notified and welcomed to come, but they just don't typically come because I think they – at this point, and I understand that things can be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1041)|
| 0:17:30| but at this point, where we are right now, I think the board has placed trust in the chair and the superintendent, and so that has been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1050)|
| 0:17:39| Also, when I was chair, it was our practice, and I believe from what I've seen – I may not know, but from what I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| that if a board member wants to have an agenda item added to the agenda, that it has been added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| and that as a member of this board, anybody can ask to have an agenda item added, and it's been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| So that has been the case, I think, for the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| So I understand that – and I wasn't on the board – the timeframe that Ms. Owen is referencing was before she and I were on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| so I wasn't on the board then either, and so I don't doubt that that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| But just in the past six years, it hasn't been a problem that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| So therefore, knowing all of that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| I'm sorry to interrupt, but I had just asked a question. I wasn't finished with my point. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| Well, I was just saying that the scheduling for me was not the reason it was put on here, I guess, was my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1114)|
| 0:18:42| Thank you for the clarity for sure, but I did want to make a point of I've heard from folk, the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1122)|
| 0:18:52| who have concerns about this was or is a public meeting now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1132)|
| 0:19:00| and the issue was not voiced by the public that they had concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| I had heard it, both of the reasons I've heard, but the issue I have is that it's not about the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1146)|
| 0:19:14| That's not the issue that I – I don't think the board – I think the board, at least I as a board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| welcome the chair continuing to be the one who sets the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| and we have an opportunity to communicate to her as well as the superintendent prior to that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| and so I don't have a problem with the way that the chair is doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| My concern is this is another open meeting that the public has access to see how we do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| and there's not a reason that I can hear of not having them do that except for that 48-hour requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| that if you move the meeting, you've got to set it out 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| And the other thing that I heard was is that this has not happened a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| I think our chair has said this has only happened one time, so it's not an issue for her to – for it to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1202)|
| 0:20:12| so I think that was the issue that I'm saying if it's not broke, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Mr. Christie, if I may, that was not the primary reason for the recommended change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| The primary reason was that when I was chair, there were several meetings that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| and if media was in attendance, what was discussed at our meeting could be on the news that night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1231)|
| 0:20:40| before board members had the opportunity to know what was on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| because typically when I was chair, we would typically have those meetings on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| They were typically set, as Ms. Christie said in her case, they were typically set a week out at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1250)|
| 0:20:57| We very rarely had to move them, but of course that's a secondary concern as far as convenience for the executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1257)|
| 0:21:04| However, we would have those meetings on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| The agenda wasn't published until Tuesday, usually at 5 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| so there were more than 24 hours that something could be in the media when, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1272)|
| 0:21:23| there may have been something discussed that maybe then was not on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| but it's already in the media like it's going to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| So there could be confusion from the media not understanding maybe something that was discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| but then not on the agenda, or there would be an agenda item that was added that could create some drama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| We had a little bit of trauma a couple years ago for a long while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| and so that could be in the news before board members were aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| So that's the primary reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| I felt that way several times, like I hope this is not in the media before other board members are aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| That was the primary concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| Secondary concern would be the scheduling issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| I think there's a lot of points on all sides, and Mr. Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| I appreciate what you're saying, too, in terms of it's not a fix-it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| I understand the concerns about the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| I know in general it's great for the flow of information to go from that meeting to the board, to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| I mean we even get, I don't know if the public realizes this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| we get notified just a little bit before the public does in terms of what that agenda is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| not because we then influence it real quick in the next 30 minutes or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| It's just kind of like it seems like that's the way you would want the information to flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| And so I appreciate that concern, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| There's one thing I want to point out, and then I've got a question actually for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| So one is that the ability for any board member to add something to an agenda is already part of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| And so the chair really doesn't get to decide if they add it to the agenda or not, from my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| Now, it can be voted off by the board before we ever discuss it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| But if we ask for something, then the chair really is supposed to put it on there according to policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| So I think that's a non-issue in this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| And Mr. Dupler, I want to actually go back to a question that Ms. Byke asked from a different angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| So if we move forward with this and it's a closed meeting or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| but I as a board member, let's say I want to come, and could I bring a guest from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| I know about the meeting. I'm coming to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| Somebody from the public says, hey, I'd like to be at this meeting with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| but I want to ask them to come because I think something's going to come up that I want to get their feedback on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| Could I ask them to come to the meeting as my guest, even though it's not a publicly noticed meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1431)|
| 0:24:00| I don't know. I've never thought of it. I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| So it's interesting. I've never been asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| I'm not kidding you with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| I would say that ultimately this is a meeting of the executive committee, which is the director of schools and the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| So if you're bringing somebody other than school staff or a board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1461)|
| 0:24:30| then I think you would need to check with the chair and the director of schools before bringing a guest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| And if I did that out of a courtesy, they could say, yeah, that sounds fine, or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| And if they said not, could I say, I don't care what you say, I'm going to do it anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| Or I'm not trying to be confrontational, I'm just trying to figure out where the lines are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| because I think that's some of what's in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Well, personally, I'm not going to tell you no if it's up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| And I'm not planning on doing this. I'm just trying to hypothesize what are the implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| and are there unintended consequences from what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| I think that would be a conflict, probably not something I could just answer off the cuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| But I think there could be a concern there, yes, if the committee were to say no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| we don't want that person coming for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| So, yeah, that could be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| Cool. I get how interpersonally it could be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| Like, you know, Dr. Roswick or Ms. Christie might not appreciate that I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| But I think there could be an issue, perhaps legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| Yeah, I understand that's what you're saying, that there may be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| And I certainly understand the other implications of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Ms. Byte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I guess I also want to echo a little bit of what Reverend Butler said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| I had at least a little more than a handful of e-mails today of concerned parents and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| that somehow making this closed would remove some transparency that they feel is already lacking a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1566)|
| 0:26:18| And I wonder if there's anything that would be able to make up for that in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1578)|
| 0:26:28| If it's that closed, is there anything that we could do to bring some transparency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1588)|
| 0:26:36| Would that be you or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| Do you understand what I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| I mean, to me, the issue is not transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| There's just no, there's, it's just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| So, I'm not sure what that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Because if a board member asks for something, like we all go to, or your board members are welcome to go to the policy review meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1613)|
| 0:27:02| And we talk, everybody kind of knows what's going to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Board members are welcome to add agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| Other than that, it's the agenda items are those that are given to us by the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| or brought to the executive committee by the superintendent and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| So, and then the agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| So, I mean, these are not like, it's not like it's a big secret meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| So, I mean, that's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| Yeah, I just, I had enough emails that I'm, it's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| But I don't have the answers and I don't really know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| I've also never been to one of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Just to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Well, and just some additional perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| They're not very exciting meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| I'm just going to tell you, if media's there, it's probably really slow news day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| I mean, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| They aren't very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| Well, and I appreciate that my requests have been honored to be put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| So, I think I received one email about it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| Ms. Sworn, did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Is there a motion on the chair, Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| A motion on the floor, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| I believe Ms. Owen clarified that her motion was for discussion purposes only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| And it was seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| So, I would make a motion that we approve version two of policy B140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| So, we have a motion by Ms. Sworn and a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| And Ms. Coatney, if you will do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Just clarification for what we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| So, make sure I vote the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Yes, I believe the motion on the floor is to approve version two of the revised policy B140,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| which includes the language that board members would be notified of the agenda set meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Mr. Watson, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| Can I say something to my vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Or does it just, I don't know if I can or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Am I able to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Okay, I'm going to say it super fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| So, the thing that I think, for me, that's the issue is, I think it's also what the posture of the district is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| And I just remember myself many times over the last two years speaking to the issue of transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| and the fact that I don't think the school system intends to not be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| But there's also things that we can do and not do that cause us to seem transparent or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| And so, to me, the issue isn't whether or not we're transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| It's what actions do we take as a body that send the flag up to the community that we are trying to be overly transparent or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1828)|
| 0:30:37| And so, again, I get all the reasons why it's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| And I know in the beginning of this conversation, I was very, I was, I'm like, I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| But I think from the posture of what the message that gets sent to the community, I'm going to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1846)|
| 0:30:54| And Ms. Henderson, oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Christie, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| So, that is three yes votes, five no votes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| So, motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| Item 6C, approve first reading of Knox County Board of Education Policy B190,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| media relations as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| Motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Ms. Byte, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Item 6D, approve first reading of Knox County Board of Education Policy B240,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=1896)|

| 0:40:53| So, motion by Ms. Henderson, a second by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Yes, I do have some questions about this and I have received some calls concerning this and emails as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2457)|
| 0:41:08| More of it is just understanding what this committee or team is supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2468)|
| 0:41:23| Also, in light of, I think, at Monday's work meeting, we talked about hiring someone, I think, for like $9,500 to do some work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2483)|
| 0:41:34| So, can you talk about that again, about what this team is supposed to be doing and what the qualifications, what things are you looking for for the team members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2494)|
| 0:41:48| or what their requirements are in terms of how you are required to fill the team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2508)|
| 0:41:56| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| I'll actually defer that to Dr. Wilson so he can kind of explain the overview of that and how these folks were selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2519)|
| 0:42:08| So, first, again, I would root back into what I talked about on Monday night, which begins with our board policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| and that really dictates the membership of the team in terms of who you go out and look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| And the large majority of it, if you look at it, is staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| You know, different departments have to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| There are some seats that are community members and partners and parents, things like that, that you do have to look out of the school staff to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2542)|
| 0:42:33| And so, on Monday night, we did not have Ms. Thompson here with us, who is actually heading up that work, and she has joined us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| So, beyond kind of that level of detail, she's been very engaged in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| I'll let her come up and speak to those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| She can find her way up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2568)|
| 0:43:05| So, the review process, we have received two letters of intent to apply, and so that requires that we put together a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2585)|
| 0:43:15| And as Dr. Wilson indicated, we have a board policy that outlines who needs to be on that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2595)|
| 0:43:23| And so, we were looking, you know, at the various, trying to have a broad range of expertise and interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2603)|
| 0:43:34| Also, looking at the community members that are there, people who could possibly serve, is familiar with the students that they are targeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2614)|
| 0:43:47| And targeting is not a good term, but focusing on serving and having some experience in working with students of high poverty and in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2627)|
| 0:44:01| and trying to make sure that we're representing all of the interest that could be brought out in those applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2641)|
| 0:44:13| So, just trying to make sure that we have a broad perspective so that we can have an accurate review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2653)|
| 0:44:21| There is an application. The application, I believe, was shared with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| There's a rubric that we have to follow, and the reason for bringing in the consultant is that this is a new experience for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2667)|
| 0:44:38| and I want to make sure that we have all the expertise in the room so that we are doing a fair and thorough review of all the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2678)|
| 0:44:49| and take this process very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| This is a significant amount of money that would be allocated for these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2692)|
| 0:45:02| and we want to make sure that we are doing our due diligence in reviewing the application so that we are serving students well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2702)|
| 0:45:12| I take that role very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| All of the students that are currently in charter schools we feel like are being served well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2717)|
| 0:45:25| but that has been a process that we've had to go through over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| We want to make sure that we're doing that for any potential new schools that would come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2729)|
| 0:45:39| So, thank you. If I can just ask, and I'm not sure if this, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| You may have answered my question, but I still have a little confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| particularly in what was asked of me, was I think you have three community members that are selected or that have been recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2749)|
| 0:45:59| and now the staff persons, I think the policy is pretty much clear of who they would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2759)|
| 0:46:09| but the community person is where you have the most leeway of who you would select. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| So, the policy also requires that we have a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| So, the PTA person that we selected, we felt like that would be a good parent representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| because they have dealt with many parents and have connections with many parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| And then we have a person from the Wesley House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| and he has a broad experience in working with students that would be served in either of these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2797)|
| 0:46:47| and also possibly some students that Wesley House serves after school could be students that would be at that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2807)|
| 0:46:58| and so they have an understanding of that targeted audience of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2818)|
| 0:47:06| And then Mike Taylor from Knox Ed Foundation, of course, supports the district from the community perspective in a variety of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2826)|
| 0:47:22| Yes, I guess my biggest thought is this is such an important step in the process for the charter schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2842)|
| 0:47:36| that making sure that we have the team in place, and I also understand that this being new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2856)|
| 0:47:45| and I just haven't been familiar with when you start looking at applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| you need to have someone who has done it before and who knows how to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| and there's a large amount of work that goes in putting this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| and sometimes you need to have someone who's dedicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| So, I'm not questioning the use of a professional, someone who's done it before, coming in and supplementing the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| I just think that the team itself, we need to make sure as a board that we are comfortable that they're going to know how to do what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2890)|
| 0:48:20| So, will the team, particularly the community folks, but possibly the staff as well, will they receive training about what they need to do prior to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2900)|
| 0:48:30| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| We are going to meet the 1st of January, and we go through a training with our consultant, assuming that you approved the contract with her tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2911)|
| 0:48:43| And so, we will meet with her and go through training, and then once the review process begins, then there will be meetings continually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2923)|
| 0:48:54| And I have explained that to each of the people who have agreed to serve on the committee, that it's going to be a heavy lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| Having two applications will be a lot of work for us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| but we're dedicated to putting the work in to make sure that we do a thorough review, not just for the charter application organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2949)|
| 0:49:25| but for Knox County and for our students to make sure that what they're proposing would be something that, in fact, will have our students be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2965)|
| 0:49:36| That's my number one priority, is to make sure that it is a viable option that will allow our students to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2976)|
| 0:49:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| Alright. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd like to suggest that we take a look at policy I-450 at the next policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=2998)|
| 0:50:07| There seems to be a lack of clarity going from page 1 to page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| It says, all responsive proposals will be evaluated by a committee recommended by the Director of Schools and appointed by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3013)|
| 0:50:21| The committee shall consist of individuals from the following KCS departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| We then have a list of nine, but there are 11 on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| It doesn't say there can be only nine, but it seems to be laid out that way, so I think we need to look at clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3031)|
| 0:50:42| For the rest of the board, the list is finance, operations, human resources, research and evaluation, curriculum and instruction, community partner, parent representative, law office, other community representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3042)|
| 0:50:59| Some of those seem pretty clear that there should be one, but others seem less clear, so we might want to look at clarifying that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3059)|
| 0:51:10| Which policy was that again, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| It is I-450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| I-450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| All right. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you, Madam Chair. I think just because we're in this process, it's probably good to look at that policy anyway, because we're about to jump into this and kind of re-look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3082)|
| 0:51:32| Ms. Thompson, I do have a question about – I'm not really concerned about individual specific folks, but I do have a question about Michael Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3092)|
| 0:51:39| So I know Michael's going to – he's the new executive director, hasn't quite started yet in January, right, for KEF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| And I get by position in terms of role that he would be invited, being the head of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| And I know he has a background in East Tennessee and graduated from UT and had time in Oak Ridge and all the things, but he's not been in this area for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3113)|
| 0:52:01| He's been in Richmond, Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| I don't know if in his role there, if he helped with charter review processes in Virginia, but my guess is the laws are probably pretty different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| And so I'm just – I'm curious, was there others that were considered in that spot that has – that knows this particular community better than Michael probably would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3130)|
| 0:52:21| And it's nothing against Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| I mean, I don't know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| I've never met him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| So one of the things that in talking with Ms. Swan, as we discussed who should be considered additionally for those positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3144)|
| 0:52:36| she suggested that someone with a strong knowledge and background of nonprofit should definitely be someone that's on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3156)|
| 0:52:46| And so that was the reason for his selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| In addition to in our – the past committees have traditionally had the CEO of KEF on there because of our relationship with the Knox Ed Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3172)|
| 0:53:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| Ms. Byte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| To kind of piggyback off of Reverend Butler a little bit, so we have two applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| The Chattanooga Prep, which would serve boys of color predominantly is what it seems that they're advertising, middle school and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3200)|
| 0:53:32| And then our other one for K through 5 that advertises serving at-risk students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3212)|
| 0:53:41| And I'm curious if there – who on this list or which many people on this list would specialize in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3221)|
| 0:53:53| to make sure that those schools were actually serving the purpose that they might be advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| So we have Sally Reynolds is a secondary supervisor, and that would certainly be her expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3240)|
| 0:54:09| I've served as the executive director of elementary for the last – and supervisor for the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| I have extensive knowledge in the primary grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| And, of course, others in the department in various roles have dealt with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3261)|
| 0:54:29| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| It just seems that potentially a parent from that community would have been a good choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| I'm losing my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| Well, I will say in talking with Ms. Swan, she wanted us to have the committee to be no more than five or six people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| And so we've already expanded it to twice that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| And so it is going to be a heavy lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| It's going to be a pretty extensive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| And so in the end, we have to come together in consensus and in agreement in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| We will score individually, but we'll come together and make a consensus recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| And so the larger the committee is, the more difficult that becomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| I understand the too many cooks in the kitchen theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| I wonder if this committee will do – and I understand all the expertise, 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| But if there will be any special focus on those areas and if the board will get to hear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| Certainly, we will look carefully at what their recommendations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| We don't have either of the applications yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| So all we have right now is their letter of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| And so we'll certainly look deeply at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| We'll look at any research that's available that they can provide for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| And that will be part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Then in the end, once the applications are reviewed and we bring a recommendation to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| then there will be – it's my understanding that there will be a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| So you will be able to learn about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| So the application process also includes an interview with the people from the school, the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3373)|
| 0:56:22| and the people, the employees that will be –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3382)|
| 0:56:31| Would that be – so, for example, I know Chattanooga Prep is up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| Would it be with their current employees or would it be with the employees that would be for –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| I guess they're going to call it Knox Prep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Yes, it's my understanding it's with the Knox Prep people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Chattanooga Prep already has an approved application in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Ms. Thompson, could we get a list of – could we get the racial makeup of this committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| I think that would be beneficial for the board to be able to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Yes, and thank you for all the information you've given us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| So where is the – is there a location for any of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3441)|
| 0:57:28| You've talked about what they're – what the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| That will come in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| They have not indicated where the schools will be housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3453)|
| 0:57:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| I have spoken with both of the teams, and they've shared with me some possible locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| but I'm hesitant to say that publicly because they've not settled on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Well, let me just cut across the field and say that the current charter school we have is located in District 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3472)|
| 0:58:00| and what I hear a description of what this – one of them want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| that sounds like a District 1 possible location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| So how many people do we have on this team that is from District 1 or work specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3492)|
| 0:58:20| I know where Westley House is, so I know that is located in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| But – and I think that racial makeup is important for us to have, but I like to have that before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3505)|
| 0:58:32| So many times what I find out is people are making plans about what goes on in certain communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| but they're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| They don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| They don't necessarily serve there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| And I'm not taking anything away from all of our fine administrators, teachers, and staff in our schools located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3523)|
| 0:58:50| Obviously they are there, but they don't all live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| So this is going to affect the schools, the students in District 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| as well as all over the county as those who want to travel to those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| So how much of the team is supported or how much will the team be supported by those folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3546)|
| 0:59:16| There are two minorities on the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3556)|
| 0:59:27| And, I mean, we'll certainly reach out to others if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| but the team is going to be the one that does the review and the scoring and make the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3573)|
| 0:59:42| So let me get a little further in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| I think I'm getting towards some soft ground here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| I don't want to get stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| But quite honestly, those two minorities, are they from the communities that these schools might go into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3588)|
| 0:59:56| One is the Westley House director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| Would you assume to count him as someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| Oh, yes. I've had a grandson there as well as having some church members there, so yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| And then Dr. Alicia Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| She's working on her doctorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Alicia Jones is our other minority there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| And their staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Okay, I'm speaking primarily of the community folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| It's the community folk that you have more leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| Staff is there because of the positions that they're in, the positions they're serving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| And, obviously, for the years you've worked and what you've done, you know more about it than I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| You probably forgot more things than I would know about that level of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| But my point is that the community folk, that's where my concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| That's where we have the most leeway is the community folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| And we have to have, obviously, folk who can do the work, but also folk who the community will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| okay, we trust these folk to make some decisions for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3665)|
| 1:01:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Dr. Brewer, I may be able to help a little bit with something, too, just to try to give a perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| So I know what we know of how this process works, like in other counties and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3678)|
| 1:01:26| And just let me be clear on this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| The state has set this up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| This is not, we've got very little leeway in Knox County to do things outside of this rubric that's been created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| that Ms. Thompson has brought in someone to help train our people on how to use the rubric, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3696)|
| 1:01:43| So when this committee is set up, this committee is supposed to be set up to do, in this case, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| We didn't know if there was going to be three, four, or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| So I know we're talking about one and making that assumption, you're probably right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| where that one's aiming to locate wherever it is based on what we've all heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| The other one we have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I mean, it may be in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| It may be in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| I don't know, to tell you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I really didn't learn about it until you guys did when we got the board meeting the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| So I just want to give like a 20,000-foot kind of perspective on the staff side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| Because our job is to try to create a team and then train that team to be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| We won't be saying, boy, this one's great or not or it's good for Knoxville or it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| Like that's not what this committee's job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| This committee's job is to look back against that rubric and be able to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| I'm sure there's financial issues in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| They've got to produce financial documents that they have the backing or that they have, you know, all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| So it won't be as much is it good for Knoxville or not good for Knoxville or those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| So in selection, because I know Ms. Thompson talked to me about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| it was really going who, you know, like I know the parent who's on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| and that's what we had done in the past based on looking back through our records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| was we picked the Knox County PTA president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| And my understanding was that Connie French at that point was that person who was that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| So it was not necessarily trying to pick for different kind of locations or regions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| but really trying to pick an overview of folks that would look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| And to your point, Knox Ed Foundation, I believe, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| when they were Great Schools Partnership, that CEO was on the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| And, you know, this board has used them historically over the years as that community partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| So, again, it wasn't those selections weren't made with any geographic region in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| because we don't know necessarily where they're aiming towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| So I understand what you're saying, but I just want to give that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| And this committee, when they come back, my understanding from hearing the lady from the state board who came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| is it's kind of a they either produced this documentation or they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| It will still be the board's decision whether they want to think it's the right thing for Knox County or not for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| They won't bring a recommendation as far as we think this is good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| They'll say this is what was lacking, this is what they had on their curriculum plan or didn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| this is what they didn't produce on their financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| Like it's that kind of rubric that will come to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| And so their recommendation will be more a they checked the boxes or they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| as far as they won't weigh in on whether we need it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| The state set it up to put that in the hands of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| So I just want to make sure we had that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| I just want to make sure we had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| Dr. Butler, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Yes, and I appreciate what all you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| And I'm not in a mode of disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| I am in a mode of making sure that as I vote for this, I'm voting for the best possible team we can have in place that's going to represent the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3869)|
| 1:04:46| And one of the things I've heard is that I'm real pleased with is that you looked at those people who may have worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| and they will work with low income disenfranchised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| That you looked at those who will work with elementary and middle school and high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| because you look specifically at what the grant, those who are writing applications saying that they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| So if they're going to serve primarily black males, then you ought to have someone, community, a parent from the black male community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3913)|
| 1:05:25| And I'm not sure if the PTA president is from the black male community or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| I don't know who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| It's a female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| I'm not sure where she lives, what district she.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| I'm sorry to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| I didn't ask her where she lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| Yes, and I'll go a step further and say she's elected by the PTA, but all the schools don't participate in that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3949)|
| 1:05:58| So I'm not sure if she was elected by those PTAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| I was the president of PTSO at Austin East, and we didn't participate with the PTA because of just two different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| We worked with them, but we didn't necessarily participate with their elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| And so what I'm saying is that, and if traditionally or historically we used a certain person from a certain organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3972)|
| 1:06:22| it doesn't necessarily mean we have to continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| What I am saying as clear as I can is that we need to put some real thought in this because this is our first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3984)|
| 1:06:32| It may not be our last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| So we need to really think about if we're picking people for specific reasons, let's look at all the reasons we need to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| and making sure that if the applications are, whatever the outcome applications are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| you have people in these communities that they're going to affect more directly than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| I hope I was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| The question that I hear Reverend Butler asking is a question of intentionality that has gone into creating this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4022)|
| 1:07:10| And what I don't hear are answers that sound like intentionality went into creating this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| I hear that it matches our policy, and it matches our policy, and we do it because we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| But I don't hear that there was careful thought and intentionality involved in the makeup of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4046)|
| 1:07:35| as far as looking at the students that these schools are looking to bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4055)|
| 1:07:43| and ensuring that those communities are represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| When we look at something that requires us to have a community representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| I think it's important that that community representative is from the community that we are looking at potentially serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4074)|
| 1:08:04| The other thing I would like to say is, Dr. Reiswick, the answer you gave about the rubric is almost exactly the answer I gave someone a couple of days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4084)|
| 1:08:16| And while I'm sitting here, it's not the answer I would give again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| Because I've seen a rubric used in a classroom, and two people, one used it to score a person as a 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4101)|
| 1:08:31| the other person used it to score the person as a 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| And they were looking at the exact same lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| So a rubric alone isn't something that guarantees fidelity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| The person using the rubric and their ability to interpret what it means and their training in interpreting what it means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4125)|
| 1:09:00| can make a huge difference in how that rubric is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| So perspective does matter, even when you have a rubric, because that rubric isn't making the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4143)|
| 1:09:12| It's the people using the rubric making the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| Dr. Reiswick, I think from the training that we went through a couple weeks ago, or last month, or whenever that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| the thing that stood out to me, and I could be wrong, is what I was hearing, I can't remember her name either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| the lady from the state said, I wish, what was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| Elizabeth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| Elizabeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Elizabeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Dr. Reiswick, it's Elizabeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| It's Elizabeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| What I think I remember Elizabeth saying was, is that really even the school board is not intended to make the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4188)|
| 1:09:56| on whether or not we like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| I mean, it didn't, I don't sound like, it didn't sound like from her description of state law that we actually get that latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| From my understanding, now individual board members can do whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| I can vote no to anything, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| But from my understanding, from the intent of state law, is that it's not even about whether or not I like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| It's whether or not does it meet the standards set out by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| And we're supposed to, in good faith, and again, I know we can, we're supposed to, in good faith, approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| So if the board doesn't have that latitude, I'm agreeing with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| I don't know that this committee has this latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| I would bring a different perspective to what Ms. Owen was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| Ms. Thompson, I think you all had intentionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| To me, it's a different, it's what expectations are you trying to meet in being intentional, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4243)|
| 1:10:49| I think you all were certainly intentional in the choices that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| And I think what I would, I agree with Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| I'm pretty sure this is not going to be the, it's not the first time we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| It's probably not going to be the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| We're going to do this some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| And I think one of the conversations that maybe the board needs to have when we discuss this policy is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| what is our expectations for this team in terms of the makeup of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| Because policy is just guardrails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| We can move beyond policy in terms of setting expectations of what our real desire is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| And to what Ms. Owen said, there's only six of these departments that are required to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4281)|
| 1:11:29| But out of the 11 people that are on there, three, we have two more than what's actually needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| because there's three people from the community and six from departments, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| And I would say the other two are myself and Kathy Dugan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| Right, and it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| So that's not listed in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| Right, and it makes sense for you all to be on there, and I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| And what I'm wondering is, and I know the point isn't to have this discussion right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| but maybe a discussion that we need to have as a board when we discuss this policy is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| should it be more balanced with community and people within the district in terms of on staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| Because we can move beyond the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| We need to meet the minimum requirements, but we can move beyond it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| And then would the expectation also be that those community folks should be representative of the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| that these schools will likely participate in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| Now, you wouldn't have had that information to go on to build this team, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| because the board has never expressed that expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| So I don't fault you or whoever the people were that decided to bring this slate to us at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| I just think we as a board, it would behoove us as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| because this is not going to be the last time we do this, to have this type of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| I don't think it makes sense to, in my mind, I mean, I'm going to vote for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| because I don't think it makes sense to slow this down right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| And from what my understanding is, we have a limited amount of time from the letter of intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| to the time we have to make a decision, which is how many days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| Sixty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Sixty days. So we have 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Like, we've got to get the ball moving because the letter of intent came, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| February the 1st is our deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Right. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| I just would encourage the board that in our policy review discussion on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| that we really discuss what our expectations are for this group in terms of its makeup in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| And that would give Ms. Thompson, that would give you more information to go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| in terms of determining what the makeup of this group is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| And if I may say, that was one of the things I've talked with Dr. Wilson about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| In reviewing that policy, there are several things in there that need to be discussed and adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| And if I were you, the last thing I would want to do is try to get in the head of this board, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| Like, you don't want to be, like, guessing collectively, ooh, what's going to be the sweet slate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| Like, you're just going to work off the policy because that's the expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| And I think we just need to give you more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| In all honesty, this is, we've had this policy for a while because we had one charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4425)|
| 1:13:52| We've not had viable applications for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| And this year we have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| And so I think the reason for the makeup of the board, of the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4439)|
| 1:14:06| was not to try to address individual applications in terms of people serving on that team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| but rather to have people there with a broad perspective and expertise that could look at a variety of applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| Because in all likelihood, we could have five or six or more applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| And so to grow a team to represent all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| When we have two, we have the luxury to maybe be more representative in that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| But if there's a time where we're, like, processing ten of these at one time, you can't effectively do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| Yeah, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| And just for clarity, Ms. Thompson, we do not know where that second charter school, the location they're eyeing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4488)|
| 1:14:55| I mean, it literally could be anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| I mean, was there any indication that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| They gave me two or three different possibilities, but it was not in one particular geographic location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4506)|
| 1:15:16| And that came after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| After she built the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| That came Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| That came Friday, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| I just wanted to point out that we originally approved the Charter Review Committee team back in, I think, February or March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4528)|
| 1:15:37| So because I remember that because I looked it up not long ago during a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| and I pointed out that we needed a new review team, and I asked you that question, and that's why this team was put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| And it wasn't based on any certain community, I don't think, because we would have had, had all the reorganization not happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4547)|
| 1:15:57| we would have had a Charter Review Committee that was approved in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Or whenever we approved it before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| It's my understanding that the team is, there's a new team each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| But we approved the one for this year in February, or is it school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| Because we approved one back several months ago, but it was in this calendar year, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| It would have been for the last review cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| So it would not have been for this review cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| And this, you know, this is eight out of the 11 team members are staff positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| So I appreciate the team that you've put together, and I think that you've done this according to our board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| And I think we may need additional policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| We should have conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| But I appreciate that you've tried to follow board policy and put together the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| Ms. Byte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| I think you kind of answered the question a little bit that I was going to ask in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| So this team is just for the applications that have been submitted for the 2024-2025 school year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4627)|
| 1:17:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| And then it will change each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| I believe that's what has been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| So we can't receive any more applications for this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| For that 24-25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| I really liked what Ms. Owen said about rubrics and how, you know, some things can be still subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4656)|
| 1:17:46| I would really like to see someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| I know the whole cooks in the kitchen thing, but I would really like to see someone who has worked with boys, specifically District 1 and stuff like that, to be on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4669)|
| 1:18:00| But I don't know if that's a possibility now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| But I think that it could make a lot of people feel a lot better about this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4683)|
| 1:18:15| Gina, again, I think the important factor here really, as we think about that, and if there's a decision to try to add members, it does create a time situation that impacts training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4695)|
| 1:18:24| And it will be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Each person on the committee has to sign a conflict of interest form saying that they don't have any connection to either of the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4706)|
| 1:18:42| Terry, have we shared that with the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| Any other addition would have to be able to sign that conflict of interest form as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4726)|
| 1:18:55| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Yes, I'm maybe echoing a question, but is it possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| And once again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| And I don't want to give any impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| I don't appreciate all the work that's gone into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| And really, quite honestly, the community persons and the positions that they hold, I don't have a question about or concern about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4750)|
| 1:19:18| I do have a concern of having a lack of, and that means that would be adding more members and not replacing members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| I think the members on there are quite fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| So is it improving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| And then I also hear that we are in a time crunch, that this needs to be approved, I guess, tonight is what I'm kind of hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4771)|
| 1:19:43| That you have the training starting in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| We have it scheduled for January the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| January the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| That date seems familiar to me for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| Is that the night we meet again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| So is it possible to approve this with adding members to meet, particularly in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4798)|
| 1:20:17| a parent or in the District 1 community where the school may or may not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4817)|
| 1:20:28| And also, and that is a minimum, but also adding someone who, a nonprofit person who has worked specifically with the African American community at that age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4828)|
| 1:20:43| And I'm not sure if that may be met by the Wesley House person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| I'm sorry to say, Mr. Solomon, I believe would meet at Wesley House as a nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| So, and then the other thing I would just add is that I feel like that we have to vote for this tonight so you can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4852)|
| 1:21:04| And if I feel like we have to vote for it to move forward, I really don't feel like I have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| I feel like I have to vote for it in order for the work to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| But if I have to vote for it in order for the work to be done, then do I really have a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4874)|
| 1:21:20| And so I hope that we're not in this position again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Once again, not pointing any fingers and not making pass any blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| I'm just sharing how I feel as a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| Because charter schools have an effect on the district that it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4890)|
| 1:21:38| It draws students from the district that it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| And so I think it's important that we have representation from those, from that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4901)|
| 1:21:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| Ms. Selwyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Can you remind me of the date for the training in January again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| January the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| January 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| So that confuses me regarding the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| And I think some board members are confused about what we have actually received at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| At this point, we should have only received letters of intent, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| So the deadline for submitting charter applications is February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4937)|
| 1:22:23| And the earliest we can accept an application is 15 days prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| So the earliest we can even accept a charter application is January 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| In other words, this training is set to happen a week before we can even know that we absolutely do have an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4955)|
| 1:22:46| We do have letters of intent at this point, but we do not have any applications at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| And we cannot have any applications until January 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| At that point, the February 1st point, that deadline of February 1st is where the 90 days begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4977)|
| 1:23:08| So the review committee will review all applications and submit recommendations to the board in such a manner as to facilitate an action of the board within 90 days of the submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=4988)|
| 1:23:20| So I suppose it could be that January 17th date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| That's where the 90 days begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| It's not 90 days from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| I want to be sure the board understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| Actually, we have 60 days from the day that they make their submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| Our first application was received on November the 10th, so 60 days from that would actually be January the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5016)|
| 1:23:44| We shouldn't have an application yet, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| We can't submit an application unless the law has changed and our policy is not updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5026)|
| 1:23:54| So we only have letters of intent at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| We don't have any applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| But Knox Prep could submit their application on January the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| And it says 90 days in our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| Is that wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| I'd have to research that, but that is what it says in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| In the policy, it does say that once the application is submitted, then it's 90 days after the submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| We do have 90 days to review the application, but they have 60 days from the day that the letter of intent is submitted to submit the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5066)|
| 1:24:38| So they could submit the application on January the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5078)|
| 1:24:49| The policy says they should not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| It has to be 15 days prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| Okay, that is another error in the policy that we need to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| So is that timeline the state regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| I spoke with Serena Bales with the charter commission on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| So it sounds like our policy needs a major overhaul if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5109)|
| 1:25:20| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| So the 60 days is from letter of intent to the time that they can start an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| but we're still trying to figure out if that's completely accurate based upon what our policy is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| So the letter of intent, we have 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| That's giving us notice that it's time for us to get our team trained and ready to accept the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| Right, and so that's my point of clarification is within that 60-day window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5142)|
| 1:25:49| then is it expected and needed and required for us to have the team selected and trained by the 9th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5149)|
| 1:25:58| Or could the team be finalized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| And I know this isn't ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| I get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| I'm just asking what the possibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| Could the team be finalized at the January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| Does that give time to do training, and does it fit the regulations to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5169)|
| 1:26:16| And, again, I'm not necessarily asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| It's just dependent if Knox Prep submits their application early, before February 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| their 90-day review time starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| So the challenge then is if we don't have this team selected and they're not trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| and we get their application, let's say, January 9th, we can't accept it at that point and we get it then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5190)|
| 1:26:36| then that clock starts regardless of what we've done related to the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| And so we would lose time from actually evaluating the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| because we're also trying to select a team and get it up to speed and trained during that 90-day window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| when ideally we're just reviewing the application in that 90-day window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| not selecting the team and training them in that 90-day window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| And I would say we have the 90-day review time, but it's not actually going to be 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| because the board has to have approved the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| or not approved that application within that 90-day frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| So in order to meet the deadline for, you know, the agenda deadline and have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| not calling a special called meeting but actually making it hit one of our meetings that is already on the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| Right, trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| We actually only have about 75 days if we're trying to follow the normal timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5241)|
| 1:27:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| And then a follow-up question based on Reverend Butler's question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| and I don't know what the possibility of this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| could this slate be approved with an open slate to be filled by a parent from District 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| And then the other question, and I don't know that you know this, Ms. Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| but I know Aaron is a person of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| He works in District 1 at Wesley House, but we don't know if he lives in District 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5266)|
| 1:27:51| and do we know if he's a parent in District 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| I didn't know if you would, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| I'll just add in regards to that timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| just an assumption I'm going to make is that Chattanooga PREP is probably going to be pretty well equipped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5287)|
| 1:28:16| to come with an application because they already have a charter in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| So they're probably going to be well organized, I would assume, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| And I think it would be beneficial to us to be as organized as we can and prepared when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5308)|
| 1:28:37| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5317)|
| 1:28:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| It appears that maybe we accepted letters of intent too early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5328)|
| 1:28:55| Mr. Dupler, I'm looking at 49-13-107, and I also was looking at 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5335)|
| 1:29:02| 108 is specific to 60 days regarding appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| But in 49-13-107, it says 60 days before the application process begins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5348)|
| 1:29:15| a prospective charter school sponsor shall submit a letter of intent to the Department of Education and the authorizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5355)|
| 1:29:22| So it looks like the timeline doesn't begin because of the letter submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5362)|
| 1:29:29| The timeline is backwards from the time of the application deadlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5369)|
| 1:29:45| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| I'm looking at the state approved form for the letter of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| It looks like it had to be submitted by December 3, according to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| I do agree with what you're saying, that 60 days before the application process begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| But I would say that the states likely figured out that December 3 was 60 days before February 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5405)|
| 1:30:15| and that it had to be submitted by that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| But I see what you're saying in 49-13-107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| It does talk about the February 1 deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| And then you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| 108 then talks about the 90 days from the submission of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| So any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| So we have a motion by Ms. Henderson and a second by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5449)|
| 1:30:58| Do we need a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| Let's just do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| Mr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| Is it possible to ask for a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5473)|
| 1:31:23| Mr. Duport, we have to vote on this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5483)|
| 1:31:34| I mean, you've called for the vote at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| Ms. Owen, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| That is six yes votes, two no votes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5533)|
| 1:32:20| Item 9E, discussion and possible action regarding the maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| renovation, and installation of existing and new playgrounds at Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5544)|
| 1:32:35| So a motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Ms. Owen for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5555)|
| 1:32:48| We don't have an action, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| Correct, and with a second, that opens discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| I appreciate the presentation and all the information that we've been able to gather as a district and a school board from the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5582)|
| 1:33:10| and appreciate the robust conversation from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| I felt like I was hearing some themes in the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| and I reached out actually to some of our potential partners for a project like this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| talked to some local philanthropists, and also had some conversation with other potential public groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5604)|
| 1:33:33| and I do think there's some interest to possibly coming to the table to have a discussion about maybe some partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5613)|
| 1:33:41| to help take care of an initial lift of about $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| I will say that the philanthropists that I talked to who have been involved in this type of work with Knox County schools in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| did say that they would want to have some buy-in from the school system in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| I also sensed a little bit of, yes, we want to be at the table, but we want to make sure that Knox County schools is at the table too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5639)|
| 1:34:09| I don't have a specific recommendation tonight in terms of action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| because mainly I'd love to hear more from the board now that we've had this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| and you all have had some time to chew on it to see kind of what your thoughts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| Is this something that you think is important in your communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| Are there some ways that you think we can get at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| And to me, there's kind of three components of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| One is that initial lift of $4.5 or so million, which would take care of the two new schools that we built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| that don't currently have playgrounds, also get all of our schools up to par.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| And from my understanding, there was also money in there to build a playground at the new Northwest Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| which there's not currently money for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| So to me, kind of one component of this is, what do we do with new schools in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| Is this something we put into the capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| And then the other is, how do we get the schools that we currently have, playgrounds, up to par?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| And then the third kind of component of this to me is ongoing maintenance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| I'd love to hear if there's any thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| What thoughts you all have as other board members representing your communities on any of those three areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| or how we might get at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| In our discussion Monday, it sounded to me like everyone in the room agreed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| playgrounds are important to the well-being of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| that playgrounds are important to children learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| that playgrounds are a necessary part of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| Everybody that spoke said something in that realm, that this is something that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5739)|
| 1:35:47| And when we look at the individual cost at $300,000 roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| it's the same cost I see as being affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| So if we were looking at the well-being of our students requires that each of our elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5758)|
| 1:36:05| would have one more portable, I don't think we would be having the same discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| I think if we were looking at the necessity of this kind of building for that amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5770)|
| 1:36:21| we would say, well, if that's necessary for the well-being of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| and we have the money available, why aren't we doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| However, when we look at the same thing, something that we all agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| and it's a playground, I think the word play throws us off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5795)|
| 1:36:44| because it allows us to forget the necessity of that for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5804)|
| 1:36:51| And I don't want us to not fund something because we're not really, really deeply understanding the necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5811)|
| 1:37:06| Play is how children learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| Play is how children learn to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| Play is how children learn to get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| Not providing that opportunity in every way we possibly can is really counter to what we should be doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5836)|
| 1:37:30| I think if we were talking about this as anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| if we were looking at this as this much money for textbooks, we'd all be saying, well, where can we take it from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| We wouldn't be going out and saying, who else can we get to pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| You know, we say that this is something we value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| but then when it comes to actually valuing it, I don't see us doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5870)|
| 1:37:57| And that's concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| And I think there are other areas that we could also look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| but I think that's something we need to be really aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| is that when we say this is something that we value and when we recognize that this is what is best for children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| are we actually acting on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| So is it something that we do believe deeply enough to act on, or is it just something that we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5897)|
| 1:38:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| I'll just add some of my thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| You know, of course, South Knoxville is pretty good on playgrounds right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| I don't think we have one on the third tier list, not because we have wealthy schools in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5920)|
| 1:38:47| I can assure you that's not how that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| Actually, it's kind of the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| We have a lot of schools that don't qualify for Title I, but they're not really wealthy either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| which kind of puts you at one of those special disadvantages because you don't have the extra funding or the parental support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5937)|
| 1:39:06| But I will say this, if we're going to put money out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| we have secondary schools that their theater and chorus departments need lighting, sound systems, curtains for their stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5952)|
| 1:39:24| We need band instruments, band uniforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| Do our art programs all have good supplies and equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5968)|
| 1:39:34| South Knoxville has a school that was built in 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| It's a temporary school after a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| The kids are still in that temporary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| You know, this is almost five decades later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| We have portables without restroom facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| I mean, if we're going to dip into this money, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| I don't know that I want to say across the board this should all go to playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=5996)|
| 1:40:03| I mean, that's just my personal opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6003)|
| 1:40:10| Ms. Spike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| The age my kids are, they were very interested in construction equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| so we essentially watched North Shore Elementary get built, and they loved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| And I remember seeing it finished and seeing there not being playground equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| and thinking, well, that's odd that you would build an elementary school without a playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| And I think something that I would at minimum like to see is that when we are building new schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| that that is a part of the entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| It's not just left to the community, though I know we are not necessarily building new schools in certain districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6049)|
| 1:40:57| But I think that that would be important to make sure that that's a part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| and that that money is already kind of a part of the process of that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| And I know there are a whole lot of things that are really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| but I think at minimum we can figure out how to make sure that these families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6071)|
| 1:41:18| and students know that play is important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| There are so many studies that show that is where children work out their emotions and their trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| and also some of their mathematics and adding and one-step and two-step and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| So I think that this is really important, and I think that I really want this conversation to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| so that we can have something in place, because I think we all agree that this is something that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6100)|
| 1:41:49| Ms. Sanderson, did we have a public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| Yes, we actually have a public forum speaker on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| Ms. Jenny Council, if you want to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| You have three minutes, and just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| Hi, I'm Jenny Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| I would like to express my support of Mr. Watson's proposal for KCS to support the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| replacing and maintaining of play spaces across our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| I come to you as a mom of four KCS students at Bearden High School, West Valley, and Bluegrass Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| I currently serve on the PTO boards at all three schools, and I'm a former PTO president at Bluegrass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| Besides my roles as a mom and an active community and school volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6144)|
| 1:42:28| I spent nine years working for Kaboom, a national nonprofit that works to end play space inequity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| My job allowed me to travel to 43 states and five Canadian provinces to come alongside communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| to lead them through the playground design and build process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| I like to think I am a playground expert, but really the experts are the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| The discussion that you are having today is not if play is important, but who should pay for the play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| I do, however, want to share a few points of research that correlate play and a child's academic success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| The growing body of research linking kids' active play with education outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| points to ways that play spaces give a strong boost to youth academic achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| for example, academic performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| A systematic review of 20 studies examining the link of play and literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| concluded that play improves literacy by providing settings that promote literacy activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| skills, and strategies serving as a language experience that can build connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6196)|

| 1:43:27| Secondly, educational behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| The American Academy of Pediatrics has reported that in an academic environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6209)|
| 1:43:33| play helps children adjust to the school setting, thereby fostering school engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| and enhancing children's learning readiness, learning behaviors, and problem-solving skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| Again, I believe that we all agree that play is important to the academic, social, and emotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| and physical development of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| Dr. Reiswick has four goals for the school system, and access to safe play spaces to play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| can support two of these goals, excellence in foundational skills and success for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| The playground is where children learn to communicate, socialize, negotiate, problem-solve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| think critically, and so many more foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| As a member of the Bluegrass Elementary PTO board for the last eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| we have replaced two aging and unsafe playgrounds at a cost of over $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| It is a heavy lift to raise this amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| We are blessed to live in a community that has the resources to raise the money in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| but many of our schools in this county cannot do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| The situation becomes more dire in low-income communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| where children too often lack access to safe places to play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| and societal problems like obesity and toxic stress are more deeply entrenched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| Putting the onus of funding a playground on the school community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| creates a divide where there doesn't have to be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| Funding for play spaces would benefit every single student in every single elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| Every child can play. Every child needs to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| Play does not discriminate. Play is a child's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| Mr. Rogers said famously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| play is often talked about as a relief from serious learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| but for children, play is serious learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| I ask that you get serious about funding play spaces at all of our elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| Thank you. And I tell you, that is some good timing right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| That was good, my friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| That was impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| And I think that, I think she said it well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| I think we definitely all agree that play is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| And I wish our kids had time to do more of it at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| but so who should pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| That's definitely the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| And when I look at one of my elementary schools is on the priority one list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6334)|
| 1:45:40| so, you know, I have a school, I have two elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| One's good and one's on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| So my concern would be really going back to what Ms. Christie said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6346)|
| 1:45:55| There are so many priorities, and that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| There are so many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| So I am not opposed to looking at playground funding, and I think we should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| but I think we need to make sure we're doing it comprehensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| And Dr. Reiser and I have had a lot of conversation lately about which projects need to be priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6368)|
| 1:46:18| And I know, and anyway, he and I have had a lot of conversation on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| and that we need to make sure that we understand that clearly in making these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| So I'm not opposed to dollars in our budget for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6387)|
| 1:46:34| but I think we need to look at it collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| So that's kind of where I'm coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| and I appreciate, Mr. Watson, the legwork you did on reaching out to some of the community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6398)|
| 1:46:45| And one note that I had made also was back to what Ms. Bikes said about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| I think that one thing we could do relatively soon would be for this board to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6410)|
| 1:46:57| and decide to add a playground into our new build plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6417)|
| 1:47:03| And I said the other night, I don't want to pay for playgrounds with capital expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| However, why not just throw in another $300,000 in a $20 million project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| That kind of, to me, is different than funding upgrades on all our playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6433)|
| 1:47:19| So that would be my caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| I would say in that case, I think it makes sense to go ahead and add into the new build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| and put that in the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| I just want to say I completely agree with Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| I was going to say all the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| And I wanted to also thank Mrs. Council for coming and speaking because it really does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| you know, in my mind, this is also an equity issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| This is a clear equity issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| You know, when I was PTO president at Hardin Valley Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| we were blessed to have the funds to replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| We have three playgrounds there because the school is so large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| So we replaced three playgrounds over the course of two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| and we were blessed to be able to raise those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| I had the time to work with the KCS staff to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| But we do have schools that fall in the cracks, that don't really qualify for a lot of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| So you do have those middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| So I would love to see a comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| I know we can't do all of them, but I agree with Ms. Horn in coming up with a comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| and also putting those into the new schools because that puts a big burden on those schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| that don't even have a PTO or a parent support organization built up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6507)|
| 1:48:34| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| Ms. Horn, just a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| I think that, at a minimum, we should shoot to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| And we know that we have a school on slate that we haven't even built yet that we could do that and make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6522)|
| 1:48:48| What are your thoughts about the two schools that have been recently built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| So you have Lonsdale and you have Adrian Burnett who, you know, they're built for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| I know we just approved another item in terms of some reconciliation for Lonsdale tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| But would your thought also be retroactively going back and taking care of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| Because they're in that situation right now where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| they've got schools and kids coming to them with no playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| And, Ms. Henderson, to your point and to Ms. Horn's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| think about the amount of discussion we just had about zoning, right, around that Northwest Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6557)|
| 1:49:23| Many of the parents who just got rezoned didn't even want to go to the new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| And now we're telling you, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| And you're going to go to a new school without a playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| So you don't want to be at that school, and you're going to have to raise the money to put a playground there anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| So to me, like, that's like the minimum we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| But I'm curious of your thoughts on those other two schools that have just recently been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| Yeah, I agree that that would be the minimum to go ahead and do add to that school, the Northwest school that's being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| And then I think we could consider the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| I don't know what the current condition is of either of those playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| Well, they don't exist. That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| Well, they had playgrounds before, I would assume, because they-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| Did they not? I thought they were, from my understanding, they were on the list because there's no playgrounds there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| Am I wrong in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| Adrienne Burnett would have had a playground. It's been there for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| They both did have playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| And when we first discussed this, the very first time that Commissioner Jay came and talked with us, I asked for some clarification from Mr. Oaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6617)|
| 1:50:26| because I knew the situation that had gone on with NSKIPP's renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| And the procedure had always been that during construction, if Knox County Schools did something to destroy the playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6633)|
| 1:50:45| for example, we built the new wing on the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| So if we destroy the playground, then we replace the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| So I don't understand why Lonsdale and Adrienne Burnett don't have a playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| because clearly they had a playground, and now they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| So we should have replaced their playground, and I don't understand why that wasn't part of that bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6663)|
| 1:51:08| And I could be incorrect. I've not been on those sites, so I'd like-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| Yeah, because that would be my assumption. They had a playground before, so why would they not have a playground now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| Dr. Adams, what's the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| We currently do not have playgrounds on those sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| Okay. I thought that was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| And so here we are as a board, and some of us thinking, oh, yeah, they've got playgrounds, right, but they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| So they had playgrounds before, but they don't now because of construction, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| Because of the construction, they don't have a playground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| It is my understanding that there are no plans for a playground to be built on the new schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| Okay. Thank you. So, I mean, that's-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| There are no plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| So I would have assumed that we had playgrounds there, because I would have assumed that we had them there prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| Dr. Ryslick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| Sorry, just to add a little bit. I do think, because we kind of historically-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| Lonsdale does have a playground, just not accessible based on the construction that has taken place, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6728)|
| 1:52:14| So I think you're right, Ms. Owen, on both of the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| I think both were disrupted due to the new construction, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| Agent Burnett as well. The new wing is kind of- I mean, the new building is right on top of that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| So I do think there were existing, and then the construction has either made them inaccessible or they don't exist at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6746)|
| 1:52:34| So the community built playgrounds, we destroyed their playgrounds, and now they have no playgrounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| As far as how- I mean, as far as the background of how they got there, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| I'd have to look into the history of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| But my understanding is, yes, Lonsdale has one that's not accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6767)|
| 1:52:51| and Agent Burnett, I believe, was- what was there was removed for the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6771)|
| 1:52:56| So do we know why we didn't do what we normally do and replace those playgrounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| I could find the answer to that. I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6782)|
| 1:53:14| All right, so any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| So, Mr. Watson, so as far as action- so there was a motion to bring it to a discussion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6798)|
| 1:53:28| So is this something that you're going to bring back in January, or is this something that you were-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| My intent tonight is not to bring any action, but I personally plan on continuing to work on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| And if anybody else wants to provide feedback into that, I'd love for this to be a collaborative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| and do hope to bring some type of proposal with the help of the administration and others at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| Perfect, sounds good. All right, Ms. Cutney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| Item 9F, discussion and possible action on resolutions supporting students and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| by requesting the Tennessee General Assembly amends Tennessee Code Annotated Section 49.6.31.15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6842)|
| 1:54:10| to allow school districts to make retention decisions for 3rd and 4th grade students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6850)|
| 1:54:18| So do we have a motion? Is there a motion by Ms. Owen, a second by Mr. Watson, Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6858)|
| 1:54:25| And we do have public forum speakers, right, Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| Yes, yes, Madam Chair. We have two public forum speakers on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| Mr. Buss, I know I saw you somewhere. Oh, there you are, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| Actually, I wasn't going to speak on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| Oh, I have you down for two. Oh, okay, well...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| It was something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Oh, okay, we'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| That was a minor part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Gotcha, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| I encourage you guys to go get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| Debbie, and I may betray your last name, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Ms. Debbie Beyblade, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| State your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| Okay, my name is Debbie Beyblade. I'm a former Knox County teacher, retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6907)|
| 1:55:13| and I'm also currently a substitute teacher, certified substitute teacher for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6913)|
| 1:55:21| and I am also a member of Justice Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| and I am here today just to implore you to go ahead and pass this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6924)|
| 1:55:34| so that the decisions made about students' retention will involve a multitude of factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6934)|
| 1:55:45| instead of just one factor, because the way it is currently, it is discriminatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6945)|
| 1:55:55| because there's children because of the communities in which they're raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6955)|
| 1:55:59| their income level, bilingual, many, many, many children being raised by grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6959)|
| 1:56:07| and many children being raised by children that are not able to help the students at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6967)|
| 1:56:17| and I feel like this is very, very important, and from my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6977)|
| 1:56:24| by the time they get to third and fourth grade, it's too late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6984)|
| 1:56:28| and that the emphasis as you go forward, if you pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| the emphasis really, really needs to be early childhood detection, pre-K, K, even K transitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=6993)|
| 1:56:45| Programs of that are more effective than trying to play catch-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7005)|
| 1:56:52| I mean, I have taught schools, I mean, students who in kindergarten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| you test them for their colors, point to yellow, what color is that? Banana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7017)|
| 1:57:03| You point to red, what color is that? Apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| And you point to a trash can, what do you call that? Throwaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7027)|
| 1:57:14| I mean, because that's what they hear, and that's the environment in which they were coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7034)|
| 1:57:20| So I just really urge you to go ahead and vote for this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| so that many factors can be involved in the decision of retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| and the fact that it's just at that grade level, it's not really very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7050)|
| 1:57:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| Thank you. Madam Chair, that's it for public speakers on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Mr. Dubler, have you had a chance to review the revised version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7069)|
| 1:57:56| Yes, I reviewed what Ms. Owen put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| and she added the language that I heard was requested on Monday night from Dr. Norton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7080)|
| 1:58:10| Do you see any issues with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| I mean, there's no issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| So I just reviewed these issues for form, and it is legally correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7097)|
| 1:58:23| I reviewed the citation that is in there from the Tennessee State Board policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| and that is a correct rendition of that Tennessee State Board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7108)|
| 1:58:34| And, Dr. Norton, I think you have reviewed this and can check off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7114)|
| 1:58:44| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Again, Dr. Norton, thank you for giving us these seven points that were added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| and I'm in favor of submitting it in this way with this level of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7131)|
| 1:59:00| I just want to also make sure that the public understands that even if we approve this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| that the decision does not weigh in our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| It's the legislature, so you need to contact your legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| I've gotten some e-mails that don't seem to understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| so I just wanted to make that point that we passed this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| This is our opinion, and we, as a board, if we pass this, we can advocate for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| However, the decision makers are legislators, so be sure to contact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| Do we have to do anything about the first one, or can I just go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7176)|
| 1:59:45| So, Ms. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| My intent of my second, I did the second, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| Did I make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7191)|
| 1:59:54| However it went was the version we have here, so the second version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| So I don't know if you, I mean, make whatever motion you want, but my intent was to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| Okay, I didn't know if you were just opening it for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| No, and actually, I don't know if you heard me mumble, I was like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| oh my gosh, I'm intended for you to be able to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| I just jumped the gun, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| Yes, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| Then I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7220)|
| 2:00:26| You have to withdraw your second, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| Okay, so the motion and the second have been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| And thank you for everyone that's been a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| I want to make a motion to approve the final revised version of the third grade retention resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| as amended and attached to the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| So we have a motion by Ms. Spike, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| Okay, so we have one public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| Mr. Buss, you're up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| You know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7271)|
| 2:01:15| My name is Tim Buss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| I've been a resident of Knox County for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| And first of all, I'd like to thank you guys for approving the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| I spoke about it at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| I have a six-year-old who very well could be affected by this law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| and thank you for reminding us to contact the legislature, the actual people who can control this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| But, you know, having so many school boards, you know, weigh in, you know, against this law is also very valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7296)|
| 2:01:45| So thanks, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| I did – this is a little bit of old business, but it's been preempted a couple times by Hot Topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7307)|
| 2:01:53| But I want to talk about the decision to remove the student – the disciplinary by student group data from the superintendent's evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7313)|
| 2:02:03| I really don't understand the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| I mean, I heard some reasoning, and I think, you know, my confusion is shared by a lot of members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7325)|
| 2:02:13| You know, disciplinary disparities have been documented going back six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| and let's face it, they've probably been going on longer than that, but we have the data going back six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| And then even since then, we've found that there have been academic disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| So, you know, student achievement and safety, like what's more important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7348)|
| 2:02:32| I think I stated that in another way before, but it's kind of a rhetorical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| But, you know, quantifying goals and objectives, using data to evaluate performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7357)|
| 2:02:43| and making sure that the organization and the stakeholders know what's important, that is management 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7363)|
| 2:02:52| And, you know, I guess that's where my confusion comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| And, you know, to give a little bit of time to what I perceived as the objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7375)|
| 2:03:03| the only reason that I could kind of discern was that there was worry that educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7383)|
| 2:03:11| and administrators would feel pressured to maybe do things that were less harsh, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7391)|
| 2:03:19| or maybe, you know, put their fingers on the scales in certain situations in order to achieve numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7399)|
| 2:03:27| So I noticed no one objected to the academic data by student group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| And, you know, teachers have a lot of latitude there, too, to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| I mean, there are tests, right, that keep things kind of in bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7416)|
| 2:03:39| But, you know, there's a disparity there that I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7419)|
| 2:03:45| So I would say, you know, members of an organization know that numbers are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7425)|
| 2:03:51| If you've grown up in the United States in the last 100 years, you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| You don't have to be told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| The best leaders help their organizations to find the right behaviors to achieve the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7436)|
| 2:04:02| Mediocre or poor leaders just expect the results, and they don't care how they're achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| Or even worse, they may let it be known that they don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| And however they get it, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| So I hope that Dr. Reiswick and his team end up to be one of the better or the best leaders in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7453)|
| 2:04:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| Thank you, Mr. Bess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| So meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221207?start=7470)|
