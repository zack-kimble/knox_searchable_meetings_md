| 0:03:10| For the Mayor's report, so this is the first meeting of the new year since Council wisely and thankfully decided not to meet two weeks ago on January 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=190)|
| 0:03:20| so I hope everyone had a great holiday and are off to a great new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| I want to remind you about the city schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| We do have a long holiday weekend, a very special weekend, the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=206)|
| 0:03:34| And in terms of the city schedule, our offices will be closed on Monday, January 21st in observance of Dr. King's birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=214)|
| 0:03:42| The Knoxville Area Transit, CAT, on Monday will be operating on the normal Saturday schedule for the buses and the trolleys, so the Saturday schedule on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=222)|
| 0:03:54| Waste Connection crews will be collecting residential garbage and recyclables on the normal schedule, so if you normally put it out on Monday, put it out because they will pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=234)|
| 0:04:04| Complete details about city services and hours of operations are available on our website at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| As always, the local Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Commemorative Commission has planned an inspiring week of events to honor Dr. King's legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=253)|
| 0:04:23| Please visit MLKKnoxville.com for the complete lineup of festivities and activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=263)|
| 0:04:32| The commemoration kicks off at noon tomorrow, Wednesday, January 16th, with the annual Interfaith Prayer Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=272)|
| 0:04:40| This is a gathering of faith leaders from all denominations, and the site moves from church to church each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| so this year we'll gather and worship at Church Street United Methodist at 900 Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| Over six days, the community will share many rich experiences and have opportunities to reflect and renew our commitment to fulfilling Dr. King's vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=292)|
| 0:05:01| Just a few of those events are the Leadership Awards Luncheon on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| There's a new location this year. It will be at Rothschild Catering Center on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| On Sunday evening will be the Night with the Arts at the Tennessee Theater with the Symphony Chamber Orchestra and Carpetbag Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=313)|
| 0:05:21| And on Monday is the Memorial Parade from Chelhowee Park down Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| and that goes down to the Overcoming Believers Church, which is where the memorial service will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=328)|
| 0:05:36| So those are just a few of the King Week highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| So again, you can go online at MLKKnoxville.com to learn about all the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| That's the end of my report. Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| Thank you very much, Mayor. Excuse me. I want to talk just a moment with my colleagues regarding RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=349)|
| 0:05:57| not the content of RECODE, but the schedule that has been suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| As we all know, RECODE has been voted on by the Planning Commission, and Mr. Johnson, Will Johnson at my direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=363)|
| 0:06:11| has sent out a suggested schedule to begin the workshops aimed toward a final vote sometime in late February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| Gerald Green, the Planning Commission Executive Director, sent out a copy this morning of the community outreach that has occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| and you'll see that's fairly extensive, and I'm sure we all got a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=386)|
| 0:06:33| We will receive additional addendum to that draft that was passed sometime this week, I'm told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| Is that right? Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| If Council is prepared to move forward with the suggested schedule, this conversation will end right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| But it's also been suggested to me that we establish a window of time to complete and enact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=410)|
| 0:06:58| and that's the important part, and enact the proposed RECODE situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=418)|
| 0:07:05| This could be a period of, say, up to 60 days, which would put us to mid-March, which would set the act on RECODE proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=425)|
| 0:07:15| perhaps voting on it either on March the 13th, the 18th, or the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| Those would be in a special called meeting, and there would just be one special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| which I assume then we would consider that item on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, and that's why I'm bringing it up right now on what we can establish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| either establish a window or continue with the proposal that's before you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| Keep in mind we also have, Council does, that is, a retreat scheduled for February the 23rd, which is a Saturday, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=465)|
| 0:07:54| And if we change the schedule for the RECODE, then I would propose that we reschedule our retreat for later, probably late March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=474)|
| 0:08:03| So that's the end of my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| I will now defer to any Council members that might want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| If I could, March 19th is the only day the main assembly room is actually available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| The 13th and the 18th, it's taken an evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Thank you, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Councilman Roberto, did you have yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| You know, Vice Mayor, I think having a little bit of a pause, giving folks a time to review, I think is a good measure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=506)|
| 0:08:38| The originally suggested dates that you had provided were January 23rd, which is next week, the 28th and the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| MPC just forwarded the RECODE, you know, to us basically five days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| So I think I'm not comfortable moving that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| I think it's really critical that we have time to examine this and speak with our constituents and come to the workshops, you know, really ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=535)|
| 0:09:06| I agree with what you were saying about trying to set a window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| I'm certainly not suggesting that we slow down to try to not have a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| I think we should vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| There's been a lot of effort put into this, and there's been a lot of public meetings, so I hope that would be understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=557)|
| 0:09:24| But I would suggest that we do, like you said, and look at, you know, maybe having a two- to three-week pause before we start the workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=564)|
| 0:09:35| One thing also to keep in mind is that the design center is having their review on February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| So my initial thought was to look at February 5th, February 19th, and February 28th or March 5th, depending on what schedules look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=581)|
| 0:09:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Those dates are noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| And is there a comfort with March 19th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| I'm not even sure the mayor's available then, because I would ask you to call a special meeting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| One thing I just noticed in looking at March 19th, that is the week of the Knox County schools and the university spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=613)|
| 0:10:21| So there may be – I don't know if that will have an impact on folks, according to my calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| We will work on that date, but that would be difficult, I think, during the week of the spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=628)|
| 0:10:37| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| I definitely support some type of window, a 60-day window to workshops and pushing it on in and getting it off of spring break week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=641)|
| 0:10:53| My biggest concern with recode, most of the things that I have concerns about, I think we will address in amendments at the special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=653)|
| 0:11:05| and we can deal with that, and we'll vote those up or down, in or out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| My biggest concern is notification to property owners that their property is being down zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| And this is something that I've talked about for months and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| It's yet to make the draft, and so these are situations where the map is showing properties that were at one time in the 60s and the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=680)|
| 0:11:34| large areas were at that time up zoned to, let's say, R2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| And now we're deeming it that it's inappropriate to be R2, and we're down zoning those to the R1, to the single family zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=701)|
| 0:11:52| The impact that it would have on the property values of those owners could be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| And mainly these would be vacant properties and probably even larger tracts of properties, not just a single lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=718)|
| 0:12:09| My opinion is that that is a taking, and it is a right that they have in that zoning, and that they should be notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=729)|
| 0:12:17| I don't think that it's a foregone conclusion that everybody knows about this recode, that everybody understands it, and that they've been properly notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=737)|
| 0:12:27| I understand that state law gives us the right to make that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| I understand our ordinance has been changed a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| We voted on it to align ourselves with the state law, and I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| But I think this is significantly different, and it's been reported that there are 70,000 properties in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=757)|
| 0:12:46| I'm mainly interested and concerned about the ones where we're down zoning them from essentially what was R2 to an R1, what we know today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=766)|
| 0:12:57| I think there ought to be notification for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| I think that owner ought to get a postcard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| I think he ought to have some opportunity to appeal that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| A few years ago, we had a very similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| We down zoned at the request of a neighborhood a large track of property from R2 to R1 or R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=788)|
| 0:13:17| The NPC didn't send out postcards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| They sent out those postcards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Those owners were allowed to come in and opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Many of them did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| One particular person said he did not get the postcard, and we sat here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| and that was the main reason that I upheld that, and then I was able to stand behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| It was because we sent out a postcard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| He got the notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| The fact that this particular person chose not to respond to that was his own doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| So I'm very passionate about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| I think we can come up with a list of these people that have vacant properties that we are down zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| and I think we could get a postcard out to them the sooner the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| So what my intentions are is for us to be able to discuss it properly and vet that properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| and to vote on that properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| My intention would be to bring a resolution at the next meeting for that notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| Then we can talk about it, we can hear from the public about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| and then would come with a budget amendment to fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| I'm personally not of the opinion that everybody needs that notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| It's really just the properties that are being down zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| So there's multifamily properties that are being down zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| There's been talk of instances, maybe rare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| but there are some instances where industrial properties are being down zoned to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| I think those property owners need the right to be able to come in and speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| And how we do that and what that process is, you know, we would have to work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| It's my feeling that we need to do it right, not just do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| and if it fits all into this time frame, again, it's done by mid-March, that's fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| But I think there's a way to do it and have a notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| and have a defense for anybody that would want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| and argue why their property was down zoned without their knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| I think that it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| I think it should have been done earlier the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| It would have preferred it had been done a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| It would have probably been with less drama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| But nevertheless, I think this is the way we'll approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| So the rest of the things that I have issues about or concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| and have talked to a number of people about recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| I think we can handle those in amendments one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| So that's my position on recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| Let me respond just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Thank you, Councilman Willis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| That was not really part of what I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| I'm really looking at the schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| and I'm trying to find agreement on starting our workshops on February 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| and ending in mid-March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| If there's a general agreement on that, that's what we'll work toward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Yeah, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| No, I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| I wouldn't push it any further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| I guess that would be my only comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| I would just say that I agree with my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| that it's important that we take the time to do it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| and have people process any of the changes that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| I know that has been controversial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| and there are people who feel like it's had plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| But I also feel that we can do that and do it correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| and not shove it through and get it done with this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| There's no challenge to us getting it done with this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| We might have to add meetings and meet more than we like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| but I think we can manage that and give it due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| and let people give us time to meet with our neighborhood organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| and individuals that want to meet with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| and talk about specific comments that they have about the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| or the final version that's just been out over the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| Councilwoman Singh-Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| I'm in agreement with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| I think a postcard letting people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| and then having their representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| having them come in and discuss that with us is a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| and that that's what the time frame should be built around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| As far as the item that I brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| I'm going to go ahead and assume that people have agreed to the March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| mid-March ending date and that we will take action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| and you can now put on your calendars February 5th will be the first workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| and then Mr. Johnson and I will get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| and figure out the rest of them between now and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| and then set a final get with the mayor to make sure that you're going to be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| and that it's not when everybody's out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Any other reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| At the wonderful suggestion of Councilperson McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| I've worked with the Salvation Army to set up a tour of their facilities for council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| and that tour will be Friday, January the 25th at 1030.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| I hope all council members can join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Just very briefly, I want to circle back to the MLK comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| and you shared about the activities that will be going on in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| I do want to take a moment just to acknowledge that today is Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King's actual birthday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| and had he lived would have been 90 years old today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| For those who have Monday off, we hope that you will participate in some of the activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| but even if you don't have that opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| that you would just take a moment to reflect on Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| that he lived, served, and died fighting for the rights of, some people think, just black people, but for all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1140)|
| 0:19:08| His life was a legacy to nonviolence, for equality and disparities for all people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| particularly people who were disadvantaged and poor people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| and so I hope that we will embrace that and we'll just do some type of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| and show a kindness to someone in memory of him during this holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Okay, we'll move on to ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 10, Article 2, Section 10-27 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| to update and correct language within the city of Knoxville electrical code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| to allow a current city employee to properly pull permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| We'll give a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 5, Article 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| to authorize a spay, neuter, and release program for community cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Okay, Council, we have four people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Do you want to go ahead and speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| So I have, speaking for this, we'd start with the folks who are for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| It would be Janet Testerman, Dr. Lisa Chassie, and Dr. Allison Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| and then I have one person, Billy Cantwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Oh, I'm sorry, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Sorry, it's a woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| And are you speaking against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| So then you would follow those other three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| So those are our speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| So Ms. Testerman, and if everyone, when you come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Keep an eye on the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| You have up to five minutes, and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Janet Testerman, 423 Scenic Drive, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| Mayor O'Hara, City Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| I know that you have been provided with all the data, statistics, dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| of both sides of the debate of trap, neuter, vaccinate, and return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| And the bottom line is we both, both sides are all about fewer cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| We just disagree about how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| Trap and remove and ultimately euthanize doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| We've put a Band-Aid on the symptoms for decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| when we need to be addressing the core problem of overpopulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| and the most effective strategy that we have is through sterilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| No other options other than what we've already been doing work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| nor have they been brought to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| Is this a perfect solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| But it's the best solution that's been proven in municipalities across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| across the world, and it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| We heard from Nashville last time and the impact it's had there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| and Lauren, the director of Metro Nashville, is here again tonight in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| Memphis, Chattanooga, Tri-Cities, Rutherford County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| they have all implemented this program with a successful outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| We are not reinventing the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| As for the overwhelming concern about rabies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| there has not been a documented case of cat rabies in Knox County in 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| But vaccinations are important, and they are part of this program that we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| that we are sending these cats back out healthier than when they came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| You've heard from many veterinarians, both locally and around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| who are, in fact, in favor of TNR, including our own president emeritus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| of the University of Tennessee System, Dr. Joe DiPietro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| who is also the dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| who helped establish Operation Catnip TNR program in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| If that's not an expert opinion and testimony, I'm not sure what is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| We don't want to be a part of a failed program, but we are immensely confident it will be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| But we can come back to the table in five years if we don't feel like it's being successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| or sooner if we feel like there are some pressing issues that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| As you well know, constituents expect solutions no matter how imperfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| and more than 80% do not agree with euthanasia as a means of population control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1407)|
| 0:23:36| We know that, and TNVR represents a vast improvement over the traditional approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| of impoundment and lethal injection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Although the latter approach has been used for more than 100 years across this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| there's simply no evidence that it truly decreases the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| and is a poster child for failed public policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| There's a reason TNVR has and continues to be increasingly popular across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| in communities large and small, urban and rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| Help us get off the hamster wheel in repeating the same failed process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| and enable us to try a new approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| TNVR programs offer a common sense, cost effective, humane alternative and solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| and it is not just better for the cats, it's better for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| and it's better for the wildlife that all of us want to protect and are here to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| So all of us here, we ask that you vote yes in favor of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| and give us a chance to see that this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Dr. Lisa Chassie, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| Keep an eye on the timer, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Dr. Lisa Chassie, my address is 8217 Spruceland Road, and that is out in Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| and the zip is 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| I would like to start by thanking everyone who is here tonight for their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| and attention to this topic of trap, neuter, vaccinate, and release tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| I've been a member of the veterinary community in this area since 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| I've worked in private practice, I've worked in spay-neuter clinics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| and I've worked in shelter medicine, and I've been at Young Williams since 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| I've served as the president of the Knoxville Veterinary Medical Association from 2001 to 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| and I am their representative on the city animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| I have a master's degree in epidemiology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| and I've worked to help decrease the number of unwanted pets in our community for roughly 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| I've also worked as an animal control officer in Illinois when I was in veterinary school for a summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| So this background is pretty diverse, and I state it just to show you that it gives me my current opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| which is that trap and remove, which also means euthanize, does not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| It's not effective in reducing the number of feral or stray cats in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| and it's a waste of time and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Cats are there because they are finding what they need in that environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| whether it's food or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| There's a resource there that brings them to that spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| So removal is just a temporary fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Without sterilization and return, the new cats will simply move back into that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| Trap, neuter, vaccinate, release returns cats to where they came from, now vaccinated and healthier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| and they continue to occupy that environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| The numbers stabilize and decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Trap and remove is reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| Sterilization is proactive and preventative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| According to the Million Cat Challenge, more than 500 communities across the country have adopted TNR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| as their answer to this problem, and it's time for Knoxville to join them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| None of these communities that have adopted TNR have regretted their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| They just simply regret they didn't start it sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| In 2007, Young-Williams launched the space shuttle to remove all barriers to spay and neuter in Knox County and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| This program has resulted in a significant decline in intake for our shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| but we have essentially reached a plateau for intake in cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| That's because cats are incredible survivors, and in our climate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| one single female cat can have up to three litters, an average of six in each litter per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| and by the end of the kittens from the first litter of that season can start breeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| and have kittens before the end of that breeding season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| That's why there's so many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| You can easily start with one and have 20 in 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| TNR ends that cycle proactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| Some say TNR promotes irresponsible pet ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| I suggest that when the community sees how critical it is for even feral cats to be spayed and neutered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| it reinforces the message that every cat needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| It's been suggested that veterinarians do not support TNR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| That's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| This issue is controversial in the profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| but it has been endorsed by the American Association of Feline Practitioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| who really do care about cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Veterinarians care enough about this issue to volunteer their free time on Saturdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| helping out at feral fixings at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| There's veterinarians across the country that volunteer in similar programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Veterinarians do care about this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| We all want to see fewer cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| and it has been shown that TNR programs that are properly implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| can make a difference in the number and overall health of these free-roaming cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| The ordinance before you tonight is a critical stepping stone in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| The program Young-Williams is proposing surrounding this ordinance is multifaceted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| It builds upon the success of our public spay-neuter program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| that has cut our intake rate of cats by half in 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| by adding outreach and education to help citizens get to the root problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| of why the cats are there in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Where the cats are not wanted, we will help citizens make the area less appealing to cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| TNVR efforts will be focused in areas where we receive the most cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| and that's where we're going to have the most powerful effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| We know that we can harness the power of volunteers in our community to help with this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| and that will free up animal control officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| to spend time on what's important, things like abuse and neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| Decades of trap and remove in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| have not lessened the number of free-roaming cats in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Spay and neuter for owned cats has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| and now we need to focus our attention on the cats that everyone sees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| and no one really claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Let's stop wasting time on a policy that does not work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| and adopt this ordinance so we can drive the number of free-roaming cats down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| Thank you, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Dr. Allison Smith, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| You can see the timer up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Hello, Allison Smith, 2000 Cherokee Boulevard, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| My name is Allison Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| I'm a veterinarian, and I'm also the chairman of the board for Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| So both of these responsibilities and roles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| I feel very passionate about this topic, and I certainly support this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1808)|
| 0:30:18| Again, it is a very divisive issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| I know at the last meeting we spent a long time talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| and I think just to repeat what they mentioned, that this is our best option today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| We have for trap, neuter, vaccination, and return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| these efforts have really been ongoing over the past 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| There's currently about 650 jurisdictions that have had a formal policy change or law or new ordinance in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1839)|
| 0:30:50| and these are just proving time and time again that TVNR is the best approach currently that we have to cat population management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1850)|
| 0:31:00| In my mind, the benefits really are that it improves the welfare of these cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| Spay and neuter, vaccination increases their life expectancy, helps body condition, overall health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| We're also facilitating herd immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| This is the idea that you have resistance to contagious diseases if the majority of the population is vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| Certainly we would be contributing to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| The American Public Health Association's Veterinary Public Health Special Primary Interest Group recommends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| that public agencies such as the Health Department and wildlife agencies work with local animal protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| and rescue groups to reduce the number of lost and abandoned pet cats and feral cats over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| and support the well-designated trap, neuter, vaccinate, return programs as the preferred method of management wherever feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1908)|
| 0:31:57| It's also worth pointing out that the American Veterinary Medical Association has reversed a longstanding position on the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| to now use the use of nonlethal strategies as the initial focus for control of free-roaming, abandoned, and feral cat populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1925)|
| 0:32:16| As Janet mentioned, I think euthanasia, mass euthanasia, is certainly not a great option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1936)|
| 0:32:28| and public approval certainly would be a concern there, as it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| In my mind, some of the big issues on the topic that I think in the veterinary community we debate is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1955)|
| 0:32:44| do the free-roaming cats have an effect on the endemic animal populations, birds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| And absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| The evidence here is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Conservation management efforts for birds and other wildlife, I think, require multiple strategies beyond single-species population management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1974)|
| 0:33:04| Secondly, the issue of the rabies risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| Cats just aren't a significant source of rabies in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| No human cases over almost the past 10-year period have originated from cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| And thirdly, this was a big topic last time, was the issue of, are cats a significant source of toxoplasmosis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| And the answer is maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| The main sources are uncooked meat or oocysts in the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| And it's really difficult to know the relative risk of each one compared to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| We don't know which of these routes of transmission is the most significant epidemiologically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2023)|
| 0:33:52| But there are certainly other ways to avoid oocysts in the environment as far as cooking your meat, not feeding raw diets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| washing your fruits and vegetables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| So, again, these are all multifaceted issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| So, again, there's not a perfect solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| What we are doing is not effective currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| And I think that you'd be hard-pressed to talk to any of these other areas that have adopted this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| that you would be hard-pressed to find somebody that doesn't think that it's an effective means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| So I do believe that TNVR programs can and do make a difference, at least on a small scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| They decrease the population of individual colonies, improve the quality of life for those cats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| and the surrounding individuals and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| It can be effective instead of euthanasia in reducing the shelter's overall intake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| nuisance complaints and illness rates will decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| We're unlikely to achieve TNVR results on a scale that successfully controls population in the whole United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2091)|
| 0:34:57| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you, doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| And now we have Ms. Billy Cantwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| Billy Cantwell, 1613 Cove Creek Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, Mayor of O'Hare and members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2108)|
| 0:35:17| I really appreciate you allowing me to speak this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| I am representing KTUS, which is the Knoxville chapter of the Tennessee Orthological Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| And the mission of KTUS is to promote the enjoyment, the study, and the conservation of birds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| First, I'll tell you, I am an animal lover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| The furry kind, the feathery kind, any kind, I'm there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| What I think about trap, neuter, and release is it is a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| We have to trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| We have to neuter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| We have to release that I have a problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| When you release these cats back into the wild, it's not good for them, and it's not good for the wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| And the reason I say it's not good for them is, for example, I have a friend who had a small colony at her business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2166)|
| 0:36:14| and one of the kittens got their leg eaten off by a raccoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| So they live a horrible life out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| Yes, they do have some caretakers that come and feed them, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| they can't take care of them 24 hours, seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| But also on trap, neuter, I think there's a bigger picture we need to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| and things we need to do to improve that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| I have studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| They have studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| I have studies showing that trap, neuter, and release does not decrease the population of cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| It does maybe improve their life with the vaccinations and quality of care they get when they are trapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| However, they continue to live at least six more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| And in that six years, there's a lot of wildlife that gets killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| In a colony of cats, it's very hard to have 100% spay and neuter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| because people learn where cat colonies are, they drop off their unwanted pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| They're moving somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| They're not going to take little Petey with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| so they take them to where they know someone's going to look after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| And these cats are not spayed or neutered, and therefore the colony will increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2245)|
| 0:37:32| Also, I mean, we talked about diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| Yes, there's a chance they can spread taxoplasma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| Okay, take a breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2261)|
| 0:37:42| Take a breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Taxoplasma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| There's hookworm, roundworm, rabies, and there's studies on all that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2265)|
| 0:37:54| So what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Are we just going to continue what they have done since 1954 in the U.K.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| That was the first trap, neuter, and release program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| You look at Rome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| You look at Moscow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| They are covered with cats, and they've been doing this trap, neuter, and release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| There has to be more to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| And that's what I'm asking is that you look and see how we can improve this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| What can we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| My feeling is a feral cat, and I mean a truly feral cat, is one that's not adoptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2304)|
| 0:38:32| It would eat you alive if you got it cornered or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Those cats need to be euthanized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| They're a danger to a child who's in a park where these cats have been released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| and it gets a cat cornered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| Who's going to be responsible if that happens in one of our parks and bites a child?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| So there's lots of things I think that we can do with trap, neuter, vaccinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| We can contain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| We can get them adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| But we do have to euthanize unhealthy and truly feral cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| We can do other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| We need to educate people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| We need all cats, when they're sold from a pet store, to be spayed and neutered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| We need responsible ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| We need enforcement of the law of leash, no free-roaming cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| There should be microchipping for all the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| So if a cat or a dog is lost, we can find who they belong to, get them back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| If that cat got dumped at a colony, we know who we can go after and find for dumping a cat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2383)|
| 0:39:52| that shouldn't have been dumped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| There should be licensing and registration for these cat colonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| They should also show at least a 71% spay and neuter ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| These are just some of the things that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| And one of the things I would also appreciate would they not be released in areas of sensitivity for our environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| like Seven Islands Birding Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Okay, council, those are all the folks who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| Did anyone else address city council on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Did anyone else address city council on this who did not sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| I mean, we heard from three on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Yeah, so it depends on which side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| Yeah, there are still two slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| Normally what we do is you can have up to three people on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| So we've had one person on the side against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| So if council doesn't object, we can allow up to two more people who want to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| I'm a colony caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| I have two cat colonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| So wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Are you speaking in favor of the ordinance or opposed in favor of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Okay, well, I think council, unless council calls on you or asks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| they've heard a lot already in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| So I think they're probably ready to talk themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| But if they have a question, they could call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| So Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Well, obviously, as we heard last time, there's a lot of feelings on both sides of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| I don't want to reiterate too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| But I think ultimately what we're doing with this proposed ordinance is favoring the well-being of a domesticated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2505)|
| 0:41:54| overpopulated animal versus that of a wild native animal that has been in decline for many decades for a number of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2514)|
| 0:42:03| not just feral cats, domestic cats, and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| But, you know, the real point I want to make tonight is we have an animal control board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| that's an advisory committee about animal control issues, and they debated for months chickens in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| So why are we not giving them the opportunity to meet and have a formal discussion about this and bring back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2541)|
| 0:42:29| I mean, at a two-week minimum, they're meeting in two days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| so why don't we hear from the animal control board to have a thorough discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| We've heard a few people tonight, but we haven't heard from the other members of that board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| which I feel like could bring us some valuable information to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| Again, it's a big debate, but I think they deserve an opportunity to meet and have a formal discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| I haven't read any minutes from any formal discussion from that animal control board, and I think they deserve an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| So that's my proposal, is to postpone this for two weeks minimum, to let them meet on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| and have a discussion about this and send us back, you know, their findings on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| And that seems like the logical thing to do for an advisory committee that is in the position on policy of animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| So that's what I would like to see. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Just for clarification, Councilman, did you see the e-mail from the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| So you're just saying more than because they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| Yeah, that was word of mouth, you know, that was sent to our esteemed law director about the discussion that went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2610)|
| 0:43:40| And I haven't read actual minutes of the meeting where that was discussed, and I think we deserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| You know, that was, again, relayed verbally from what I understand, Charles, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| It was just told to you from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| Right, so it was just, you know, again, like, I'm not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| I just wanted to make sure that you did see that e-mail and that you were clarifying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| ...that you were distinguishing between the prior conversation that did occur...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| ...versus you're saying that you want a more formal with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Yeah, I'm not saying it's untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| I'm just saying I would like to see actual minutes because the minutes we received from that meeting of June of 17, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| never laid out any actual language on what was spoken and what was said from who about what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| So I think we deserve that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| To speak first to that issue that just got brought up, my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| I asked at the last council meeting specifically, I called on Ms. Tesserman and Dr. Sousa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| and neither one of them acknowledged that it was ever discussed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| That was my request at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Then we were forwarded minutes where Myers Morton, attorney from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| brought that to the Animal Control Board at the end of their meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| and mentioned that it was a consideration because groups had come to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2695)|
| 0:45:02| because this is practiced in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| TNR is happening in the city, and these folks out here want it to be legalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| so that they can do it without penalty, and the same thing in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| And so Myers Morton brought that to the Animal Control Board and mentioned it at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| got, from what I understand, a very few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| It was not a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| It wasn't a consideration of a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| And my understanding is it went back to the county administration, and it went no further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| That is what was conveyed to me about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| So it wasn't discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| It wasn't an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| I think a motion is needed to send it to Animal Control Board that meets in two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| Ms. Tesserman has mentioned specific items and other options haven't been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| The Best Friends Group, which is the advocacy group and has drafted the ordinance before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| that is their preferred ordinance that they prepared as part of the zero, what is it, net zero, do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2751)|
| 0:46:00| Target zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| Target zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| They prefer that ordinance because it's minimalist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| and there's no other extraneous restraints that would penalize the folks who do TNR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| when done correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| And the different groups that have been mentioned, like the Veterinary Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| and some of the other welfare agencies, suggest that it be managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2779)|
| 0:46:25| And so the Best Friends organization, they have great sections on their website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| that go through all the different legal components that can be attached to an ordinance like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| to address some of the concerns that would come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| Some of the cities do mandatory spay and neuter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| They require all owners of their pets to sterilize and to pay a fee and have exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| So if some cities that have passed TNR have also passed that, why is that not part of a discussion for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| The other thing is Jacksonville, which is deemed a success story from Best Friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| Best Friends cites their ordinance for nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| and how they have a fairly complicated way to file a nuisance that makes Best Friends lobby happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2826)|
| 0:47:16| because it's not easy to file a nuisance suit against a group taking care of a colony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2836)|
| 0:47:24| We have neighborhoods with abandoned houses and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| I know that my colleagues know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| And that's where some of the cat colonies live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| And there needs to be, I know that the veterinarian that spoke here that works at the shelter said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| that they will work with groups or people or neighborhoods that have a problem with a nuisance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| But we don't have any strategy or guidelines for how that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| We have a word of mouth agreement that that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| There's nothing that's been discussed about what recourse someone has when there's a nuisance issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| and if the way they're doing it in Jacksonville that Best Friends is okay with is okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| I think that's worthy of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| The other thing is when this was passed in Hillsborough, Tampa, which by the way has had a rabies case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| and there have been lots of rabies cases in North Carolina in very recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| So there's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| But Hillsborough passed this by paying for a full-time paid trapper to support this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| And they went block by block with the volunteers and that's how they managed to get it in check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| You don't just pass TNR and decrease the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| You have to be very orchestrated about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| And that's why I'm asking why we're not going to have a discussion about doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| If the discussion or the movement is to pass this as a temporary thing or as a one-part thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| and then to come back and look at the other aspects that other cities have passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| then I think that's worthy of consideration and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| We are getting an ordinance from one side of this issue with no input from the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| And that's what bothers me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| And one of the other veterinarians that spoke today just spoke about strategies for conservation strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| There's one ordinance I have here from Lake City, Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| where they talk about buffers from schools, playgrounds, parks, and conservation lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| If nothing else, could we not say no feeding areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| or no colonies maintained next to an area that's a conservation area or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| There's been no discussion because the ordinance that was presented from Best Friends is the minimal ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| but they outlined all the other strategies that could be considered and implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| and beefed up that we don't currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| And those are my concerns with it, that we're not funding a full-time paid trapper to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| that we're not looking at people's nuisance concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| Not only did they fund a paid trapper, they did wrap vehicles and yard signs to try and engage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| and get people more aware of neutering their pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| And I would love to help these folks do those things and make that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| so that this is really realistic and can happen and reduce the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| versus just addressing one component of the issue, which is what I said last time, multi-pronged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| And I feel that we've fallen short in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| And to support of the folks that are TNR here, I've now found out that Lodi, which I pronounce incorrectly, New Jersey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3017)|
| 0:50:27| I said that, I said Lodi to them, and I think they were offended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| That's not how they say it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| They repealed and put a feeding ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| They repealed their TNR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| And I actually wasn't able to get information out of the municipality on short order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Got it from Roundabout Way through the cat friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| And they are very upset that the TNR has been repealed and that there's a feeding ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| But the reason is because they passed a minimal ordinance, so now they've banned and frozen and repealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| because there were so many complaints about the way the feeding was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| People were putting food out on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| So now the feral friends groups are like, hey, there's Facebook groups and posts about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| We've got to train people how to feed properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Please don't go on private property and feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| And I see this lady who wanted to speak is shaking her head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| You understand there's a way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| And that's all I'm asking is that you go about an outline and set out the criteria for how to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| versus roll out something that's so minimalistic and stripped back that you in the end will rejoice in having this passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| and then potentially later have it repealed and have the feeding banned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| because things weren't laid out appropriately for you to be able to do it without some consequence and backlash later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3096)|
| 0:51:44| So those are my thoughts on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| I think this is just, again, rushed and pushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| And it hasn't considered the other aspects of it or funding for the other components that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3112)|
| 0:51:59| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Any other council discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| So what I'm hearing is there is an objection to the concept of trap, neuter, vaccinate, release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3125)|
| 0:52:11| There's more, at least from the two comments I've heard from council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| and many of the comments that we've probably all received from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| there are concerns about the process and sort of what's included in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| So I guess my question is for Ms. Testerman, and I think Dr. Chassie is here as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| who also serves on the Animal Control Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Can you tell us a little bit about sort of the process that got us here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| and what are the other facets and aspects of the community CAP program that's envisioned by Young-Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3159)|
| 0:52:50| And then if there were some additional input from other stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3170)|
| 0:52:58| what would you envision happening during that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| Because I'm sort of hearing that batted around as an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3183)|
| 0:53:12| So addressing definitely several questions and all of that, and a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| I know in Jacksonville, Best Friends did not address that or did not draft that ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| but to that point, NUSA's complaints have been down in multiple jurisdictions across the country since they've enacted TNR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3204)|
| 0:53:35| As for the Animal Control Board, there was a little bit of discussion because the county is also working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3215)|
| 0:53:47| we have animal control agencies on both the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| so ideally we want anything moving forward to be in sync, so we're all playing off the same playbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| To that point, I mean, the responsibilities of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| we've never been charged with developing policy or strategy around ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| and that's technically not within the definition of our responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| But to go back to the actual trap, neuter, vaccinate, and return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| there is a comprehensive program that we have put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| And to outline some of those things here are that coordinate with law enforcement, TNR and rescue groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3260)|
| 0:54:29| volunteers who will help bring cats in for surgery and return cats to the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| and members of the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Develop and deliver educational materials and tools designed to increase acceptance of community cat programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3275)|
| 0:54:42| including presentations, workshops, neighborhood HOAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| This will also include door-to-door mobilization, door hangers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| other collateral to help educate community and promote spay-neuter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| Identifying high-stake areas to intensify TNR efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| we have heat maps that allow us to look at the intake or high-intake areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| that we can then look to see how that aligns with cat intake specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3306)|
| 0:55:14| We're instituting trap rental programs so we can get community members, get colony caretakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| that are willing to bring the cats to us for the spay-neuter surgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| and help us return them back to their location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| We've outlined there are several deterrents that we use as part of the rental program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3332)|
| 0:55:40| and other low-cost, no-cost deterrents that we can educate the community about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| Establish FAQs to explain community cat, data tracking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| provide training and tools for TNR and rescue groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| generate open dialogue to field customer concerns related to community cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| designate more surgery slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| We've got three vet clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| We've got that, but it's also about education on the caretakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| and whether it's feeding programs and help them to know what it means to feed responsibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| and not attract other wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| To that point, in the spirit of the Animal Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| part of what we're charged with is education and training for our officers and through law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| So we have already established training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| Scott Giacoppo, who was animal control for 10 years in D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| came and conducted a workshop for both city and county animal control two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| So it's those kind of efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| We've been given nearly $200,000 in grant money to help initiate and implement this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| And so it is definitely multifaceted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| We can't just do one prong of bring in on day one, spay, neuter day two, release on day three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3414)|
| 0:57:01| It is about education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| It's about outreach, and it's about getting the people in this community to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| and help be a part of this, to bring the caretakers to the surface so they're not running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| so they're not hiding and trying to care for these animals that we're all working in tandem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| to make this a successful outcome, successful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| And we have a designated community cat coordinator, which is a big piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| So she has been talking to you, and Christy Jarvis right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| And that's a big piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| We have a dedicated staff member who's been working with national agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| with other local jurisdictions who've been learning and looking at their toolkits to know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| we're not reinventing the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| We're pulling those resources together to enable us to be the most successful that we can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| Again, we don't want to be a part of a failed program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| We want this to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| We know it can work, and we know that this is the most effective strategy that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| to address the issue of overpopulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Ms. Testerman, were you on Animal Control Board when the chicken ordinance was discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| I was on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| I mean, I've been on there for two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| So when it initially came to fruition in 2009-ish, I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| So it also went to Neighborhood Advisory Council at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| Real quick before I give up the floor, I'll just say if Councilman Campin has an ordinance on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| I don't know if what you said was a motion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Well, I was hoping for a two-week minimum until our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| I don't know if we can digest the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| You know, again, if Animal Control Board is just an internal policy group that works strictly with the dog catchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| chicken monitors, cat people, whatever, the officers, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| But I feel like at the bare minimum a discussion could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| And if they say that this proposed plan is legit and they just do the minimum, we can't strengthen it or make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| I mean, have some input from other than Young-Williams and the feline groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| You know, have some weigh-in from other folks that say we can hone this a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Here's our recommendations, or at least let us read the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| And so I propose I would like to see four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| That would give us a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| But if two weeks is what my colleagues are willing to give up, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| I think we could muster at least some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| And if you all don't, if you like what the proposal is when it comes back to us, vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| But at least give two more days to let that discussion happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| So are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Yes, I'll make a motion for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| The motion is to postpone this for four weeks in order for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| For the animal control board to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| And if someone makes such a motion for two weeks, that's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| I just want to have time for us to hear what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| To comment on the specific aspects that Best Friends identifies as other components that are addressed in other ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3615)|
| 1:00:24| Yes, yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| You made the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| Okay, so we have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Discussion on this particular motion, which is to postpone four weeks, ask the animal control board to review and comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3631)|
| 1:00:40| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Did you want to discuss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Thank you all for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I would very much like to hear from the animal control board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| I'm going to oppose this postponement because they could have come tonight, of course, and I would love to have their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| I would still like to move forward with the original ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| And if there is further input, we should we should consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| But I think we need to move forward with this as a as a step, just like I said last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| This may be Groundhog Day all over again, but I'm okay with the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| So the two issues I think that could be addressed and Mr. Hesterman might address one of them was one was the nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| Once these cats have been released, are they I mean, what if there's another column?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| And then two is about going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| And I know this is a long term program about decreasing cat populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| But, you know, our our reports going to be provided annually or semiannually to to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| And how do how do we how do we judge if the program is successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| And I don't know, Mr. Hesterman, if you want to talk about what other cities have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| I know we've heard that other cities have had success with it, but how do we measure if the number of cats is decreasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3724)|
| 1:02:12| Is it just through calls or, you know, if you'd like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| Well, and I might, you know, if allowable, bring up Lauren from Metro Nashville, because they have enacted it for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3740)|
| 1:02:29| She can speak to how they track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| But largely that the calls, the pickup of cats decreases over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3751)|
| 1:02:39| If they're returned, if they're ear tipped, then and going back to nuisance calls, once they're spay neuter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| those behaviors greatly decrease the nuisance behavior where those calls are originate to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3764)|
| 1:02:53| So, again, if it's Gardner roaming or the yelling, all of those behaviors that are associated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| spay neuter largely eliminates those behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| So those nuisance calls decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| So how you start to be able to track it is, again, intake and pickup of animal control officers of cats in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3787)|
| 1:03:15| So I'll let Lauren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| I'd like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| She has a track record and, again, can speak to and also being on the National Animal Care and Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| which she is, and being a former animal control officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| Please state your name and address again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| Lauren Bluestone of 1526 Ripken Court, and that's Murfreesboro, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| Could you pull the mic closer to you, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| A little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| A little short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| There's a number of ways that we track as far as the census of incoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| We do get a broad picture of how many complaints that we get concerning cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| how much time our officers spend on those types of complaints, the actual intake itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3846)|
| 1:04:14| But we also, if there's areas that are actually targeted for spay and neuter and the trap-neuter release program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| that's really indicative of whether or not this program is successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| So we do look at targeted areas because we also take in consideration other factors in those targeted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3867)|
| 1:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| I know we're still on the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| I mean, I don't see the huge rush, and I think there's potentially room to make the ordinance better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3881)|
| 1:04:52| I'm in favor of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| I think, you know, we contract with Young Williams to handle this for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| They proposed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| I mean, the easiest thing, you know, in government is to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| They're proposing something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| So I think it makes sense to try it and monitor the results over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| But, you know, I'll support the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Mr. Testament, a question for you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| With any ordinance for the Animal Control Board that is currently active or approved across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3920)|
| 1:05:32| with the monitoring of that ordinance, is it the responsibility of the Animal Control Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3932)|
| 1:05:38| once an ordinance is in effect, if the Animal Control Board sees that there are some deficiencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| or some ways that it can be approved upon, is it the responsibility of that board to bring those to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3945)|
| 1:05:52| or to make recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| I mean, I think that, you know, if we are able to, you know, pass this, I go back to are the solutions perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3954)|
| 1:06:03| They might not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| But at the same time, I feel like, you know, what we're doing is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| So we know, again, over 500, 650 jurisdictions have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| So we're not reinventing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| So my proposal would be, you know, can we implement additional measures post, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| passing this ordinance as we go and as issues might arise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| I think that's certainly within, and, you know, if there's a regular review, I go back to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3990)|
| 1:06:37| let's do a comprehensive evaluation at five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| But it doesn't mean in the meantime we can't reevaluate along the way and, you know, tweak the measures that we've rolled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=3999)|
| 1:06:49| But, you know, we've given this a great deal of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| Again, we have pooled resources from people that have done this, from jurisdictions that have done this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| all across the country for years and decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| And so, you know, it's like surrounding yourself with good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| We want to be able to, you know, we're not throwing spaghetti to see what sticks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| We're, you know, it's already laid out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| We have a road map that we can abide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| But can we continue to monitor and assess as we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| I think absolutely we're open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| Just a quick question about the heat maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| Ms. Testerman, sorry, don't sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| And maybe if you can't answer the next question, maybe it's for other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| The heat maps, like what areas of town do they coincide with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| What socioeconomic areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| How many cats are in some of the colonies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| How many colonies are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Where are they located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Those are things that we haven't discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| I'm going to let Dr. Chassie, if that's okay, talk about the heat maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| because she's very proficient heading up the spay-neuter operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4082)|
| 1:08:11| And she's very familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| And I know that, you know, I can go back to colonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| I think there's one behind East Town Mall that started at 45 and it has five at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4095)|
| 1:08:25| Okay. Thanks, Janet, for calling me proficient in the mapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| Actually, I owe a great debt of gratitude to Captain Hubbs from the Knoxville Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| who helped me with the GIS mapping portion of this, and also KGIS has helped as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| Our first mapping was done back in 2010-2011 to look at where to target spay and neuter efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4122)|
| 1:08:50| And the thing that Captain Hubbs found most interesting is the places where we have the highest amount of intake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| the highest amount of animals brought into the center, dogs and cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| correspond with some of our other challenges within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| So, you know, without branding too much, you know, there's problem areas that we need to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| There's needs that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| So, you know, those maps have changed a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| We did have a pretty significant grant from PetSmart that we were able to focus in five of my ten zip code areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4158)|
| 1:09:26| or census track areas and reduce the intake from those five communities pretty significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| with things like yard signs, door-to-door, door hangers, and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| So, yeah, we do have that relationship to be able to help do some of the mapping and monitor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| As far as you asked a question about colonies, I mean, as far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| nobody has a comprehensive database of where colonies exist within Knox County or Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| Just because this is not considered to be a legal activity, nobody's really going to volunteer that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| But people are doing this and, like, you know, people's mothers, grandmothers, fathers, sisters, uncles are feeding these cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4205)|
| 1:10:13| So I personally do think that if you feed a cat, it should be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| I certainly think that that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| I think any cat that steps foot outside should be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| To address the issue of ordinances requiring spaying and neutering of residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| we do have a differential license fee in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| All cats and dogs over six months of age are supposed to be licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| Who has a dog or cat over six months of age that does not have a license in this room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| Well, we don't have to admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| But I believe the animal control, we only sell about 4,000 of those a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| and I have reason to believe we have well more than 4,000 dogs and cats in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| What many municipalities have found is that the amount of time they spend drafting ordinances requiring spay and neuter of citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| doesn't give them the benefit because we want to help people make the right decision because it's the right thing, not because it's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| And the beauty I see of this ordinance where it is right now is, yes, we can amend it and we can add to it and we can improve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4275)|
| 1:11:23| but let's get it off the ground and let's get it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| I did also want to mention for the bird folks, we did take a look at our intake from around the Seven Islands birding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4287)|
| 1:11:36| Very few cats have come into the animal center in the last year from that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| So that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Obviously, we're doing something that is not allowing a population to survive in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| Thank you, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| Okay, so, Council, we have before us a motion to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| Are you ready to vote on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4319)|

| 1:14:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Very briefly because no one wants to hear us talk more about where we are in that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| also I've seen feedbacks, questions, and comments from communities about the brightness of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| lights and I know in some areas that has been responded with lesser lumens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| Can you comment upon that please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Erin Gill, Director of Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| We are actually at the 20% mark so we've crossed the 5,000 light line out of roughly 28,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| lights that we'll be retrofitting through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| Primarily those lights have been in the area north of 40, between 40 and 640 and east of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4523)|
| 1:15:32| Broadway, so Edgewood, Lincoln Park, Whittle Springs, Bell Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| Also south of 40 going out from Cherry Street east all the way through to Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| So that is zone 2, as Siemens calls it, and that zone is substantively complete, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| So they're going to be moving into other areas of the city as they kind of close the book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| on that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| The complaints that we've heard have been very minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| Truthfully, again, out of 5,000 lights, I have heard personally from only less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| a dozen residents who have opinions on one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| Now that said, KUB is also retrofitting lights at the same time and so sometimes there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| confusion and they call us when really it's a KUB light that's causing challenges and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| so we redirect them and put them in touch with the people at KUB if indeed it is a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| light than what we're in charge of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| The kind of solutions that we've offered to citizens, several people have asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| shields on the new lights and we have been able to provide those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| In one case, really there's only been two requests and one person said that solved the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| problem totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| One was a happy customer in that regard and the other one was put in so recently we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| heard that feedback yet, but that has solved a lot of the concerns that people have raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| in terms of light shining into their yard, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| I will say that for the folks that we've heard from who say they're too bright, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| heard from an equal number of people that say they're too dim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| So I look at that as kind of the bell curve of public opinion and the fact that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| heard from less than a dozen out of 5,000 lights so far tells me that for the most part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| folks have been satisfied if not have even noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| So they are welcome to get in touch with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| I'm happy to talk with anybody about how we made the selection that we did and if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| do have a concern about the light spilling into their property, certainly work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| to see if a shield might be a solution that would help them in their particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| So for the brightness complaints, the options are a shield and is there a different bulb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| with lesser lumens or just a shield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| We have not encountered any situations where we feel like a lower wattage light would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| I'm not saying that will never happen, but we have not run into that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| So the shields are very good for preventing light that is, for instance, hitting someone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| front porch and they're feeling like it's coming into their windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| So we've been able to address it in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| But like I said, we haven't encountered any where we felt a wattage reduction would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| Director Gill, maybe we've got about 20% installed so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| Maybe could you comment a little bit on if we're starting to see some savings from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| program already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| So one of the important points, especially as you consider the change order for the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| contract, is that we are absolutely seeing savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| To date, if you look at our 2017 bills relative to our 2018 bills, we took ownership of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| lights last spring, as you remember, and we started seeing savings on our June bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| Just between June and December, we saved $1.3 million relative to 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| So, of course, that is monthly we continue to save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| So projecting out, again, for your consideration for the April extension on the contract, based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| on kind of the average monthly, we would be at $2.2 million saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| That is just on the facility charge component of the KUB bill, which we eliminated when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| we purchased the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| So now that we are finished with Zone 2, we will start now seeing energy saving on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4731)|
| 1:18:56| KUB bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| And so that will be above and beyond, again, the $1.3 that we've already saved and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| $2.2 that we'll expect to see going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| So we will be, again, I don't have a precise number for what we would see from Zone 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| but roughly 60% on our energy charge portion of the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| So we will continue to see dramatic savings now that we can reflect the energy side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4752)|

| 1:20:29| I guess I'd just like Mr. Hagerman or Ms. Foster to talk a little bit about how we got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4829)|
| 1:20:37| here, and then just the, because looking back, started back in 2006 with the adoption of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| the South Waterfront Vision Plan, how we got here those 13 years, and then what can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| we expect going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Sure, I'll get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Dawn Michelle Foster, Director of the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| This was one of the, as you had mentioned, items in the 2006 Vision Plan that was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| in order to provide streetscape improvements for revitalization efforts along South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| Sevier Avenue is considered the main street for the Old Sevier neighborhood, and one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| the components is to create some great circulation in the area, especially now that we have such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4877)|
| 1:21:24| a landing park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| Back in 2009, we had initial plans that incorporated the park, Waterfront Drive, improvements around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| the school, Sevier Avenue, and included a proposed roundabout at that particular intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| at Foggy Bottom, Sevier Avenue, and Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| We moved forward through Mayor O'Hara's beginning of the administration to pull apart a portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4904)|
| 1:21:51| of that because it was all supposed to be done by private development, and the recession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| kind of hit and caused that to slow down, and that didn't move forward with the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| development doing all those public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| So during the beginning of the Mayor O'Hara's administration, we pulled apart with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| value engineering sections to start the public investment, I guess, to kind of spare private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4929)|
| 1:22:16| development to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| So we ended up, as a result, in 2016, we had a ribbon cutting and had Waterfront Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| and such a landing park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| I'm trying to move forward because it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| And that left us Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| So with that, we moved forward and we got a TDOT grant, a state transportation block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| grant with TDOT to move forward for sections between Davenport and Foggy Bottom Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| which is where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| Back in 2016, council approved a contract which included right-of-way and construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| calls for us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| So we had the state and local match already involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| And this is now the notice to proceed for right-of-way, which I'm here tonight just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| to say, hey, we're ready to move forward with the right-of-way portion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| We have 43 tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| We have our right-of-way services group with Vaughn and Milton to move forward with negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| once we get the approval from you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| They'll proceed to talk and negotiate with 43 tracks, which would include temporary construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5000)|
| 1:23:28| easements and right-of-way for that segment along Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| After that, it's probably going to take maybe by summer 2019 to maybe wrap that up, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| we can probably go to an invitation to bid for construction by the end of this year for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| And then how long do we expect construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| We anticipate construction to probably be about 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| So potentially looking at 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| We're hoping possibly, yeah, we've got some underground electric, so we anticipate utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5038)|
| 1:24:05| to go out in front of the project, and then we'll move into roadway construction soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| Everything ties up just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Well, I was excited to see it on the agenda, and I know it's a reminder these plans are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| long-term, and sometimes they take twists and turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| But it's, I think, certainly an area that has tremendous potential, and this should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| help get it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5072)|

| 1:25:38| I just wanted to make a point, which maybe later I'll regret this, but 12C and 12E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| are both properties that are currently zoned, yes, make sure I get this right, they're both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| currently zoned R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| One has been a medical office, 12E, and is being switched to O1, and 12C that Mr. Eaton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| is here for, and I don't believe anybody signed up to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| Lots of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| MPC unanimously passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| These are both properties that in the past were part of a broad spread down zone, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| they were incorrectly, honestly, they were incorrectly zoned for their use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| The one that was a medical office, was built as a medical office, was always a medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| office, and that's 12E, and was broad brushed as an R1A, and then 12C, same story, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5183)|
| 1:26:32| it was in the Mullen neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| So this is a project to try and implement a commercial building in the middle of a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| zone that was down zoned to something that really kind of didn't fit, because it cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| really be single family, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| I think Gerald's motioning that may not be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| The property on Woodland was zoned R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| R1A commits offices as a use on review in 1999, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| The project was approved as a use on review for an office in our R1A district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265190115?start=5217)|
