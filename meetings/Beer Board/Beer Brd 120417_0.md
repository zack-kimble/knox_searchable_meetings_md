| 0:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Spartan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Before we vote on this, you have two events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| One is the Zuffari.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| The other is Feast with the Beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Would you like to give an unabashed plug for one or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| Oh, I certainly would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Two of our biggest fundraisers that we have, and this is the 25th time we've done Zuffari.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| So this is a silver anniversary for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| Last year we brought in over a quarter of a million dollars for Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| And this year we look for it to be as big or probably even bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| So tickets are going real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| So just please give us a call and we'll have a seat open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| And the date on that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| That's on June 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| And we also have Feast with the Beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| And, again, that's a long-time event, and it's on August 18th, 7 to 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Again, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Good luck with your project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| We now are on to the O'Charlie's group, and they've had a little reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| The first one is the O'Charlie's on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| 8077 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| Yes, I'm Dorothy Raines, the general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| 8077 Kingston Pike, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| Let me start over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Ms. Mitchell's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Bring in a copy of the LLC and approval from the building inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| Is that copy on the way, close at hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Madam Chair, my name is Mickey Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| I'm counsel for the local O'Charlie's restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| The closing of the sale of the majority of stock is going to occur on or about May 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| and we will not have those documents until that closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| We actually do not want a beer permit issued until the closing actually changes hands to avoid any confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| and so I would ask that all the permits for the stores be granted on about May 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| when we're able to get the LLC documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| and hopefully by that time any sort of other issues if there are inspections will have been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| But meanwhile, O'Charlie's is continuing to operate as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| They're still operating under the beer permits for O'Charlie's, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Counsel Mandela-Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| I just wanted to have this gentleman, since he was up there, to tell us the basic change here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| is simply in the corporate form of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| These next four are all existing businesses that are operating right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Basically 100 percent of the shares are being purchased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| and they're going to be held by a holding company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| After the purchase takes place, that holding company is going to convert O'Charlie's from a corporation to an LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| FEIN is going to stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| State sales and use is going to stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Management is going to stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Employees are going to stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| So you're going to have the same trained people who know about the drinking laws and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Yes, I move we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Now let's move to the O'Charlie's at 113 Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=558)|
| 0:09:28| Jerome Spruill, work address 113 Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Copy of the LLC and report from the fire inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| I move to approve final documentation provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Wait, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Yes, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| I know we brought this up several times before about people owing money either taxes or fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| and I would like to encourage this gentleman to go ahead and pay his fines that show on record here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Cedar Lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| The record is showing that there's $258 in outstanding fines for Mr. Spruill, probably from past speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=614)|
| 0:10:24| They appear to be traffic-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Sergeant Hunter, do you want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| If you want more information on it, if you don't mind to wait until the end, I can show you the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| I can take care of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=640)|

| 0:11:03| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Spartan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| We need a copy of the LLC and approval from the building inspector and fire inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=674)|

| 0:11:33| Managers Myers and Boyd have not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=693)|

| 0:11:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=703)|

| 0:11:45| A copy of the LLC and approval from the building inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=705)|

| 0:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| I move we approve pending final documentation and the fact that both Ms. Myers and Mr. Boyd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=722)|

| 0:18:38| We just need to get the former beer permit back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1118)|

| 0:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1164)|

| 0:19:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1180)|

| 0:19:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| We need to vote, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| We have an addendum to the agenda, Trader Joe's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| and I think we have someone here to speak for Trader Joe's again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| But that's okay, because I'm watching the progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Good to see you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| John Ebbing from 2132 Branch Oak Trail, Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| Now, you're asking for another postponement, and do you want to explain why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| Well, we probably applied a little too early, actually, to be a little ahead of the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| but construction phase one is getting underway, and I was at the site today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| The landlord will be turning over the site to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| We're looking for a late June or early July opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| Do I hear a motion to extend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| When is our first meeting in July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| Is that the appropriate time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| It's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| It's the end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Would you prefer it to be in June, or do you think you're going to be in in July and save you a trip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| I think July is what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| I'll move that we postpone until the meeting in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Hopefully we'll see you at the grand opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| We have two administrative hearings tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| One is the Roaming Gnome, and we'll start with that one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1278)|
| 0:21:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| We're going to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Did we put one of them in the heel of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| They postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| It's barbecue postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| We are now to the Roaming Gnome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| Michael Clement representing the Roaming Gnome, 716 20th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Sergeant Hunter, do you want to give us a little background on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| On April 16th of 2010, James Duran was cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| The cadet was not ID'd, and the disposition of the case was it was dismissed after a diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| On March 10th of this year, Brian Martin was cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| He did card the cadet, and that case is still open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| And I understand, and, Counsel, we've all seen their remedial plan, and they have paid their fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| Does anyone have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| Well, I guess I would like to ask Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| They did card the cadet but didn't observe that he was underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| I believe it was a miscalculation of the birth date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| I wonder if the gentleman could tell us how you're going to deal with that kind of problem in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| We have added a layer at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| There will be a scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| The math that was run at the door, there was evidently a few months difference for the 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| and there will be a scanner at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Literally scans the license or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| So it tells them pass or stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| It does the math for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| No mathematizing at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| She was ID'd at the door and then not when she was served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Counselman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Well, a month ago we asked for the owner to come and appear before us, and this gentleman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| The owner is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| The owner is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| So have him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Travis Webb, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| I think it would be appropriate to ask the same question to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| He was actually working in the store tonight, and he didn't get a chance to dress up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Do you have any questions for him particularly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Well, I think you should tell us what happened, what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| let's hear it from you, what your plans are and what you all have done and blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| My understanding is that the doorman failed to read the ID correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| Therefore, the bartender did not as well do his job in IDing the patron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| What we've done essentially, I mean, that bartender has been terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| Hard decision, but the gentleman bartended 15 years and had a clean record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| Unfortunately, we have a zero tolerance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| Not to make an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| There's nothing to make an excuse about other than they failed to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Before we proceed, could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Travis Webb, 1283 Beachview Drive, Sevierville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Once they're carded at the door, do the waiters and the bartenders, do they do a second card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Yes, policy is there to do a second check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| It's mainly just as a buffer for the minors not to come in as a secondary check as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| If they're under 21, are they allowed in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| Not after 9 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Not after 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Not after 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| You know, this always aggravates me so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| I mean, you just said that a guy had been with you for 15 years, had a stellar record, and you fired him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| He's not new with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Because your system didn't work, and now you've got somebody with that kind of record that's out of a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| and there's hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| And, you know, I just really begrudge that type of action because it's, you know, the system failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| And the guy had a good track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| And you know probably as well as I do in that industry he can walk down the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| and probably maybe, you know, there's good demand for good people in that industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| but maybe not in these hard times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| But that's just not the answer to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| What is the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Sir, do we have any more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| I'm curious about Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| What is he to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| He had a zero tolerance policy, which is supposed to reinforce the employee's attention to the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| I have no say so on how he runs his business, but I've got the right to express my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| You just feel for the gentleman himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| I'm just expressing my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| In the court proceeding, it came out that there were some other things that this gentleman had in his record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| that affected this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| This was the first time that we knew of that he had any issue until in the court proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| There was some information that came out that led Mr. Webb to the decision to terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| And you took a tough and painful course, but you had to do it to reinforce, I guess, your zero tolerance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| I mean, that keeps everyone on their toes that this is your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| You're not just going through the motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| This is your job is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| It was not done without thought, and it was not lightly done, but it's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| But did you have any subsequent training or discussions with the staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| I mean, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Everybody goes through the training, and they're retrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| And, you know, the way the law reads is they are required to ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| Yes, it was 2 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Sadly, they were not busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| The gentleman maybe is tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| It just didn't happen, and I did not want to terminate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| He's a great employee, but due to the circumstances, I didn't feel like I had a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| I guess my last comment would be you understand what the ramifications are if you have a third offense in 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| And what is that, just for the reminder of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Do you know, Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| It's a third offense in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| In two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| They would come before the Beer Board, or the Beer Board can choose to a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| You guys are aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Sergeant Hunter and I have been talking, and thank you very much, gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| have talked in the past about this issue that they card people at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| and then inside sometimes there are some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| In this case, the failure was in the math at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| But probably one of the biggest issues facing businesses that card at the door is that the people get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1690)|
| 0:28:17| and then they go inside and they're not, either the ID at the door was quickly looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| So we're talking about some things to do that might make that issue go away in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| The second business that has an administrative hearing is Quick Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Quick Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Quick Stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Or Quick Stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| I had the wrong, the Quick Stop Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Just a point of procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| So we don't need to approve anything with these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| We can only reject them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Send it on to administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| 315 Merchants Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Would you tell us a little bit about your plan, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| It's a gas station, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| And now in our gas station on the cash register, there's actually a system where we can put the date of birth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| before you sell to the miner or before you make a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| But my staff wasn't doing it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| They were not putting the numbers in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| They were checking the IDs, but, I mean, it doesn't always mean that you're 100% sure you've got to put it in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| Now I have informed all the staff over there working on the register, and there is no excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| They have to put the date of birth in the register so it's in the record, and it's rejected if it is a miner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| For a sale of tobacco, it's a different date, and for a sale of beer, it's a different date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| And the staff, we have it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| I have sent both of them for the task classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| And I myself, I have done the task classes before, but those people, they just did recently, a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| And now from now, if I hire any other staff, I'm going to make sure that they're going to go for the task classes for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1806)|
| 0:30:14| and they come back with the certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| And periodically we have, now I'm having meetings every three months with my staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| to alert them about the sale of the beer to the miner and also the tobacco as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| and there is no exception on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| On the busy nights like Friday and Saturday, now I have double coverage on the staff-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| so they make sure 100 percent that one guy is making a sale, the other guy is bagging it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| make sure they check the IDs and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Also, I cannot be in the store 24 hours, so from my home I look into surveillance system all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| not every time but occasionally, and see if they're checking the ID or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| making sure, and I did observing since last month to one of my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| One of the staff is my wife, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| The other one is working for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| So the other guy, I've been noticing him and gave him a bonus of $50 too while checking all the IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| especially in the nighttime, you know, especially Friday nights and Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| And I'm doing the best what I can do on that one to make sure we don't sell any more to the miner ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| I just want to say that I was quite impressed with their plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| the fact that the employees are taking the task training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| and I also like the incentive that you have with a $0.50 an hour and then a bonus for a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| and that's a better incentive than any plan that I've seen come before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| So anyone else have any comments, anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Well, thank you, and I hope your wife stays in compliance too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| because that would make it unpleasant at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| And before we adjourn, we have one more point of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Koi Fusion is a business on Market Square, and they do have a beer permit at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| and they have applied for a beer with dancing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| In other words, for those of you who are new to the board, if you have dancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| you have to have a little bit different kind of permit to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| So they have applied for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| What happened is that they did not get their application in in time for this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1941)|
| 0:32:28| and so they have asked that we have a special hearing for them before our next council meeting on May 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1948)|
| 0:32:39| so that they can not only sell beer on Cinco de Mayo, but they can also have dancing legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1959)|
| 0:32:47| Before we talk about that, and I asked for a motion or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| Sergeant Hunter, could you give us a little bit of background about this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| The owner of the business, I think her name is Annie Chen, she owns several other businesses in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1979)|
| 0:33:08| I believe one of her businesses had this same problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| who has been in the unit longer than I have, back a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| It came to my attention they were going to have a party about a month before St. Paddy's Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| and they were advertising a DJ, dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| We went out there, spoke to the two managers on duty, saw the dance floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| told them that they could not allow dancing, that they had the wrong permit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| And on that night that they advertised that party, we came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| and they had covered the dance floor with tables and chairs and were in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| When ABC conducted an ID check special assignment on St. Paddy's Day, I went out with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| and that night we checked Koi Fusion, and they had the dance floor open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| and were allowing people to dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| So I issued them a citation at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| That's the same management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| This is the same management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| This is the same person who would like us to have a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| Now, we have several options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| Because someone has asked does not mean someone shall receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| It also means that we could decide to meet at 6.50 on May the 1st to hear their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| That does require some additional work from the staff behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| So, obviously, Councilman Grieve, you have some thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Well, it's obvious they had tried to do this once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| and they must have known what the requirements were at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| And I'm sure that you told them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| And so I think under the circumstances, since they didn't really comply before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| I don't see any reason for us to do anything special but to let them come to the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| I'm not interested in having a special called meeting under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| And apparently if the person also has been in business and has several businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| they should be well aware of what the requirements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| So I'm not in favor of extending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Yeah, I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| How long ago was the prior incident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| In other words, is this a recent in time thing or way back when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| The incident at the other business that she owns, that was at least two to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| between two and four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| The other officer that works in the unit, I've been there for almost two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| She's been there for just over four, and it happened while she was in the inspections unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| Has there been some change in staff and everything at the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| At the other business, they had gone and filed for the correct beer permit after that issue had come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| and that took care of the problem at the other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| But when the first issue happened and we were told about that party, I went out there and spoke with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| I advised them what they needed to do to be in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| and the fact that the party they were advertising was only a few days later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| they obviously wouldn't be able to get in compliance before that party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Yes, I've noticed that on the application there's a permit with dancing without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| What's the basis for this, and is there a law enforcement reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| Because to me it seems really pretty silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| I almost feel embarrassed up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Just looking up here briefly, but to do the dancing, there has to be a dance floor of a certain size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2180)|
| 0:36:31| I believe it's at 144 square feet or something like that off the top of my head as I flip through the. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2191)|
| 0:36:39| So that's another inspection point, then, the size of the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Well, I guess it's. . . and, Sergeant, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I guess it's also a little bit of a life safety issue that you don't have too many people in one. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| In one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Yes, I believe it's Ordinance 4-58 that refers to the size of the dance floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| and the fact that it's got to be definitively separated from any area that sells alcohol in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2216)|
| 0:37:06| I'm not sure the original reason it was enacted, but from what I was trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| how we enforce it is from a safety standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| For the same reason, they're also not allowed to consume alcohol on the dance floor while they're dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| People start getting intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| They start bumping into each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| They've got a bottle of beer in their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| It also can become a weapon at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| Does that answer. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Do you want to mend your ways or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| Attorney Frost, if you need another second, I've got a little point of clarity that if you're still looking. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| I'm still confused, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Is it the same management, same ownership of the people that complied and then didn't comply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2264)|
| 0:37:52| Yes, it's the same owner that owned the previous business that we had an issue with, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| I don't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Madam Chair, what was the location again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| It's on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| Councilman DeLaValle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Well, let me say that as a practical matter, it's not a particular burden for this body to meet a few minutes early at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2289)|
| 0:38:18| The real question is, is this person going to come and satisfy us that we're not going down a path that is unacceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2298)|
| 0:38:27| I don't know what it's going to take in terms of inspection time when the proper permit application gets here and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| but we certainly don't want to burden our staff to go running around putting off other tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| Maybe someone can enlighten us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Is this a minor thing in terms of inspection time or whatnot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| And I certainly would want to hear from the owner as to their intentions on how they're going to run this operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| No, the owner's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| Councilman Grieve and then Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| I'm in favor of listening to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| I think they've got to come and have everything perfect and, you know, present it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| The question is whether we want to allow them to come and have it before the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| And then the question becomes, if this happens with other businesses, do we want to make this a regular practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| This can become a regular practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| The point here is that it's up against Cinco de Mayo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| But it does not prohibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| They do have a beer license, so they just can't dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| They can drink but not dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| I just wanted to stress again the fact that it's obvious to me that the individual knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| It's also I'm a little concerned that if they wanted this done, that they didn't show up tonight to plead their case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| and to tell us what the situation is and so that we could hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| And so if it's not that important to them to be here tonight to tell us that they would like for us to have a special meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| then, again, I'm not in favor of extending this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Because I'm also concerned what you're saying, Madam Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| that we don't want to start a precedent that people at the last minute say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| oh, well, you know, I'm not ready to do this, but would you have a special call meeting so I can meet a certain date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| I guess I concur with Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| I don't mind at all to meet and try to help a business out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| But, I mean, just the mere fact that the ownership's not here to explain this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| and we've been debating this for ten minutes, I mean, I would have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| And the fact that they just didn't comply before, I mean, I just got a hard time being able to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| I'm going to ask for a motion to approve the request for this special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| Do I hear a motion to approve the request for this special meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| Hearing no motion, it fails, so we will hear their case in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| But they will be selling beer on Cinco de Mayo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| Do you want to talk a little bit more about the rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Actually, it's Section 4-40 that talks about the dancing floor area provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| I did recall correctly that it's a minimum of 144 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| And it talks about, you know, Sergeant Hunter discussed life safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| It talks about the area can't have counters, tables, chairs, or obstructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| And it talks about the aisles for serving people and how that can't be computed in part of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2490)|
| 0:41:38| And it talks about how there needs to be a partition wall or railing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| or other definite means of separation that's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| So from the record, it appears that that's been part of the ordinance since 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| It seems to me that there's a trend of applicants each time for a special permit for a one-time event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2518)|
| 0:42:08| And does our law or ordinances don't allow there to be a caterer to have, like, a floating permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| where they can hire a person to come in and do this instead of having all these one-time applicants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| I believe that there is a caterer's permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| I know organizations such as we had the Scarecrow Foundation tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| they're entitled to receive up to two special permits a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| The zoo got both of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| I'm just trying to think here off the top of my head, Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| about I do know that certain caterers do have permits that they can be hired out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| where you don't have to have a special permit for a wedding that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| If I wanted to have my own Cinco de Mayo party at Crouch Park, can I rent the space and hire a caterer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2572)|
| 0:43:00| or do I have to come back and ask for a special permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| I don't really understand why people keep asking for special permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| Is it to save money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| I mean, it seems to be a pretty big tax load on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Well, the permits, actually, I think for, like, Crouch Park or World's Fair Park, I think are only $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| And those are areas specifically provided for in the city code where you need to go and get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| You can actually get a permit to sell beer on Nathan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| That's one of the areas that's provided for under this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| It just seems like every time there's two or three people coming for one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| It just seems to be kind of a burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| I just didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| I was just asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Well, you could also contact the special events office and find out about having an event at Crouch Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| I'll work on that next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| Any other business before the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Meeting adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120417?start=2632)|
